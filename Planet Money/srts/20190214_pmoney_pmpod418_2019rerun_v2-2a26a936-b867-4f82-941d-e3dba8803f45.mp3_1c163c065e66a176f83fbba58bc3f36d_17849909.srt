1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:02,816
Everyone it's Sarah Gonzales here

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:09,216
I have been going to the trial of Joaquin El Chapo Guzman Infamous drug cartel leader

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:12,544
Just found guilty of all charges against him

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,896
International cocaine distribution using firearms

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,920
And

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,968
Laundering all of his

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
Drag Pro

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,064
Which is the one that were really interested in

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,648
It reminded us of this classic episode that we're going to play for you today

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,464
About the time the United States try to

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
Stop drug traffickers

12
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,584
With a pretty sneaky plan that involved a

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
Decoy

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
Now Indian Chapo trial we learned about all of the elaborate ways that he moved his drug money

15
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,592
Around the US government claims that over his career he earned

16
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,200
14 billion dollars tons and tons of

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,736
Heavy money

18
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,272
That takes up a lot of

19
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,040
Space

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:00,416
El Chapo apparently flew a bunch of his drug money out of the United States

21
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
On his

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
Super stealth

23
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,560
Private jets that are coded in some material

24
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,400
That literally allows them to fly under the radar

25
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,472
And then Chapelwood hide all of his drug money in these

26
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,800
Huge underground Bank size vault

27
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
Because

28
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,432
This is not the kind of cash that you can deposit in a regular Bank

29
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,504
Without people asking where it came from

30
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
So they had to laundry they would like fill a bunch of prepaid debit cards with as much money as they could

31
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
It made it easier to transport

32
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,048
But apparently El Chapo didn't like this method because

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
It took a really long time to withdraw

34
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
$1000000

35
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:47,264
Now the United States has its own tricks and that's what today's episode is about

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,128
Here is David kestenbaum and Hannah joffe-walt with a story that originally ran

37
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
In 2012

38
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
Sometime in the early 90s

39
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,504
A man walked into the US Embassy Annex

40
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,320
He said he had information someone would want to hear

41
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,928
Information on how to go after some of the most powerful drug traffickers in the world

42
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
This guy said

43
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
He was willing to help

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
And what happened next

45
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,352
With the two special agents in Atlanta got a phone call

46
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,680
Skip Latin with the DEA drug enforcement Administration

47
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
And Bill Britton

48
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
With the IRS

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Heard about this guy and thought

50
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
You got to meet him

51
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
Initial meeting was in Ecuador

52
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Keto

53
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Quito Ecuador

54
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
Did you go on that toe

55
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,016
You didn't take me

56
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,600
Do you have a code name for this guy or anything early

57
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Yeah

58
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,720
Yeah he was a it was a code name Dan

59
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,816
That is the least creative code name of Riverhead

60
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,656
Dan the informant work as a currency exchanger

61
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,496
He was the guy you went to if you had pesos and you want dollars or vice versa

62
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,824
And dance with skipping bail he was getting a lot of requests

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
From drug traffic

64
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
Drug traffickers with a problem

65
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
A problem

66
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,480
Don't skip had never fully appreciate

67
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
You're having a very difficult time

68
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
It's just the logistics

69
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
Of laundering

70
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
Millions and millions and millions of dollars

71
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Every week

72
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
Every week

73
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Well yeah

74
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
Imagine the situation

75
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:18,144
The drug traffickers are smuggling all this cocaine into the United

76
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
The cocaine get sold on the

77
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
But

78
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
There's this problem

79
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,800
People buying cocaine aren't paying with credit

80
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
Cards they're paying in small bills

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
KENS 5

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
1

83
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,272
So the drug traffickers have hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in physical cash

84
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
And it just weighs a lot

85
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,904
Bill the IRS agent remembers reading a drug traffickers house

86
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,952
And finding a huge amount of cash

87
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,768
I think it was in like 7 or 8 suitcases

88
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
And it took

89
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
Cannabis

90
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
To what to carry was so heavy

91
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,936
That's so funny I never thought about that but just been

92
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
Satchel mini would be

93
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,080
The unique problem unique to the illegal industry

94
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
The weight

95
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Of the money

96
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
Is huge

97
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
It's absolutely astronomical

98
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
This was a huge problem for drug trafficker

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
There's a problem the traffickers needed Salt

100
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,184
They needed someone to take all that heavy cash and turn it into

101
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
Check or wire transfer

102
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
Something that doesn't wait Huntertown

103
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,839
Basically the Colombian drug traffickers

104
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
They needed

105
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
A bank

106
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
Kearse bail again

107
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
Couple weeks later

108
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,751
Skip an hour sitting down now in Atlanta

109
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
And we're saying

110
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
Let's open up a bank

111
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
Have you ever opened up a bank before

112
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
The first one

113
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,247
You never even have any history you didn't have even ever

114
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
Don't ever work for a bank in my my entire career was with

115
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
You're the Criminal Division of IRS

116
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:49,791
Sort of like it if only somebody could do this crazy thing and then you guys are sitting here later thinking like

117
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
Maybe we can

118
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm David kestenbaum

119
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,567
And I'm fond of Jeffy walk Today Show

120
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
Operation Dinero

121
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,711
Choose secret government agents go offshore create a fake Bank

122
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,039
And launder money for some of the largest and most dangerous

123
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,831
Drug kingpins around

124
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
Support for this podcast

125
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
In the following message

126
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
Should come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

127
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,935
Developing solutions to support strong families and communities

To help ensure a brighter future for America's children

129
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,847
More information is available at aecf. Org

130
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
We came across Bill and Skip an operation to

131
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,735
Because while back we here at Planet Money

132
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:46,367
Got into the offshore Financial World ourselves we created an offshore company in Belize

133
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
Try to get the inside look

134
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
If this whole Secret

135
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Pet World

136
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,279
And when we were doing that we discovered that back in the 1990's

137
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
The US government

138
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,351
Had done exactly the same thing

139
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Except

140
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
The government went

141
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
Way way further

142
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:06,335
Witches believe Bill and skip the two government agents wanting to open the spankbank they chose Anguilla

143
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
An island in the Caribbean

144
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,687
And that is where they imagine their future customers

145
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
We're already banking

146
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
Those areas those

147
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
Offshore accounts are where people launder money

148
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,647
So it just made sense to offer an offshore Bank

149
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:25,791
Operation dinero wasn't the first project Bill and Skip had work done together they had been working together for decades

150
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,351
These two guys are in each other's brains

151
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
They know exactly what the other likes

152
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:34,751
For lunch every day and the day that we met them they were wearing matching outfits

153
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,311
Both in polos and pleated khakis

154
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
And 4 years

155
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,151
Don't skip have been chasing the same guys

156
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,967
Guys like Pablo Escobar notorious

157
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
Drug kingpin in Colombia

158
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,087
I'm so dangerous there are many movies

159
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
All about

160
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Just how bad this

161
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,999
Assassination a billion dollar drug Empire

162
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:01,375
One of the most Wanted Outlaws of the 20th century Pablo Escobar in my opinion

163
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,007
Is the largest biggest criminal the world has ever seen or will ever see

164
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,663
Skip the special agent with the DEA thought about Pablo Escobar alive

165
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,223
He remembers seeing this article in Forbes Magazine

166
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,295
Forbes does this list of the richest people in the world

167
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
And Pablo Escobar was on it

168
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
This criminal was a

169
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Billionaire

170
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
Exactly the kind of guy who needs banking service

171
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
Balance gift set

172
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,071
We should be the ones providing those banking services

173
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
We'll see where all the money goes

174
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
We'll see how the whole operation works

175
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:40,543
And so operation to naira was a go-go and Skip needed a name for their fake

176
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
Bank to service drug traffic

177
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,455
And they thought about it and they said well it should definitely the word trust in the name

178
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,783
And also we should use initials a lot of big-name seem to have an issue

179
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,599
So that shows rhm witch

180
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
Apparently stands

181
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
Words for absolutely nothing

182
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
Nrhm Trust Bank

183
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Was born

184
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
And I was the first time the

185
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
That the

186
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
Any government agency worldwide had established

187
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Hey

188
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
The bank

189
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,007
The sole purpose of which was to track door track Drug traffickers Money

190
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,359
I would imagine that doesn't have not with him like I don't know if it ever happens

191
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,271
Dug out some old photos we had a party at our office when rhm Trust Bank was finally approved

192
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:27,391
You guys are is that champagne that you have the federal facility that's apple juice

193
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
Cycling

194
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
Villain scripted everything you have to do

195
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
For a bag before it open

196
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Stay put it up

197
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Brochures

198
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,655
And made some official-looking IDs and fake business cards

199
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,471
But their Bank was very different from every other bag

200
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
In that their plan

201
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,567
Was to turn away almost all potential customers

202
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,663
It didn't set up Branch offices there are no ATMs no smiling bank tellers

203
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
Just one office in Atlanta with a telephone and a fax

204
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
We didn't want to deal with

205
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
Anybody else's money except

206
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
The drug traffic

207
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,695
You want ordinary people coming inside like to open a checking account and Jack White.

208
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
Villains get born business

209
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
And the way it would work is that the drug traffickers

210
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
We have this cash that needed to be.

211
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
Today facts rhm trust and account number

212
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
Anytime Abbie Burnett

213
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,799
Yes faxes beepers remember this wasn't

214
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
So then whoever is going to pick the money up

215
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Call the beeper

216
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
The guy calls him back

217
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,247
It says meet me at XYZ

218
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Street corner

219
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
At 10 tomorrow morning

220
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
And what kind of car you going to be

221
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
I'm going to be in a blue Chevy

222
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,023
Supposed to give him a code word that Bieber something very simple this is

223
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
I have a package for Amanda

224
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
Then they would call me.

225
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
And

226
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
Package would be exchanged usually suitcases

227
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,751
Are packages from trunk to trunk in a public place

228
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:53,407
It's amazing this is just like every cop so I've ever seen except that usually the government isn't helping the bad guys

229
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Launder Drug Money

230
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,247
What would happen next is Bill and skips guys with takes

231
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
The cash to a local bank

232
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
Deposited into an account

233
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
Onfi rhm Trust Bank

234
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,439
And then why are the money to wherever the drug traffickers wanted

235
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
Is it sent you

236
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
And all works

237
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,327
The drug people were very happy with rhm Trust Bank

238
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Dylan skip

239
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
We're getting closer

240
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,703
They're learning all this stuff about the money laundering world

241
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
There they are wandering around this

242
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Dark place

243
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,847
And they start bumping into all these other people who exist in the dark

244
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Like

245
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Princeton

246
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,479
Turns out they were not the only ones offering Financial Services to drug dealer

247
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
It was a busy place

248
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
With established rates for doing this kind

249
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
We were competing against

250
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
Other money pickups

251
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
So if that skip says I'm going to charge you 9%

252
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
Well then you come to me

253
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
I'm going to charge you eight and a half

254
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
And you go back to

255
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,119
Skip it cuz I got somebody 8 and 1/2 he's okay I'll charge at 8

256
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:50,239
You're in a competitive Marketplace very competitive market and we had to make sure we were

257
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Not so cheap

258
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
To be suspicious

259
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
But not so high that we wouldn't get cussed

260
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Words

261
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,479
Spread and soon more and more orders were coming in

262
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
Which forbidden skip

263
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
More information

264
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
What were the tricks that the

265
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
I always laughed at 4

266
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Skip one of the fighter Hulu

267
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
True owner the money was

268
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
He would delay by 24 hours and sending the money

269
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,447
And then we'd get telephone calls and find out o that that person comes out of the woodwork when it looks like that the money maybe in Jeff

270
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
We picked up more information

271
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
By being a bad Bank

272
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,639
Who didn't handle money quickly and effectively

273
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,711
It's high net-worth individuals net worth individuals yes

274
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
In in Risky Adventures

275
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
Bill and skip

276
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:40,415
Or winning their trips the drug dealers they gain their trust they had them right where they wanted them

277
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,279
But at the same time Bill and Skip we're becoming more and more aware that they weren't

278
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,095
Fully understanding the money laundering

279
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
That they were taking

280
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Kincardine

281
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,239
Like they were constantly things that didn't really make sense they pick up money off

282
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
The street and then they be told to wire it

283
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
Not to Columbia where the drug trafficker

284
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Chris were

285
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,455
But to some legitimate American Business that was selling like

286
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
Tractor parts

287
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
Was all very confusing

288
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
There were a lot of smart people

289
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,463
Involved in bad end of it X Bankers money Brokers that have been doing this for Generations

290
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
And it was to me

291
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
The complicated system

292
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
What Billings get for uncovering

293
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Is now called the

294
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Black Market

295
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
Peso exchange.

296
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,959
The series of cleverly Disguise money transfer

297
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,775
Convert the drug money that was stuck in the United States

298
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Yen to peso

299
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
Was back in Columbia

300
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,151
It works by hiding the money in the normal flow of trade in

301
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
Payments for things like tractor

302
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Surveillance gif

303
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,063
We're nearly there they were inside this complicated Market Place

304
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
I'm close to figuring it all

305
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Out

306
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,183
Until at 1 moments they came

307
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Extremely close

308
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
To be discovered

309
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
Not by the drug traffic

310
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
But by their own people

311
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Buy us

312
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Bankrate

313
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:58,751
Sad to say David we don't spend a lot of time in the show talking about how Bank Regulators are doing

314
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Job

315
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,335
But in this situation

316
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,895
They did exactly what you want Bank Regulators to

317
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,735
Regulators at the office of the Comptroller of the currency this

318
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
Us regulatory agency that

319
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Deutsche Banks

320
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
They showed up with some questions about

321
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
Rhm Trust

322
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
The head of security call me up

323
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
NSAID

324
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,583
Come on over here the OCC is here and there auditing your account

325
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
You better get over here right now

326
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,471
And so I walk over there talk to the otter talk to the

327
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,311
Hey what are you telling me I had told him that he had to uncovered a yo

328
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
October Governor operation

329
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,479
Congratulations please don't tell anybody and he said

330
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,087
Be stopping the audit right then and there like by the time I got back to my car

331
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,183
I got a call from the OCC supervisor saying they were in the process of shredding

332
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,511
Their notes and everything else they copy but they had already notified

333
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
The OCC in Washington and Washington

334
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,167
The next morning was going to send a fax out to every OCC Bank in the world

335
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
How are the United States

336
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
Notifying them that rhm Trust Bank

337
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
Was not a bank

338
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
How to do transactions with

339
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,919
But what happened then so they're going to set up this facts about the facts

340
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
We got there in time to stop the facts and

341
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,855
Matmen your cover with almost blown there almost within within 24 hours we would have been in

342
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
In trouble

343
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
If we live it stopped

344
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,767
Rhm Trust Bank existed for a little less than a year and the drug guys

345
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
Never figured it out

346
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,863
And yes I killed the bank

347
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
It was success

348
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
We got we got to be a little too popular

349
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,055
We were being approached our informant was being approached

350
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
Poor poor other offers to do it

351
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Illegal things

352
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
And that wasn't our Target

353
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Getting out there asking you to do stuff you like

354
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
We were authorized to do a and b

355
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,599
And they're asking us to do C&D

356
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
Why can't you do send

357
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,535
The correct answer that question is we can't because we're actually undercover agents and we only got approval to do certain kind

358
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,119
Kaiser transactions with you so we can't give you a loan or whatever else you want each other

359
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,447
It just got to starting to be get a little bit out of hand

360
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
7 decision was made to shut the bank

361
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:12,127
By this point it had uncovered a drug Network that extended to lots of different country

362
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
Italian government particular was eager to start make

363
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
So billing skip scramble

364
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,063
To coordinate a massive simultaneous but

365
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
After the break

366
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
The big

367
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
But

00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
Support for this podcast

369
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
In the following message

370
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
Did you come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

371
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,887
Developing solutions to support strong families and communities

372
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,215
To help ensure a brighter future for America's children

373
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,799
More information is available at aecf. Org

374
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,431
Just like in the movies you want to pounce on everyone all at once so one guy can't warn his friends

375
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
Hey the cops are showing

376
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Hide

377
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
And so at a specific time it began

378
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,367
116 people connected to rhm Trust Bank

379
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
Four different countries

380
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Well rested

381
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
Bill saw a video of what happened in Italy

382
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
They showed

383
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
The police precinct and they were like

384
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
2030 of these little teeny

385
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
International police cars

386
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
And all of them scream out of the

387
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Doubt of the

388
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,519
The Compound at one time and they going all different directions like ants

389
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,359
And they didn't show The X hours later than bring it all these

390
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,943
Fugitives are arrested people back in but it was

391
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
It was quite

392
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Quit heroin

393
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,575
What did it feel like to watch that

394
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
I was exhausted

395
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,415
I was exhausted was finally over with

396
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
Efficiencies 9 tons of cocaine

397
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
And more than 90 million dollars in cash

398
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,607
But of the over 100 people arrested

399
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,423
Billionaire Pablo Escobar was not in that group

400
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
He remained out there

401
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,775
In fact Stephenville did not bring down any of the Ring

402
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,335
They say what they did do

403
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Was make the drug guys Wonder

404
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
About who they could

405
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,967
Usually the secrecy of the offshore world

406
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
That is a problem

407
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,831
For the government for guys like Bill and Skip cuz it hides all the illegal act

408
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
But this time

409
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
It hit them from the bad guy

410
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
And it hurt the drug trafficker

411
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,535
I know one thing they can't trust a bank now

412
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:11,935
As a result of of of what happened here they can't they have to be careful and think twice if they go to a bank

413
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:16,543
To to trust them to handle their financial transactions

414
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
Could be could be another government Bank

415
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,687
You guys feel like you're winning the money-laundering battle or is it

416
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
Just a matter of setting a bag for Fears and they find some other way

417
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:32,927
I think I think we were winning 20 years ago and I think we're winning today

418
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,511
Because a wind doesn't necessarily mean you stop it

419
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,583
You changed therefore the methodology for doing it

420
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
And I think that was one of the greatest successes of the bank

421
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
That we are able to

422
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,263
Get them off of a very sophisticated

423
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
Process

424
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
In a bulk shipment

425
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Bulk shipping

426
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,431
Taking all that heavy money and physically sneaking it across the

427
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
To do that you don't need an offshore Bank

428
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
You just need a truck

429
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
The show originally aired in 2012

430
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:11,327
