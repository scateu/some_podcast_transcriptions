Professor story up to trick you into coming here

00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
The Florida avocado

51
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,216
They're terrible and explain nothing about the world economy

52
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
Actually

53
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
The caretaker of this house

54
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
And there's something you need

55
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,064
Andrew Ross Sorkin too-big-to-fail just blew up that show

56
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:40,256
Tim Geithner Stress Test why did why did all of these financial crisis books have to be 500 pages long

57
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,072
Flying off of the Shelf caretaker what's going on

58
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
Yes

59
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
This is what I needed you to see

60
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
Every night when the clock strikes 11

61
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Crazy

62
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:54,848
Portrait of Ben Bernanke starts walking

63
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
Take me to Sonic

64
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Listen

65
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
I would have hired some paranormal

66
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
All of this

67
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,344
It all seems to be related to 2008

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
2 to the financial crisis

69
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
I didn't know what else

70
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
So I called

71
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,584
Planet Money and you want us to you have until the clock strikes midnight

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Florida house

73
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Spell save you the trouble

74
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,216
There's no cell phone reception here all the doors are locked

75
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,056
The only outdoor space you can access at the cemetery with 15 foot wall

76
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
You're not allowed in the basement and

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
One less

78
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,456
Piece of advice take a look at the bookshelf

79
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
Sally there's only one book left

80
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:40,416
Crashed how a decade of financial crises changed the world the Adam tooze books thank God that didn't fly it's like 700

81
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
100 pages I mean

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
If you just try to pull it off the shelf secret tunnel

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,984
Do olives have to shout into every Lord space is how we show up at the room is

84
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
Caretaker until midnight

85
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
She's gone

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
So now we are alone

87
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Trapped in a haunted house

88
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
Okay not great not great

89
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
But let's think this through reasonably

90
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Split up

91
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
Without the Bernanke portrait

92
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
The two of you should split up to explore the house

93
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,488
Probably a good idea I'll pick secret tunnel

94
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Do you have your iPhone to record yourself

95
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,935
No I turned on the voice memo recorder and then secretly planted it on that caretaker

96
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Nothing weird about her

97
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,543
She totally reminded me of somebody but you still need a recorder so here take my cell phone

98
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
What's with your battery don't go until you absolutely need to let's do this

99
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
Shutting down now

100
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,039

Conservatory

118
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,023
Apparently I have 45 minutes to wander around this haunted house and I guess

119
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
Let's find out what ghost from 2008 or so

120
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863

00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
Accommodation can be made for a

124
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
Measured course

125
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Poisonous

126
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
Stereo pad

127
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
This is impenetrable fed speed

128
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
I can't

129
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Sally

130
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Irrational exuberance is

131
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
Conceptually identical

132
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,183
2 and the inverse of stagnation I know you're trying to tell me something but I have no idea what you're

133
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Fine

134
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
How's this

135
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
Go outside

136
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Oh

137
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Okay

138
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
I will go into the graveyard Sherman

139
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
So

140
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Why headstones out here

141
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
Here lies wage growth

142
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
Dead since 1970s

143
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663

Sally Helm

146
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,647
That's me straight

147
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Are you

148
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,463
Are you zombie

149
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Me

150
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
Your

Dad you're like 80 years old I'm rich Sally

152
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
I'm rich salad

153
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
Dicey

154
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:37,311
You are wearing a fancy ball gown and have a diamond ring on each finger I'm the version of you that died

155
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
Biden 2008

156
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
The financial crisis

157
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Crushed American GDP

158
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
That cost you around

159
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,503
$70,000 over your life

160
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,367
And that's just the per capita measure estimated by the San Francisco fed

161
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
The real cost

162
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,975
Is what happened to your mind

163
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
My mind

164
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
You

165
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
Your whole generation

166
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Afraid to buy home

167
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Afraid to start Building Wealth

168
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Parents

169
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Yeah I mean

170
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,847
I guess I do feel like there's a pretty good chance I'll never own a home I bought the most beautiful

171
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,895
By the ocean in Maine

172
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
I live there

173
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
But you don't get to

174
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
Can you please tell me about the stuff the financial collapse

175
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
Didn't ruin for me

176
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Like

177
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
How Did I Get Married Too ever learn to play the mandolin

178
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
Who was the living at the end of Game of Thrones

179
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,071
Oh my God I forgot you haven't seen it yet

180
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
So

181
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
Cersei and Jon Snow

182
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Which

183
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
Have to be authorized

184
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
Please tell me

185
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
Hello hello

186
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
Secret tunnel

187
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
Opens up to the

188
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Kitchen

189
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
Which opens up into

190
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
The ballroom

191

00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Our 100%

383
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Totally in Forbidden

384
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
Planet Money Robert Smith

385
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,783
I thought you were supposed to be off during summer

386
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
Prestigious Fellowship

387
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
That was

388
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,671
The plan but I got lured into this house by a fake story about a

389
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
Cube satellite

390
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
Cartel Robert how do I get some light in here

391
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,887
I got your light right here I thought you were

392
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,679
So it's going up to report MacBook

393
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
I was told on good information

394
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
But there was this town

395
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,615
That was still on the gold standard and was doing Universal basic income dream come true

396
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,687
No here I would have been a good story

397
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,503
Jacobsen stuck here longer than I have

398
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
Actually learn how to make candles

399
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
Ear wax

400
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
I got your candles right here

401
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
So many candles

402
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
Well

403
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
This basement is

404
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,255
Literally a crappy podcasting Studio

405
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,631
Congratulations you're now part of the haunted houses new family

406
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,447
Podcast version of the existentialist nightmare

407
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,055
We have to be in this house forever making podcast about the financial crisis

408
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
That no one will ever live

409
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,383
Can I ask you guys a question

410
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,967
Just a caretaker remind you of anyone

411
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,807
So familiar I cannot put my finger on it yet totally

412
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
We couldn't place it either

413
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
Oh no

414
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:41,279
I just remembered I secretly planted my iPhone and that care different Pockets a lot of good that does Us in the basement now

415
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
Here's something that could happen

416
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,679
I keep my phone in one of those special cases with extra juice

417
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Right

418
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,519
Arabic word for I don't know days on end

419
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Makes sense

420
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,591
And if his house as open WiFi

421
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,735
My recording should automatically back up to the secret Planet Money

422
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,087
But yeah you're right we'll never got to hear it down here in the basement

423
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
Oh crap my record is about to die

424
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,743
I have something that I need to tell you because I have spent

425
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
These months

426
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375

File cuts off

431
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,407

How to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain

447
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,535
So I quickly went through that 72 hour-long recording and

448
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,327
Most of it is just like

449
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,887
Pocket sounds and some lady humming to herself

450
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
But

451
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
There's this super weird bit at

452
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
At the very end

453
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,823
It seems important I don't know I'm just saying the planet money in

454
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Turn butts

455
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:35,199
I think if I play this bit for you it might explain like

456
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
Everything

457
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Okay

458
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Here you go

459
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463

00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,607

00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Yes

462
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,111
While wandering around me

463
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Yes

464
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744

465
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704

466
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,008
Everyone's in the basement

467
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,616
Never see me anyway do I really need to be in this caretaker disguise right now

468
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,944
Change back

469
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736

00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,856
When are planets this planet money family of yours is going to be pretty big so

471
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,208
If you could afford to let me go

472
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,048
Georgia power Federal Credit Union

473
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,096

Yeah we know that's a lie and Kenny and Robert and also Jacob were all in there

482
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
Sally in Chinese recording

483
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:33,472
The rescue email with these recordings and detail directions to the house

484
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:39,872
Oh crap this is a total trap

485
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
Hello

486
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,856
I mean hello and welcome Planet Money

487
00:22:55,488 --> 00:23:00,096
I found these credits on K Mullins desk

488
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,376
They say

489
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,216
Please tell the world they should be listening to a podcast called

490
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752

00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
Made by professional sound designers

492
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,640
Patel's amazing stories about the most famous sounds in the world

493
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,944
And there's a little note here Kenny Reitz

494
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,272
If I ever make a weird Halloween episode of Planet Money

495
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:23,136
I would absolutely make that in collaboration with the amazing team that makes twenty thousand Hertz

496
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,304
Alex goldmark is Planet Money supervising producer Brian Atwood editar stories if he were here

497
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,888

And if

503
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,896
Looks like there's one final note here from Kenny

504
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:50,528
Theoretically I ever needed someone to pretend to be the knowing caretaker of haunted

505
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,344
House or the Victorian child ghost

506
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
I would definitely use voice actor

507
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
Jan John's

508
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232

516
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
Shutters
