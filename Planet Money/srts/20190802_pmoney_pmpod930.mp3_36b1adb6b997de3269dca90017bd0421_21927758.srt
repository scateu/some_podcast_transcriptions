00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,816
This is planet money from NPR

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,632
When I was about 9 years old

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,424
My sister and I were brought

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,240
To a University campus in Los Angeles

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,520
To be study

6
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,592
I remember going up in the elevator and being very intimidated

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,920
Just about the whole setup and this is my sister Eliza

8
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:18,944
So

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,224
They split us up

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,272
Eliza got taken into a separate

11
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,344
Room and I think I was the first one with

12
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,416
Okay Sally tell me more about the

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,744
Escap well it was a shower cap looking thing

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
It was like

15
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,584
Gel in the hole and the little holes in them

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,632
Wires coming out of your head and I like

17
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Electrodes

18
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
The scientist

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,216
Put this thing on her head

20
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,496
Connected those Al

21
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
Electrodes to her

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,032
Her scalp

23
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
And then

24
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
They turn on the

25
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
Anime Shota

26
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,664
Videos

27
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
That were

28
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
Disturbing

29
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,248
Or side work

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
Scary

31
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,672
In the other room

32
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
A different researcher is

33
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,744
Quizzing Little Sally and

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,512
The questions were

35
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
Weird

36
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
Yeah they asked me like

37
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,584
Have you ever

38
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
Anyone with a brick

39
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,168
Broken bottle or bat

40
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
No

41
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,496
Have you ever pinched anyone

42
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
Yes

43
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,592
Have you ever pinched anyone besides your sister

44
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
No

45
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
We also have to play it

46
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,432
Computer game

47
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,480
Finished mazes

48
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,576
My sister and I played Bop-It together while the researchers watched us

49
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,880
And it on nine-year-old brains

50
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
Just trying to figure out like

51
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
What are they

52
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
Seeing right now

53
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,536
Why are you showing me that there has to be something

54
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
There was

55
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
Something a big something

56
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,912
Sally and Eliza are very important

57
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,728
To science because they are not just cisters

58
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
They're twins

59
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
Yes we are fraternal twins and you Karen you also have a twin this is true I do we

60
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,432
Are identical twins

61
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,480
Yes hello

62
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,808
Wow you do really sound a lot like Karen

63
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
Sally last week we got all of our twins in the studio to get to the bottom of this twin study and the many many

64
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
The other ways the twins have been studied because

65
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,304
I promise I'm not just saying this

66
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Because

67
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
We twins

68
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
We are this lucky break for science

69
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,496
Twins are a natural experiment in genetics

70
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
Help scientists answer what is

71
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,848
Perhaps

72
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
Biggest question of all

73
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
How much control

74
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,552
Do we actually have over our own lives do we have like

75
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
Free will

76
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,928
And this is not just a philosophical question or even a scientific one

77
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
The answer has

78
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
Real world applications for things like

79
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
How the government spends money how we

80
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,632
AR laws for a lot of the things we talked about here at

81
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
Twin studies help us understand things about our men

82
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
Mental Health

83
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
Earning capacity

84
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,848
Ability to learn our propensity for addiction

85
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,432
Whether we hit people with bats broken bottles

86
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,528
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen.

87
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
And I'm Sally home

88
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
Today on the show how did we get to a place where nine-year-old Sally and Eliza were sitting in a chair with electrodes

89
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
Sticking out of their heads

90
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
For science

91
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,912
We go deep on the history and design of

92
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
The twin study

93
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,264
We perform a micro twin study on our own sisters

94
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,104
We learn what those researchers were studying that Electro cap

95
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
And weep for the dark

96
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Side of twin

97
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944

That's npr.org Planet Money newsletter

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,143
We decided to do this show today in

122
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,543
In part because of a very strange coincidence by the way happy birthday happy birthday your birthday is the same

123
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
You and I and our twins all four of us

124
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
Were born on the same day

125
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,527
This is true that day is today August 2nd the date of the show is airing

126
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
That is what got us think

127
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
Think about twins and the experience

128
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,231
Yes and the experience of being a twin is one of constantly being

129
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
Pretty much any time we meet someone new people

130
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
First freak out about how much

131
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
We look alike Destra like

132
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
Hair talk like

133
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
And then

134
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,311
Question beginning which are always the same yes my sister and I don't look alike but

135
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,383
You got these two we ran through these without twin

136
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
So

137
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
One we always get

138
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
Can you read each other's minds

139
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
Do you know what a life is thinking Sally

140
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,159
What else

141
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
Do you feel each other's pain

142
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
No

143
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,143
Who's older Murray I have 2 minutes on Karen so I

144
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
Lord that over wisdom

145
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Right

146
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,543
Experience she looks up to me

147
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
Something rain this kind of

148
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Fascination that we

149
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
It's everyday

150
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,687
That Fascination is what

151
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
Sparked the very

152
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
First

153
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
Twin study

154
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
All the way back in the 1800

155
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,879
The researcher was a man named Francis

156
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,743
Carlton Carlton was the one who kind of like harness that existing cultural fascination

157
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Entered it into

158
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
The scientific proof

159
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
History of heredity

160
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
This is Allison cool she is like

161
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,007
Russian nesting doll of twin study researchers

162
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,615
She is herself and identical twin who studies researchers who study twins

163
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,943
Social studies the history of twin studies and

164
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,271
She is an assistant professor of anthropology at the University of

165
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
Colorado Boulder

166
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,111
Alison told us that Francis Galton was a

167
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,415
Gentleman of Science in the late 1800s

168
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
He was actually Charles Darwin's cousin

169
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
And while cutting

170
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Charles had

171
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
Obsessed over finches

172
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Carlton

173
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Became obsessed

174
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
With twin

175
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,471
You trying to understand why parents

176
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,775
And their children basically why relatives

177
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
Had such

178
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
Similar to

179
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
In other words

180
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Heredity

181
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Animals

182
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
Similar seasoning relatives that he

183
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
He could find

184
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Which way

185
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,575
So go out and found a bunch of twins had them answer a bunch of questions

186
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
The terms identical and fraternal had not yet

187
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
Open coin but he knew that some Twins were what he called

188
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,999
Similar and others were

189
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Dissimilar

190
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
So she asked for information about the

191
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Their appearance there

192
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Behavior

193
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
And based on what he hears

194
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
Back from these twins he makes this

195
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
The similar twins

196
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,335
Stay similar because they have is like being born nature

197
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
And the dissimilar twins

198
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Dissimilar

199
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
Because they have different natures

200
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
And in the paper that he publishes

201
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,855
He uses this freezing that we now probably Oliver

202
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
Recognize

203
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
He talks about nature

204
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
End

205
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,743
Stepping back for a sec

206
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,583
Studying heredity like this or what would become known as

207
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Is genetics

208
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
I can bring you to this

209
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:39,263
Like for example say a researcher discovers that genes play a role in some

210
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
Particular disease

211
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
You can take that information

212
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:47,967
And take that's great that helps us figure out how to spend money to better research or treat this.

213
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
But

214
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
If you assume that genes are

215
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Our Fate

216
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,391
Then you can take that same information and go down

217
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
A very dark

218
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
Instead of trying to treat that disease

219
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
Someone could say let's

220
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,607
Breed that disease let's breed that Gene out of human

221
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
Francis Galton went down that day

222
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Eugenics

223
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,287
Literally means I think the science of being well born

224
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,895
But also a social movement

225
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
About

226
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
Making sure that

227
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
Only the fittest

228
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
Are you able to reproduce

229
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
These ideas

230
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,623
Led to forced sterilization

231
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
Even outright murder

232
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,975
Eugenics took hold in many different countries

233
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Including the US

234
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
All of the

235
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,095
Kind of like biological research in that era

236
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,959
The flavor of the flavor of like weird

237
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Racism

238
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,591
These ideas and the twin studies that gaulton use to reinforce them

239
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,687
Showed up again when the Eugenics movement was taking its most terrifying

240
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
There's a direct trajectory

241
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,039
Rotten cotton to

242
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,367
Like A Nazi twin experiments

243
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,439
Nazi researcher Josef Mengele performed

244
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,767
Grizzly human experiments including many experiments

245
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Saint twins

246
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
He infected them

247
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Typhus

248
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,143
He did surgery without anesthesia

249
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,471
Used twins to study heredity

250
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,799
In hopes of propping up the Nazi program of so-called

251
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Racial hygiene

252
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:25,247
Soap understandably for decades after the war i attention shifted away from heredity and people stay

253
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,319
Started focusing more on nurture on the effects of the environment

254
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
But then about 1980

255
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,999
Get this crazy story crop top

256
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:40,095
It was a big pop culture moment

257
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Reinvigorating twins.

258
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
And pushing the pendulum back

259
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Portal Focus

260
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Longines

261
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
There was this highly publicized

262
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Braided as babies

263
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
And then reunited as adults

264
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
And that all of these crazy similarity

265
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
For one thing they were both

266
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Kim

267
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
Jim Lewis

268
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
And Jim Springer

269
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
Nope

270
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,975
How to say there is no Gene for being named

271
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
That is just coincidence

272
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
But

273
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,351
Are researcher at the University of Minnesota

274
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
Thomas Bouchard

275
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
He hears about the gym

276
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
And thanks

277
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
These

278
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
Are the research subjects

279
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
I have been look

280
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Looking for

281
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Identical twins

282
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Raised

283
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Apart

284
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,943
To understand why his study ended up becoming so important

285
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
You have to first understand how normal Twin Cities

286
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
Studies of twins raised together

287
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:38,207
The reason why twins are so amazing for science is because you have this natural comparison

288
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
You got identical

289
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
Twins who inherit identical genes

290
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
And

291
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
Fraternal twins

292
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,167
Couch are on average 50% of their genes

293
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,007
And actually we are not just going to occur

294
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Blaine all this

295
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
Back to her sisters in the studio

296
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
We are here to conduct a micro twins

297
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,711
Unsteady mini scientific

298
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,575
In the studio in the collective Studios today we have a set of identical twins

299
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
And a set of fraternal

300
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
And that is what you need for a twinset that's right

301
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Of course you need

302
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Manny Marquez

303
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,047
So what twin researchers will do is

304
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,375
They will pick at trade or behavior something that they want to stay

305
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
If on the whole

306
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
Identical twins are more

307
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,031
Similar to each other than fraternal twins are

308
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
Then that suggest that

309
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
Genes or DNA

310
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,151
Play a role in why

311
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
Some people have that tree

312
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
For our mini study

313
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
We picked lateness

314
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
At what rate to look at

315
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
Are you a late person or an on-time person

316
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
And

317
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
My fraternal

318
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,255
Merced Valley the late one and

319
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
So we are

320
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
Different on the

321
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
And then I asked my ID

322
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
Twinberry

323
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
How are you on lateness

324
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
I

325
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,543
It's bad to be a very intentional act to become a moron Time Force

326
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
I would say that I'm the

327
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Like I

328
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
I've been working very hard

329
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
In our micro twins

330
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
Study the Fraternal

331
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,295
We're different

332
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
And the identicals were similar

333
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
Take me to fairly strong genetically

334
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
Here today

335
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:20,607
So back to the Jim Twins and that researcher Thomas Bouchard in Minnesota who wanted to study

336
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
Twins rays

337
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
Person saying

338
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
James Allen

339
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,823
Bouchard sees twins like the gym

340
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Anythink

341
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,967
In many cases these twins had pretty different environments growing up

342
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,295
So it is identical twins raised separately

343
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Still end up similar

344
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
That is

345
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
Super convincing evidence

346
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
For the influence of genes

347
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:55,679
More than a hundred twins raised apart

348
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,031
And they find DNA does seem to play an important role

349
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
Even for things like Howard

350
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Religious the twins are

351
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
How liberal

352
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
Whether they were attention-seekers

353
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
Assertive Nanny twin studies studies of

354
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,807
Twins raised apart have found results like this

355
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,647
We looked at 1 study that faith we analyzed thousands of

356
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
Twin studies and summarize what those studies suggest

357
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,815
About how important genes are how much they seem to contribute to the differences

358
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,679
DNA seems to be very important on the health of

359
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,007
Specifically Your Eyes Ears Nose Throat skin

360
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
And bones

361
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
For psychiatric health

362
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,871
A little bit less but still Jean seams

363
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
Play a role in about half the variability

364
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,015
And even in things that seem sort of intangible like social values

365
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
Jeans do seem to

366
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
To play a role

367
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,135
Like there was this one big twin study that

368
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Examen rules

369
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,255
We could have Loosely called UIC twin project or twin study

370
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:57,887
This is Larry Baker she is a behavioral genetics expert and a professor of psychology at USC

371
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,751
A longer name might be the risk factors for antisocial Behavior twin study

372
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
I was wondering if

373
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
Official official name and our Publications and then we have the name and our correspondence because we

374
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,575
We didn't want to freak people out I could see it would you like your child to be a part of the risk.

375
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
Address for antisocial

376
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
I have your predict whether your kids are going to become incarcerated or not would you like to participate 1%

377
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,559
Who got a letter inviting her kids to participate

378
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Was

379
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
My mom

380
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
And she said I have some psychopaths in the house

381
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,311
When did the lead researcher on the study that nice ass

382
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Sister and I

383
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
I were a part of

384
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,431
The study with the electric app from the beginning

385
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
After the break

386
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
What that study found

387
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,879
And what modern twin studies have taught us

388
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
About nature

But it can get tricky when you get there and have it

396
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647

00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
What Laura study

403
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
The study that I was

404
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,031
I was looking for was something that they called antisocial Behavior

405
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
So on the far and that's like

406
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Psychopath Behavior

407
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,431
On the floor and they were talking about things like

408
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:52,831
Aggression rule-breaking lying I have a son who is exactly your age at the time we start

409
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,135
The studies so I just thought of all the things that

410
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,951
That he and his friends might done

411
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,767
The researchers looking for all manner of real bacon

412
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Behavior

413
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
And that's why they asked all those questions

414
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
About like

415
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,655
The bricks broken bottles bad about pinching

416
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:10,495
I remember saying no to so many of those questions and feeling like I have to

417
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,567
Just never done anything rebellious or cool

418
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
The electric car

419
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
Anat lab

420
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Natori

421
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,967
That was used to measure our responsiveness

422
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
Too scary or sad sad

423
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
Situations hooked you up

424
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
2

425
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:29,951
A variety of different devices to be able to measure your basically the

426
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,535
The part of your nervous system that's involved in kind of fight or flight

427
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
One theory is that psycho pods or anti

428
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
Asocial individuals are less responsive

429
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,471
Two stimuli and promotions like

430
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Fear and sadness

431
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,079
That is why they had us watch those sad sad movies

432
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
Tipsy how much we react

433
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
It was from the champ

434
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,623
Oh yeah yeah yeah I knew was a Friday something-or-other

435
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,719
Yeah and little Ricky Schroder died with a fighter and his dad

436
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
Dies in a boxing match

437
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,863
And he's sobbing and sobbing it's been used in his studies

438
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,935
Because that is like one of these sadist

439
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:17,823
Phone clips of all time basically if you don't cry at the champ there's something wrong with you Sally did you cry

440
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,455
Brian K confirmed

441
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
That I don't know okay

442
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
Where is the

443
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
Fat Boys

444
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
Who exhibited Psychopathic traits

445
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,207
So kids were more likely to be manipulative or who lied more

446
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,255
Their brains did react

447
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Left stuff like that movie scene

448
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,607
And more broadly the study found that

449
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,215
Jeans do seem to play a large role in antisocial Behavior

450
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,543
And this finding is kind of troubling in a way

451
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,919
It's kind of like what are we going to do with that you know is it going to impact our justice system

452
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:59,295
Is there a possibility that people will get mistreated because they're identified as having a genetic predisposition

453
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,391
And that would be a moral mistake but also a scientific law

454
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,743
Because twin studies have helped us move Way Beyond the idea that genes

455
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
Is Our Fate

456
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
Pretty much any

457
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Sing.

458
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
You seem to have some kind of

459
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
Genetic influence

460
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,447
Is also

461
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Interacting

462
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,287
With other genes and with the environment

463
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:25,919
Like there's a sinner play happening all the time I wasn't cool again the researcher of twin researchers

464
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,479
And almost everyone we spoke with told us

465
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,039
But the question is it nature or nurture

466
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
Is totally outdated

467
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Is obviously

468
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
Both you can't really

469
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,999
Separate out nature from nurture in this really clean way

470
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
Because the whole

471
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
The whole thing

472
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Is

473
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
Dislike Dynamic complex

474
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Text system

475
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Of interaction

476
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,799
There is a lot of work being done right now to tease out and understand these complex interaction

477
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,847
Like one question

478
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
Why is it that sometimes

479
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
People have a gene

480
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
But it doesn't get

481
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Express

482
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,783
There's a whole field that studies that called epigenetic

483
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,319
And also

484
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:09,951
There's a lot of work being done right now to tease out and understand these complex interaction

485
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
Like one question

486
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,071
Why is it that sometimes people have a gene

487
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,095
But it doesn't get it

488
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Expressed

489
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,935
There's a whole field that studies. Called epigenetics

490
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
And also

491
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
The whole genome

492
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Good night

493
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,615
We don't necessarily need twins to help us

494
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Sea jeans

495
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,711
And that let us to wonder very reluctantly

496
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
The science even need twins anymore

497
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
NASCAR about this

498
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:40,159
So are Twin Cities Still Still useful in a world where we can look at

499
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
All the genes

500
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:46,303
Yeah that's an interesting question turns out twin studies are still really useful because you can

501
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,143
You can do things especially to study environment

502
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Because

503
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:56,543
Identical twins for all of our identical genomes we can still live extremely different life

504
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,591
Like my identical twin sister and I

505
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,151
I am right handed she is left

506
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
She's queer I'm straight

507
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,271
For radio I spent years in Corporate America

508
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
She is an artist

509
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
By looking at twins like us

510
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,671
Researchers can start to zoom in on

511
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
What aspects of the environment

512
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,511
Mattermost to have differently

513
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Turn out

514
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Back in Colton

515
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,679
Jeanswear this invisible thing that twins allowed us to

516
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,239
The mystery twins could help solve

517
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,847
There's a lot of invisible stuff in the environment

518
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,151
To we think about jeans lot but

519
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
Well we really know nothing about is the environment

520
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
It's the error term it's

521
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,367
Anything that's not genetic is the environment but like

522
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
What is that mean

523
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
Right we're so

524
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,535
Busy trying to sequence the genome but lie

525
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,887
We need to if this is the real question nature what's nature what's nurture

526
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,447
If the sequence of environment to

527
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Don't worry science twins

528
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,775
We're on the job we got this

529
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,895

Good or bad we are here for it all or show today was produced by Darian woods and Nick fountain or supervising producer

536
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Is Alex goldmark Bryant AR status

537
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,568
Show special thanks to Nancy Siegel and Jay Joseph

538
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,712
Also our NPR colleague at Hidden brain did a great episode about Twin Cities check that out they do great work

539
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:46,112
And our friends over at Radiolab just finished an amazing series on intelligence which goes beep on some

540
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,184
Some of these questions about genetic research that we touched on here

541
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,488
If you like this episode you will like that

542
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:58,400
We cannot sign off today without saying this is our very last week with the great Sally home and we are so sad

543
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,800
So you've been such a star here at Planet Money and we are going to miss you so much I'm going to miss you guys

544
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
Around you hear me on the airwaves soon Goodwin's

545
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
I am Karen Duffin and I'm finally home this is NPR thanks for listening

546
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
Marie would you like to

547
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,816
To tell the story of when we switched places it worked out really well for me but

548
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,888
How much for caring because

549
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,192
It was a sixth-grade yes

550
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
Weirdest substitute

551
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,288
And I was a little bit of a troublemaker or is

552
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,360
Karen was the angel she is today

553
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,408
And of course during the course of the

554
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
Class I got in trouble so I got

555
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:49,088
My name on the board with check marks except my name that day with Karen Karen got check marks

556
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
And check marks work

557
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,160
Oh yeah that was that meant attention
