00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04,608
Everybody's David we are replaying one of our favorite episodes today this story is about

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,632
I'm not going to

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,448
Larry Williams has a lot of stuff

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,752
There was a quest to find Noah's Ark

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,896
Find it where's the time he ran for US Senate in Montana didn't win but he got 44% of the vote

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,688
And then there's the one we're going to tell you today

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,736
It starts in 1986

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,576
Larry and some of his buddies are up in New Mexico is Caballo Mountain

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,624
Hanging out in the sagebrush

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
Camping tents

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,952
And then one night he said they're all sitting on the couch

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,560
We started talking as guys do talk about a campfire about a lot of things

13
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:39,680
And nobody really enjoys paying taxes that's not surprising

14
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,728
The question came up the question

15
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,032
Do you really have to pay your income

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,640
Larry it heard about these people who had found legal ways not to pay at all

17
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:52,224
As It Happened One of the men sitting around that campfire was a lawyer

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,248
A man named Jim Knowles

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,064
I asked the gym about

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
Jim cigars

21
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,160
Now so I'll BSS you know you got to pay your taxes

22
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,208
Call your lawyer look into it

23
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,000
The lawyer Jim wasn't respectable

24
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,792
Active in his community in

25
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
Church total stretch

26
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
And he says

27
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
Sure

28
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
I will look into

29
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,448
Larry didn't hear anything for a while

30
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
Then one day he gets this call

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
It's Jim the lawyer

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
Sing

33
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
Can I come by and talk to you

34
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,128
Mary says sure

35
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:24,224
Jim comes by and explains he's pretty sure he's found a hole in the tax laws

36
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,552
A hole so big that Larry and whoever else wanted to

37
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
Could just walk right through

38
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
When he told you that did you think

39
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
Maybe I don't have to pay income tax

40
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,024
Yeah of course I did I'm here as a lawyer Hastings law school lawyer

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,864
And I got a lawyer for 45 years or so

42
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:46,240
Representable guy yeah and that's how Larry Williams decided to stop paying is it

43
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:51,104
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Keith Romer and I'm David kestenbaum

44
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
Nobody likes painter income taxes

45
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
We all take as many deductions

46
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:01,088
Some of us go further you know round down maybe leave a few things out and then there are people like Larry Wood

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,440
You took this very understandable impulse to pay as little as possible

48
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,232
And went just as far as you

49
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
You could go

50
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
Decided he wasn't going to pay

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,376
Today on the show The Story of Larry Williams

52
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
And an answer to the question

53
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
Do you really have to pay your income tax

54
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,824
This message comes from NPR sponsor Capital One

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,872

Capital One na

60
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
When Larry Williams

61
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
Decided to stop paying it

62
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
He was working as a Commodities Trader and a

63
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
Investment advisor give

64
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Tok

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
He's making a really good living

66
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
You could certainly afford

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,472
Taxes that of course pay for all kinds of things people want to have in some form

68
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
The military

69
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Court system

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
Rhodes wrestler about that

71
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
Don't you like roads

72
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,920
He said well you could pay for roads

73
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
And the other stuff

74
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
He said we just shouldn't be spending so much money on

75
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,344
Larry feels like people pay way too much in tax

76
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
Sales tax

77
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Sac City tax state

78
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
Tax property tax

79
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,720
And then on top of all of that

80
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Federal income tax

81
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,400
When somebody comes and takes 50% of my income doesn't have the courtesy to point a gun at me to do it

82
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,680
It's bothersome

83
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
Some people apparently doesn't bother okay they were all over and they could b**** and moan about it but they don't do anything about it

84
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
Larry

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
He was going to do something about it

86
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:35,296
Not only was he not going to pay he was going to use the tax lot itself to prove that what he was doing was 104

87
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,112
Percent legal Larry's lawyer laid out the loophole

88
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
It went back to the

89
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,744
There is no mention of an income tax in the original tax

90
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
In the Sixteenth Amendment ratified in 1930

91
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
The 16th Amendment is very short

92
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
And on the surface it seems pretty clear

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
This is how it starts

94
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,800
The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes

95
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,592
From whatever Source derived

96
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
Does that seem like you have a lot of wiggle room

97
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,712
Larry and his lawyer we're taking a close look at that

98
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
What exactly they are

99
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
Did income mean

100
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
Like what is the legal definition

101
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,880
What count is

102
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,232
His lawyer friend Jim had gone back and pulled all these old Court

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,536
Aldi's old decisions instead

104
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
You know

105
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,423
There's a pretty good legal argument you can make that the federal income tax can only be applied

106
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Federal income

107
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,031
Like Money Paid you by the federal government

108
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
If you have a government job or some

109
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,639
Call the Internal Revenue Service

110
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:39,039
So think about that for Mama internal internal door what if you have an internal investigation say at the police station it's about

111
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,135
About police officers is so internal would be income generated

112
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:48,767
From a federal based Revenue so if you're paid by the government that would be internal to United States

113
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
If your income has

114
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,863
Not from the United States government

115
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Venice

116
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
Not taxable

117
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,239
His lawyer friend also questioned who was legally required to

118
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Pay this income

119
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
Sure citizens the United States

120
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
But according to his reading of the Constitution

121
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,175
US citizenship was basically option

122
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
Your citizenship

123
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
Isn't quite what you and I

124
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Normally

125
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
Think your citizenship is

126
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
Larry thought about all this

127
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
And where most people would decide

128
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,231
No way that's crazy I could end up in prison

129
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
Larry thought

130
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Let's give it a try

131
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
What are some party that was like

132
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
If this is legal why isn't every single America

133
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
Well that's a question people always ask but this time you know because a lot of people don't study a lot of people are afraid of the government

134
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,663
Why do people just roll over they don't want to test anything

135
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,271
The knot on the edge of always like living on the edge life of Congress more interesting out there so

136
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,111
To me it was like okay this is interesting let's see where this leads

137
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,159
So you felt like you were testing the government

138
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:53,791
It away sure absolutely that weekend we didn't hide anything with her we are this what we're doing

139
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
We filed the papers

140
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Here's what they do

141
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,423
Since by his lawyers Logic the income tax you only apply to citizens

142
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
Of the United States

143
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,263
Larry wrote a letter to the state of California

144
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Declaring that he was a quote

145
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
Sovereign citizen

146
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
The state of KY

147
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:12,479
And to make it doubly clear that his personal income wasn't taxable by the federal government

148
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
Larry set up something called

149
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Pure Trust

150
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Andy Roddick

151
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,623
All of his income into that trust

152
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,439
Now it wasn't as personal income anymore

153
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:27,839
Now the income belong to that Trust Bank of America open up a bank account for the trust you know we got.

154
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
Attack

155
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,703
Identification numbers and all that stuff

156
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
To basically paid almost no income tax

157
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Correct

158
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,591
So after you file that are you

159
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,431
Are you nervous that someone's going to come after you like how does it feel after you file

160
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,527
Why would I be nervous I had to buy some to to CPA

161
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
And a couple lawyers

162
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,391
We thought at this point we should probably check with 8/3 wire

163
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,487
My name is Dan Evans I'm a lawyer

164
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
Do you unlike biographical details

165
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,399
Dennis spent a lot of time studying this tax fraud

166
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,751
You got interested in it because there was this whole world of people asking these questions

167
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
Or at least there was a Tuesday

168
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,127
HughesNet was this popular thing back in the early days of the internet

169
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,223
It was basically message boards where people can post questions or discuss things they were in

170
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,527
And there are a couple of them on taxes

171
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,599
There was a miscellaneous Top Texas moderated

172
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
Which

173
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,231
The messages had to be approved by a moderator and that kind of kind of kept the crazies out

174
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
But miscellaneous. Taxes was wide open

175
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:35,423
And I hadn't been there very long before someone posted something very emphatic very certain

176
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
About how the income tax was unconstitutional

177
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,287
And he cited cases

178
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
And the Bruce Haber decision and

179
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
I read it I thought

180
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
You know

181
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
I don't remember that from Law School

182
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
Then look into a bunch of these claims

183
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
Some seemed totally ridiculous like this one that Ohio had never officially filed the paperwork to become

184
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
I'm a state

185
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
What does that has to do with anything

186
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,279
Well that's a good question Taff was born in

187
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Ohio

188
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
And if Ohio was an estate and then he shouldn't have been praising the United States and he could not have ratified the 16th of May

189
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Amendment or something

190
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
The 16th Amendment which provided for the income

191
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:18,431
Another claim is that if you write these three Latin words on your tax form nunc Pro tunc

192
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
You don't have to pay

193
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
Not true by the way

194
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
They were ones that were obviously crazy

195
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
But then they were ones that took some digging

196
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,695
Dance Arts writing up everything he find online in an FAQ

197
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
Frequently asked questions

198
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Those are Made Back Then

199
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,071
Dances called the tax protester FAQ

200
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,655
So I pulled it up online

201
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,495
I thought I'll just print this out so we can have in the studio and the printer

202
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:48,639
Went freaking insane like I thought it was just like a couple Pages there was trying to put out 289 pages

203
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
Had actually unplug the printer

204
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:55,039
Sorry about that I guess I should have printed a warning up top like do not try to print

205
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:00,927
Can you boil all these hundreds of pages down to a sentence is there anything to any of these arguments

206
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
No

207
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:09,119
Dan says it if Larry Williams had come to him and said I'm thinking about not paying my taxes

208
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
You would have said no way

209
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,983
But Larry had other lawyer telling him differ

210
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,311
So he filed a sovereign citizenship and he formed is pure

211
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Your trust

212
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
And he didn't pay his income tax

213
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
You know what happened

214
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
Nothing happened

215
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
Internet for how long did nothing have

216
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,319
Hello maybe 3-4 years

217
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,647
The three four years you go on paying basically no income tax

218
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Yeah

219
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
My basically not how did that feel

220
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
Why would it feel bad

221
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
My money

222
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
Years went by and nothing

223
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Maybe she was onto something

224
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,263
Maybe the IRS did not have a good answer to his legal claim

225
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,431
Or maybe the IRS just hadn't gotten around to dealing with it yet

226
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,647
This message comes from NPR sponsor Capital One Capital One is reimagining banking I offering account

227
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:08,767

00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
What's in your wallet

229
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
Capital One na

230
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,727
We reached out to the IRS they declined to comment on Larry's case but you can imagine thing from their side

231
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
Maybe the first year Larry doesn't file his taxes they don't notice

232
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,639
There's a lot of people filing taxes he just one return among Millions

233
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
But then he does it the next year

234
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
And the year after that

235
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
If you the IRS your like

236
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Waze

237
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
I see what's going on here

238
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
Dear Larry William

239
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:41,279
Then the IRS starts writing letters in a course gym would write letters back to their letters

240
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:46,143
If that's not a problem and then the battle really began

241
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,495
The IRS started taking money out of his bank account legal arguments back in

242
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Henceforth

243
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,847
His lawyer Jim sang Don't worry don't worry we got this

244
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
And then Jim died

245
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Out of the blue

246
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
You know how people feel lost

247
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
When a friend dies

248
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Liefeld

249
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
He also was legally lost

250
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
And I'm on my own here aren't I

251
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,975
Larry didn't know what to do

252
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,375
He wasn't a lawyer he tried keeping up with all the letters back and forth to the IRS but he really didn't know the law

253
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,727
At some point Larry decides to make a trip to Australia to give a series of talks about

254
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Plane lands at 2

255
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
And he's sitting there waiting to get off

256
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
When these three guys

257
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
Get on the plane and walk down the aisle

258
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
They stopped at his seat

259
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
Are you Larry Williams

260
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
Well I got love

261
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
What is this for

262
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
Maybe they wouldn't anime said you're under arrest

263
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Okay

264
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
NYSEG Buffalo

265
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,999
To this romantic for I went down in the basement of us

266
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
Airport Econo car like a holding area

267
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,911
And went there and they said I hear the papers in United States government

268
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,215
You been charged with income tax evasion

269
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,031
The Australian police had arrested Larry on behalf of the

270
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,615
They take Larry down to a jail in down

271
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
Where he meets his self

272
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,735
He's a guy with a scar and aside from a bullet wound

273
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
Larry tells him I'm in for tax evasion

274
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
Summit says

275
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
I'm in for robbing bank

276
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
There's like

277
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,183
I never met a bank robber for my life

278
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
Flight to Hawaii rob a bank

279
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
Guy says he's how I do it

280
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,327
The trick to robbing bank first of all you need three people

281
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,983
You need one guy to drive a car one guy to maintain the door control traffic coming in out and one guy me I'm the

282
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,311
Iranian I am Square I jump over there

283
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,383
The counter a grab all the money and run out

284
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:39,295
You got to do it in 2 and 1/2 minutes if you don't have it in 2 and 1/2 minutes got to leave cuz that's how the coppers response time is by

285
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
About three and a half minutes

286
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
Lie gets out on bail after

287
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,975
U.s. government is trying to extradite him so they can actually get him into a quart

288
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
But lies like I'm not done yet

289
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
Here's a local lawyer to help him fight extra

290
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,191
If your the IRS Larry is an enormous pain

291
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
Because he's that little guy

292
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,591
But he's costing so much money to try to bring back to the country

293
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,919
Still the law is the law and you can just let him get away with it

294
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
For three years Larry does get away with

295
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
He lives in Australia

296
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
Is fiance flies down

297
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
See the sights.

298
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
Kangaroos

299
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Dive the Great Barrier Reef

300
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
But at some point

301
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
It all starts to feel

302
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
Larry says fine

303
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
I will come home

304
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
Let the courts decide

305
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
What's it like to be extradited

306
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Not fun

307
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,495
Two Marshals Shackled In Me said they paraded him

308
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
Through the airport then sat next to him on the plane all the way

309
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
Something like 15 years after Larry first stopped

310
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Paying taxes

311
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
US Government finally got him in

312
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Front of a judge

313
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:46,623
I was charged with the income tax evasion fraud multiple bank accounts all sorts of really bad things

314
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,207
Unidad defraud the government but I was a really bad guy

315
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,303
To give you a sense of what Larry was up against from a legal perspective

316
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,887
We ran Larry's old arguments passed the lawyer from before Dan Evans

317
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
They're all in his 300 page essay

318
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,495
First we asked about the pure Trust

319
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
Larry's routing all his income

320
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Dermatrest

321
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
I don't know where to start I mean it's

322
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:11,455
I hate to tell you this but what you are talking about is pure gibberish

323
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
It is nonsense

324
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
It is ridiculous

325
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,879
Well let's start by looking at subchapter J of the Internal Revenue code which refers to trust

326
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
What's dangos on for a little while.

327
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,279
Then we tried the one about Larry being a sovereign citizen of the State of California

328
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:30,911
It doesn't make any difference whether you're citizen of the United States if you are within the physical boundaries of the United States

329
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
You have to pay federal income tax

330
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Even Larry had seen the writing on the wall

331
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,847
Before he even appeared in court he agreed to pay all the back tax

332
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
The IRS said that

333
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
The question before the judge and jury

334
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,527
Was whether Larry should go to jail or pay huge fine for what he had done

335
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
Here we got copies of the trance

336
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,695
The prosecutors go first they lay out that Larry had not been paying taxes they point out

337
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,279
Adding onto fancy homes they show these checks he'd received for like

338
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,607
$100,000 $150,000 for all invest

339
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
MIT lectures

340
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,007
The prosecutor tell the jury this case is about greed lies deception and fraud ladies and gentlemen

341
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,079
But then Larry's defense lawyer starts making his case

342
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
And this part is fast

343
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
He said

344
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,711
You've heard the statement ignorance of the law is no excuse

345
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
That is the general rule

346
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,319
You can't Bop somebody on the head or kill them and say I didn't know

347
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,391
But because we are dealing with a special area

348
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
Complicated

349
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
Local tax laws

350
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
In tax cases

351
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,303
If a defendant believes that what he's doing is not against the law

352
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
Even if his belief is crazy

353
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,167
I will say that again even if his belief is crazy

354
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
If you believe that in good faith

355
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
He is not guilty of

356
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
The crime of tax

357
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:45,919
I love that you can literally say I didn't know what the rules are and that can get you off our tax laws are that concert

358
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,759
It makes it really hard for the IRS to prosecute criminal cases of

359
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Against tax protest

360
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
Just Like Larry

361
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
Even if the arguments are totally

362
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,207
Larry's attorney keeps going and remember this is his attorney talking about

363
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,791
He says and now I will say something that I've been saying for many months

364
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
Larry Williams

365
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Wisecrack

366
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Not crazy in the sense

367
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:11,519
That he was insane but crazy in the sense that he believed things that were simply wrong about the meaning of the

368
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:17,407
The code about the application of the tax laws about how words are defined and what words mean in the internal revenue

369
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Avenue code

370
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
Which counts as a legitimate defense

371
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
Because of the statute of limitations

372
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,855
Larry was only on trial for three years of not paying.

373
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,207
Larry's lawyer went on to point out that while Larry had made a lot of money in those ears

374
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
He also lost a lot

375
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:35,583
One thing it turned out his secretary had been embezzling money from him on top of that

376
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
Larry lost over $1000000 to not one but

377
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
To investment scams

378
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
And a Ponzi scheme

379
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,543
My wallet I was allowed to write all those losses off

380
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Honest taxes

381
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,383
His lawyer said at the end of the day he didn't actually have much income

382
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,527
In the end after 3 days of trial the prosecutors offered Larry a plea deal

383
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
Which Larry took

384
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,159
Larry agreed to plead guilty to three misdemeanors and pay a $50,000 fine

385
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,999
We should point out that that is just for the crime of failing to pay his taxes

386
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
For the trial started Lariat Rd

387
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,863
Pay the back taxes for all the years not covered by the trial

388
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
And that amounts to $600,000

389
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Text Winnie I didn't file

390
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,543
Still after years of flouting the law Larry Williams left the courtroom that day

391
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
A free man

392
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,639
Oh my gosh she don't know how good that felt

393
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,967
Larry says the experience change that we thought about tax

394
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,295
I understand that the tax protest argument

395
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
Is wrong

396
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,743
Or if it's correct it isn't going to be validated any court of law so it doesn't matter to losing battle

397
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
So you got to

398
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
Buckle up to the barn

399
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
Pay your taxes

400
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
Do you feel any guilt

401
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,495
I don't understand the question

402
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,335
That that you should have been paying

403
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,663
I did pay I pay a lot of money in taxes

404
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
It's true he did

405
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Eventually

406
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,575
The US system for collecting income tax a lot of it is based on

407
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,647
Well people think of the IRS watching our every move

408
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
The truth is the IRS only has the resources

409
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
Tiny tiny fraction of all the

410
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,375
The whole system is based on what sometimes called voluntary

411
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,447
Which means it is up to each person to figure out

412
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
What tax rules apply to them

413
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
And calculate how much they're supposed

414
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
One consequence of that

415
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
It's People Like Larry

416
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,967
Will dig through our super complicated tax code and all these old court cases

417
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,807
Looking for any argument that will let them legally not pay their income

418
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,367
Especially because of the whole thing ends up in court

419
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
You can just say

420
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
I didn't know

421
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:41,279
Eventually the IRS got so fed up with hearing all these terrible arguments

422
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,839
That they made a list of them and put them up on their website

423
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
When I checked this morning they were 44 of them

424
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,215
It's actually no illegal to use any one of these arguments in

425
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
Frivolous argue

426
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,847
And if you try to use one you can get fined $25,000

427
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,247
Frivolous by the way is an actual legal term someone explain to me that it's a judge's way of saying basically

428
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
You're drunk

429
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,831
Go home and sober up I'm not talking to you right now

430
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,135
Larry Williams is finally paying his

431
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,999
He is moved to the US Virgin Islands in part he says for tax reasons

432
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
You get a lot of tax break

433
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
And

434
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:21,471
