1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:01,792
A couple of weeks ago

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,560
Something

3
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:08,192
Very very strange happened in one of the most anticipated college basketball games

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,496
This is North Carolina versus

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,776
Duke archrival

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:12,800
Top 10

7
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,384
And Duke has a player named Zion Williamson who

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
Is probably the single most amazing college player I have ever seen

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
So we're 30 seconds into the game

10
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832
Williamson has the ball

11
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:31,232
Driving spinning Zion Williamson

12
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,024
And as the announcers

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
Watching the replay of the

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840
They start to realize

15
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
Did Zion Williamson

16
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,656
Fell and got hurt

17
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,704
Because his Nike shoe

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
Head split open

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
Like

20
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,776
The soldiers

21
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,592
Ripped away from the fabric and he slid to the floor

22
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:50,176
That's unbelievable you broke your shoe with his own foot

23
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,480
Zion Williamson sat out for the rest

24
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
With Annie in

25
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,552
Apparently because

26
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Is Nike

27
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,600
Basketball shoe

28
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,624
Head blown out

29
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,160
The next day

30
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
Nike stock drop

31
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,024
Nike itself had to issue a statement saying this with quote

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,816
An isolated incident

33
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,376
But that the company would launch an investigation

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,448
And isn't watching all of this unfold

35
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,008
My first thought is of course about Zion Williamson

36
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
Luckily it looks like he

37
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Define

38
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
But my second thought

39
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
Was holy crap

40
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,016
We did an entire episode that we never thought would be relevant

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
But suddenly

42
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
It was

43
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,672
So today we are going to replay that at

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
The story of

45
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
The last time

46
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,560
There was a major investigation into

47
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,608
And a national obsession with

48
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
The quality

49
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
A basketball City

50
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824

51
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,664
Data package

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Jeffy.

53
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Adidas sneakers

54
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01,856
Starz series

55
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
Hey there

Yeah they're like Spider-Man

58
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,864
They're not sweating

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
Danny

60
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
Okay that's probably sweat

61
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:23,360
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,968
And those sweaty eBay sneakers

64
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,272
That I'm wearing on my feet right now as I speak

65
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,856
They are one of the most extraordinary experiments

66
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
Basketball sneaker history

67
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,304
Today on the show we know that you can put a famous basketball players name on a pair of shoes and charge more money

68
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,448
But what happens when you put an NBA All-Stars name on a pair of shoes and charge less

69
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,568
Much much less but like

70
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,640
Okay don't wear any worse.

The Man Behind the sneakers that I'm wearing

81
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
Is an NBA All-Star named Stephen

82
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Marbury

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
And he grew up during the basketball sneaker Revolution

84
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,552
You got your mom and you

85
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
You say I'm playing basketball I need

86
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,672
These sneakers

87
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
Important distinction here of course

88
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Especially with my mother

89
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,864
Gwen Stefani was born in 1977 basketball shoes were essentially

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
Does a piece of sports equipment like knee pads for your feet

91
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,288
The most iconic brand for decades was a shoe called the Chuck Taylor All Star

92
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,872
Their basic affordable Shoes Canvas rubber nothing fancy

93
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
But what's the fun with 8 years old

94
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
The sneaker game

95
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Change

96
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,624
In 1985 Nike release this commercial is Michael Jordan

97
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
Soaring in slow motion through the air

98
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,863
Air Jordan with the first Air Jordan sneaker and it was beautiful

99
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,703
Look like a sports car white and black leather with streaks of red

100
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,079
Stores couldn't keep these things in stock people were wearing them as shoes not just as basketball shoes

101
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
And they cost a lot

102
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,687
The Air Jordan 1 retail for $65

103
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,991
150 bucks in 2 days

104
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:44,159
And then the next year 1986 Air Jordan The Jordan 2 came out is all of the imaginary

105
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,231
Those hot even more $100

106
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
The Jordan 4s

107
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Cost a hundred

108
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,607
10 to Jordan 5 cost $125

109
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,911
Stefan was 13 years old

110
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
When is Jordan 5s

111
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,007
I was living in Coney Island Brooklyn one of seven kids

112
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
His family didn't have a lot

113
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
And so

114
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
When Stefan asked his mom

115
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
For those shoes

116
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
She was not having it

117
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:10,527
I mean my mother asked my mother for a pair of shoes at that price the reply was

118
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,343
Boy those are groceries for the month

119
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,903
Why am I going to go spend that type of money

120
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
4

121
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
A pair of shoes

122
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
And you would say what cuz everybody else got them

123
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,119
Oh yeah you're not going to be the one that's going to have a pair

124
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,703
But it wasn't because she didn't want to buy them if it

125
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Just because she couldn't

126
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,799
Stefan says this planted a seed

127
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
He always wondered when there be another option here

128
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,735
Is a famous players basketball shoe always have to be so expensive

129
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
Know a lot of kids might

130
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Think this

131
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
But

132
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,855
Stephan got to do something about it

133
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Because

134
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,927
I grew up you got very good at basketball

135
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,999
In 1996 he was drafted into the NBA

136
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
The Milwaukee Bucks

137
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Select

138
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,263
Stephon Marbury the camera cuts to the whole Marberry family they are freaking out

139
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,663
Stephon Marbury is Banning by now it's brexit

140
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
This moment right here

141
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
That makes me love Stephon Marbury

142
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,087
Because on the first question was totally just sounds like an ice breaker

143
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
She just starts

144
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
I can't even

145
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,839
20 loan

146
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,711
The camera Cuts backstage and now Stefan's mother is dancing

147
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,551
Is this girl so good I could put a smile on my mother face

148
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
Define join the NBA

149
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
Became an NBA All-Star

150
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Twice

151
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,767
And year after year famous player after famous player

152
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,351
Signed endorsement deals to sell shoes at ridiculously high

153
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,703
Stefan doesn't remember the exact moment but an idea started

154
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
And you can think of it this way

155
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
Sneaker is made up of foam and rubber and leather

156
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
By attaching a famous basketball players name

157
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
Can you get to charge more

158
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
And kids go crazy for

159
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
Could you use an endorsement

160
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
To do the exact opposite

161
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,367
Topeka same shoe of foam and rubber and leather

162
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
And attach a famous basketball players name

163
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
But charged

164
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Less

165
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
And still have it

166
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,279
Be cool still get the kind of buzz

167
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
The Air Jordan

168
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
Stephan wanted to know

169
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,167
Could I make affordable sneakers

170
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Cool

171
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,567
I can see my mom I can see my mom being able to do something for all of her kids

172
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
Does that is that who you

173
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Picture winners

174
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Of course

175
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,527
In 2005 after he been in the NBA for almost a decade

176
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
The phone finally met someone

177
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
You could help him make this

178
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
A guy named Howard Shack

179
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
Is always talked about there has to be a dick

180
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Well

181
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
We were the different way

182
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
Howard works for a clothing company called

183
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,167
Steve & Barry's founded by a pair of long Islanders named Steve

184
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
Amberry

185
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,567
It was a relatively unknown chain that sold clothes at ridiculously low price

186
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
And they said they were able to do this

187
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
A couple of

188
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,431
For one they cut out the middleman

189
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,247
Manufacture Their Own Line of clothes in China

190
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,551
They took the smallest markup

191
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
But they could possibly

192
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Afford

193
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,391
They basically had no advertising

194
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Budget

195
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,743
And then they open stores in struggling malls where they would ask for

196
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Discount

197
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Free space

198
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
This was a business

199
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
But now

200
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
Steve & Barry's

201
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
Wanted to get in

202
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
2B Athletics

203
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,775
Howard personally had a vision for cheap basketball shoes

204
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,847
And he wanted to have a famous basketball player

205
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,175
People who told him that Stephon Marbury

206
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
Happened to be a famous basketball player

207
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Looking

208
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
To make shoes cheaper

209
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,879
There was just like a light bulb went off and they said you know staff

210
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
Could be the perfect

211
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Athlete

212
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,511
So where gets the stuff on that Steve & Barry's would like to me

213
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
And his first thought

214
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
Who and who

215
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,519
I didn't know I mean I learned of them before the meeting and I was like this is you know I got to see this for myself

216
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
Stephon took this meeting

217
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,383
And he remember Steven berries laying out their vision for the sneak

218
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
They're going to call at the star bear

219
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
That's been Stefan's nicknames in high school

220
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
And they have brought some prototype

221
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,343
Plus some clothes that would be part of the star berryline

222
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
They start showing me and you know

223
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,719
Stuff that we're making the quality is really good that is

224
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,047
I'm saying OK Google how much is all of that how much

225
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
It's like $15

226
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,423
You're going to make all of that stuff in $15

227
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
Damn

228
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
And then he

229
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
No we're going to sell all this stuff

230
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,847
All the stuff you see is going to be $15 or less

231
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
I said

232
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
T okay

233
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Like I

234
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
And it was like no serious

235
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
For real

236
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
And I was like

237
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:03,135
Are you telling me you can make all of these different things and you can sell everything under $15

238
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
Let's do this deal

239
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Another art

240
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
2 ways to think about Indore

241
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,119
The obvious one is that

242
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:19,263
You want to go out and find the most famous the biggest like the best person and attach them to your product

243
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
At this point in his

244
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,615
Career Stephon Marbury wasn't really any of those

245
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,735
But the other way of thinking of endorsements is it if you have the right product

246
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
In the right person

247
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
In a story is

248
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Perfect

249
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,903
Then maybe you don't have to be the most famous person in the world

250
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,231
So yeah there's a place for the Air Jordan where you have the most

251
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,559
Famous basketball player matched up with the most expensive most

252
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Shoe

253
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
But maybe there's also a place for the star berry

254
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
Where you have

255
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
Ellesse famous basketball player

256
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
Who has a great story about how he couldn't afford those shoes

257
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
But now

258
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,383
He's matched up with a $15

259
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
On August 17th

260
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
2006

261
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
The shoe drop

262
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
The strawberry one went on sale

263
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
Exclusively

264
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
@stephen

265
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,511
Another basketball star is lending his name to a new sneaker unveils his line of high tops

266
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,911
At a low cost his starbury one basketball shoes that cost $14.98

267
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,471
Affordable for low-income families

268
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
The story was everywhere

269
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
And so is Stefan

270
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Showing off

271
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,223
Strawberry one is a mostly white shoe it has dark veins and blue cutting across the upper that's the

272
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,271
The part that goes over the top of your foot

273
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,599
The sole of the shoe was New York Knicks orange the Team Stefan

274
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
Playing for time

275
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
People seemed

276
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
Excited to see it

277
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
But

278
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Over and over

279
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
Same question

280
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
One question I might ask is

281
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:52,959
Are you cutting Corners at the production and cuz that's a sensitive issue everybody thought

282
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
If this cost $15

283
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
It cannot possibly

284
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Be a good bass

285
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:04,735
I'm Good Morning America Diane Sawyer was worried about the bottom of the shoe

286
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:11,135
Basketball in here Jimmy Kimmel show a picture of Stephan holding up a shoe that look like someone had pulled it out of it.

287
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,279
But what do you want their $15 it was a price signaling

288
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Problem

289
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,655
In the marketing and Retail World prices communicate so much information

290
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
Especially

291
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
In an aspirational market like athletic

292
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,591
So when you go out and you buy a new golf club for a little bit more money you're hoping

293
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,455
But that is going to buy you performance like maybe your drive will be 10 yards longer

294
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,831
And so pricing the star berry at $14.98

295
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,159
Had unintentionally signals that this sneaker

296
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Is crap

297
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:51,071
The Fancy Shoes are ten times more money does that mean that they are 10 times better does that mean

298
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,119
That the star berry is 10 *

299
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Worse

300
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
See Premier the shoe

301
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
I forgot to

302
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Before we talked

303
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
I went on eBay

304
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
The price signaling problem

305
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
Dominated the starburys Khan

306
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
And what's the phone kept saying was

307
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,039
If people would just try these things out they would see that these are not 10 times

308
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
These shoes are 10 years old my bodies on eBay

309
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
They're my size

310
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
I'mma put you through the wringer man

311
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
I'm a play

312
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Play games on it

313
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,559
Try to run a half marathon time prediction is that they're going to hold up

314
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
You going to run a half marathon

315
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
Try try having

316
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,191
I haven't trained for it you good

317
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,007
Okay on the good baby go for it

318
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Go for it

319
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
She's kind of heavy don't breathe well but

320
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:44,831
Not the problem I am the problem 6 - 6.55

321
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
I did a half of a half an hour

322
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,463
Terrible idea she was hella fine

323
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,791
They also actually held up really well running and cutting on a basketball court

324
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:59,167
But listen these are not the exact same as $150 pair of

325
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,471
Many of the differences are just cosmetic

326
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,031
It looks very simple the laces aren't fancy

327
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
And I suspect the leather upper

328
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
Is actually pleather although I've never gotten

329
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
A straight answer on that

330
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,247
But there are things that seem more important like there's no match for breathing there's no air bubble in the

331
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
Nikhil

332
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
That said

333
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
It is way closer to an expensive shoe than I expect

334
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
And so when the shoe came out

335
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,255
The goal was to get people to try it and have the same experience I had

336
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,071
Stefan went on interview after interview

337
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
Trying to convince people just give it a chance

338
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
My favorite way that's dafont

339
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Did this

340
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
Was he tried

341
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
I tried so hard

342
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
To just get someone to take a star berry

343
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
Had to take an expensive shoe

344
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
How to do an analysis

345
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
By chopping them both

346
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,759
If you take a $200 shoe and you take my shoe and you cut both of the shoes down

347
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:51,903
Got a motor with a chainsaw over and over

348
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
Cut both of them down the middle

349
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,511
And then finally someone actually took Stephan up on

350
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,327
Cut it down a half to do the same exact thing

351
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Really

352
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,703
It was John Stossel on 20/20 actually took a pair of Jordans and a pair of starburys

353
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Sneaker

354
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
Expert so we cut both shoes up

355
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
And he and others In The Biz

356
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
Concluded are constructed the same way

357
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,711
Are the Air Jordans do have this thing that looks like an air vent but

358
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
It's closed

359
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,367
I actually talked to the guy who is in charge of Designing Air Jordans at the time a sneaker Legend

360
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
Name Dewayne Edward

361
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:28,255
Oh yeah we bought a pair just to see cuz we were curious to like how they pull this off

362
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,839
Auntie Wayne said Yeah we actually chopped a pair of them open to

363
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
It was about the bare minimum you need to build a basketball shoe

364
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
He wouldn't go play in it

365
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
But that said

366
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
Is it better

367
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
Then you would expect a $15 sneaker

368
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
It was

369
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,151
It was honestly actually

370
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,711
People cutting a shoe open grate

371
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
But Howard Schecter from Steven berries

372
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
Says that both he and Stefan new

373
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
There's really only one

374
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
Test but ultimately

375
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,951
Can an NBA player

376
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
Where these $15 shoes

377
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
In a real

378
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
NBA game

379
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,143
It is very easy to record $50 anything

380
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Thank ya

381
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
But if an NBA player

382
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
Kenan Trust

383
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
Their body

384
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Tibby's

385
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
It's got to be good enough

386
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
It's got to be good

387
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
The shoe launched in the summer during the autopsy

388
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
People had months

389
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
To speculate

390
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,015
About whether the shoe could hold up or not

391
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
And then on November 1st

392
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
2006

393
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
The day arrived

394
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
First game of the season

395
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
New York Knicks

396
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
Versus the Memphis Grizzlies

397
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,351
They're Stefan wearing the black version of the starberry the version he wore for away game

398
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
Howard sheckter remembers watching this

399
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,007
Enormous Pride every time they showed up and you saw that logo

400
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
We

401
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,847
Chilitos little company nobody ever heard of

402
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:53,503
We we made it we got this NBA star is wearing the sneaker we thought about on

403
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
Concord

404
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
The game was going great it was

405
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
What's the third quarter Stefan and the Knicks

406
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
We're leaving by 9

407
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
And then all of a sudden

408
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,095
I think staff tripped or something

409
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Imma

410
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:14,751
I'm thinking it better not been the shoe whenever he's playing in those reduced

411
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
Price shoes

412
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
But the wind is knocked out of me

413
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
God forbid

414
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
The shoe ripped on court

415
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,295
Or it didn't hold the traction any any slipped in tours near something

416
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
You know it's done

417
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:34,463
Define goes over to the bench the game goes on without him and somebody rushes over to look at his foot

418
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
And everyone is like oh my god let's hope it wasn't the shoes fault like let like talking about

419
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
Probably Define was totally fine

420
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
And he got a kick in the shin or something

421
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,287
Came back into the game and honestly he doesn't even remember it

422
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,591
You know this is part of basketball

423
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:56,735
When the next game came Stefan for the $15 shoe again

424
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
And then the next game

425
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
And the next game

426
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,855
For the entire season Stephon Marbury

427
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
Wore a $15

428
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
Sneaker

429
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
Sales of the star berry

430
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Tok off

431
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:14,143
Steve & Barry's expanded the line Beyond just the basketball sneaker and in total over the next year-and-a-half they sold

432
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,447
Around 4 million pairs

433
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Starbury sneakers

434
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
Instaff on for his part

435
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
Kevin Durant 8 million dollars

436
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
In royalties off of clothes

437
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
And shoes

438
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,479
Duffy's Bar not Air Jordan numbers but remember they didn't have to

439
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
Because Stefan was making affordable shoes

440
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
Fat people wanted

441
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
And he was making money

442
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
The experiment

443
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,695
Was a success

444
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
It had worked

445
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,071
7 Plex a point to this one moment in particular

446
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
Thumbs this up

447
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
It's from one of his store appearances and is actually video

448
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
When is a little kid

449
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
He shopping with his mom

450
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
And he's picking out all of these clothes and then he just goes and he walks to the camera he said

451
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,759
I'm living in a dream mean

452
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
I'm in a dream

453
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
Veteran

454
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
It did not last forever

455
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
Because in 2008

456
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
The financial crisis

457
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
Howard schachter

458
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Send it hit Steven berries

459
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
Particularly hard

460
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,399
Retailers that work on thin margin

461
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,215
Rely heavily on the credit markets

462
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,823
To give them a line of credit in which to go out and buy inventory

463
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,663
And then you saw that inventory and pay back the bank and

464
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,943
And keep going

465
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,223
But credit lines

466
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Froze up

467
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
And Steven Berry's filed for bankruptcy

468
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,879
Without the store the $15 sneaker experiment

469
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:43,999
What's Done Steven berries was the exclusive provider of the sneaker and they were the ones

470
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
Handling the manufacturer

471
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Those with their connect

472
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
Those were my connection

473
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,191
Other things were also going badly for Stefani

474
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,239
His father had died tragic

475
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
His basketball team was struggling and he was getting blame

476
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Time for it

477
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,127
Plus he wanted young anymore

478
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,687
And so in 2009

479
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
He decided

480
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
It was time to

481
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Stefan left the NBA

482
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,087
And you left the starbury sneakers experiment behind

483
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
But then

484
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,207
Stephon Marbury resurrected his career

485
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
In the one place

486
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,559
That might still give his sneaker dream

487
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
A chance

488
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,607
Rihanna

489
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
Washu ma bully

490
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
After the break

491
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,703
Stephon Marbury

492
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
China

493
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:32,127
What I ate youngboy what does it mean I love China

502
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,143
In 2010 after Stephon Marbury had left the NBA

503
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
If you want to play professional basketball in China

504
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,031
After a couple years he landed on the Beijing ducks

505
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,335
A beloved perennial Underdog

506
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,383
They had never won a champion

507
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,711
So we go we went 13 games in a row out the gate

508
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,295
Stephon Marbury led the Beijing ducks to its first championship

509
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
And that another

510
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
And then another

511
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
He has since become one of the most

512
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
Famous basketball players

513
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
In Chinese basketball head

514
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,840
It's like a whole new life baby I can't tell you no lie

515
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
It's the truth

516
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
Statues Museum

517
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,008
Am I mistaken there was like a musical also did a musical

518
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
I did a play

519
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
From that moment

520
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,968
The Vice news organization actually went and recorded this play

521
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,952
Stefan is now very well connected in China

522
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,024
The global capital of sneaker Manufacturing

523
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,352
And of course basketball players are still putting a name

524
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,424
Amazon basketball sneakers and charging an absurd amount

525
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
And so Stefan

526
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,264
Has decided it is time

527
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
To bring back

528
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
The star berry

529
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
A solid

530
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
Affordable basketball shoe with his name

531
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,480
Is currently a limited run of starburys available online

532
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,784
They're ramping up production now

533
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
Instafont will still sell

534
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
A $15 basket

535
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,464
Can you still make and sell basketball sneakers for $15

536
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
That you could

537
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
Play basketball in

538
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
Yes you can

539
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
It's happening

540
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
It is happening

541
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
Exciting

542
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
I'm very excite

543
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,520
Cuz I want all the little kids to be happy when they plan on the court refresh Pig kicks

544
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
You understand that's what it's really about

545
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
This time around though

546
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
He's also going to be selling some higher-end

547
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Although

548
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
What's the fun higher-end means

549
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
50 bucks

550
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
60 bucks

551
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,088
The shoes will mostly be sold online

552
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,904
But there is a plan to have a couple of flagships

553
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,976
One in Brooklyn possibly Coney Island

554
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
Neighborhood works

555
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
Stephon grew up

556
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
The other one

557
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
In Stefan's new home

558
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,352
