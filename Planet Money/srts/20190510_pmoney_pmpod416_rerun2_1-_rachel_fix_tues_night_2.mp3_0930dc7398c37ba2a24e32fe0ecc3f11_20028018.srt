And for economist

35
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
This is a

36
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,088
Total freak of nature kind of

37
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,928
Prices you can read in any textbook are supposed to go up

38
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
And down

39
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,512

40
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,304

49
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,456
It's the basic mechanism for how markets work

50
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,528
And yet for 70 years

51
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,832
You could buy a Coke for $0.05

52
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:34,720

76
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
It's not a secret that

77
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
Coke cost a nickel for so long

78
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,064
You can go to any antique store and see the old signs

79
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,904
If you go to the Coca-Cola museum in Atlanta the tour guide will tell you

80
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
And normally people on the tour will just not

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah things used to be cheap

82
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,816
But one day a guy named Daniel Levy

83
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
He took his kids to that

84
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Called The World of Coke

85
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,216
Entice families on this tour and the tour guide just mentioned

86
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,240
This nickel coaxing

87
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
And Levi thinks

88
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
Wait what

89
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
Goodnight heard that I said can you say that again

90
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,248
And he repeated and I kind of food crops my in my head right I should

91
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
How can that be

92
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,320
Daniel Levy UC is Anakin

93
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,600
And for him

94
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
This is a mystery

95
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
So he basically hijacks the tour

96
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
Start asking all these questions

97
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
How could coke stay nickel

98
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
Go for so long

99
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
And it's all guys like

100
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
I don't know

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
I don't know

102
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,448
The Daniel goes back to Emory University where he works and he find

103
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Andrew Young

104
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,872
Daniel did kind of walk in and say that he found this crazy thing one day and you know I need a research assistant do you want to help me out

105
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,688
Project IGI sounds really interesting let's do it

106
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
The more they think about it

107
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
Single price

108
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
470 years

109
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Stranger it seems

110
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,368
This puzzle becomes really

111
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,440
Really amazing when you actually consider

112
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
What has happened during that period

113
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
Be at the Great Depression

114
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:23,679
Free Wars Spanish American World War 1 World War including Pepsi

115
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,543
Hundreds of competitors probation varios lawsuits end

116
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:33,919
None of this sinks made any difference basically like 1886 into the 1950s

117
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:40,831
All of all of these you know dramatic changes to the economy going on and then one constant through it all was that you could

118
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,159
To get six and a half ounces of Coca-Cola at the fountain or in a bottle

119
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
457

120
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,303
If you think that's just because Coca-Cola came up with Incredible Innovations to cut cost

121
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
To keep the price down

122
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
This is not that story

123
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
It's a much stranger

124
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,727
The tour guide went Daniels and Grilling and said

125
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
You should go to the Coca-Cola Park

126
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
So Daniel and Andrew do

127
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,383
And it has all this stuff

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,527
Posters calendars novelty items his film uni the Coca-Cola Company archivist

129
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
He says the company has saved

130
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,623
Everything metal signs

131
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
Magazine advertising radio and television advertising Department of Records

132
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:26,143
Product files executive correspondence the secret formula for Coke in there somewhere

133
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
That is one thing that is not there

134
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
So are Economist are going through the archive

135
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,823
Muni the archivist says he can explain

136
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,591
Hannah Coco

137
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
It was an attempt to attract customer

138
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
Late 1800s were the days of soda fountains

139
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
And there were lots of soda fountain drink

140
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
They were primarily

141
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,415
Fruit-flavored drinks oranges and grapes what was the cost of the competitors

142
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,023
7/8 baby tencent somewhere $0.05 but

143
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
Coco Quinn

144
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
Very specifically to Market itself

145
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
As an affordable product

146
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,751
The first sale we know is in Atlanta at a store on Peachtree Road

147
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
On May 8th

148
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
1886

149
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,615
I'm reading from the Coca-Cola official history here

150
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,223
Dr. John Stith Pemberton a local pharmacist produce the syrup for Coca-Cola

151
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,831
And carried a jug down the street to Jacob's Pharmacy where it was sampled pronounce

152
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Excellent

153
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
And placed on sale for $0.05 a glass

154
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Eva soda fountain

155
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Okay that's the easy part

156
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
That's how it started

157
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,095
But why did coke stay in nickel for 70 years

158
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,935
The two Economist Andrew and Daniel start going deeper and deeper into the ark

159
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
Guys reading everything I can

160
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,007
Books company history

161
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
Andrew Young find this story that

162
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,103
Seems to explain part of the mystery

163
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
Of why Coke remained price

164
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
It has to do with two lawyers from Chattanooga Tennessee

165
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
In 1899

166
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
Those lawyers pay a visit to the president

167
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Coca-Cola

168
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
His name is a second

169
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,439
And they tell him they are interested in this new thing

170
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Bottles

171
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,511
Selling drinks in bottles

172
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
They want to buy the bottling right

173
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
And

174
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,631
Asa Candler the president of Koch thanks

175
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Bottles

176
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
This is a soda fountain business

177
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
The way The Story Goes is Candler just said you're out of your mind

178
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:12,127
If I can at least I could be effective it's not going to work you're going to lose all your money

179
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,991
And they said well please you'll give us the rights anyway until you just said yeah I'll sign this piece of paper

180
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,087
So just be I'll just sign this piece of paper that says yeah you know whenever you want and I'll just tell you

181
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Syrup

182
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
The concentrate at $0.90 a gallon

183
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
In agreeing to do that Kendall did something companies

184
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Never do

185
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
Agreed to sell its product

186
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
The syrup to bottlers

187
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
For a fixed price

188
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
Forever

189
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,751
The contract had no end date it was a Perpetual infinite non ending contract

190
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
You could never charge more for his product

191
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
Why would he do that

192
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151
My best take on it is that

193
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
Yeah really this was just

194
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Trying to get two guys out of your office

195
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,855
That mean anytime you get two lawyers in your office you probably want to leave Ryan he's just saying

196
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,183
I'll sign this piece of paper if you'll just please leave my office

197
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
I never thought twice about it

198
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,791
This was a problem for the Coca-Cola Company because of course

199
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Bottled drinks took off

200
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
And Coca Cola ad sign this contract

201
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,959
Basically saying it would never raise the price of the syrup to

202
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
To the bottlers

203
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,287
This does not explain why coke stay Tunica

204
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Because

205
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
The bottlers could sell a bottle for whatever they wanted

206
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Stuck at the corner store

207
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Sixth Sense

208
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
$0.07 or $0.10

209
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
It's what Coca-Cola did next

210
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
The cap the price at an echo

211
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,647
Understand that you have to think about the situation from Coca-Cola's perspecta

212
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Because

213
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,231
You've agreed to sell your syrup to the bottle is traffic

214
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
Any increase in price at the corner store

215
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
It doesn't help

216
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
You don't get any of the extra profit

217
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
The Profit goes to the bottlers in the retail

218
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,007
And in fact if they raise the price

219
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
It hurts you

220
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
If Coco's up to a dime

221
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
Fewer people are going to buy it

222
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
And you Coca-Cola

223
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,431
End up selling less serum

224
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,783
So if your Coca-Cola you want somehow

225
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
To keep the price down at $0.05

226
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
What do you do

227
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,207
Well one thing you do is you blanket the entire nation

228
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,767
With with Coca-Cola advertising

229
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,839
That basically has five cents prominently featured

230
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
Think about how brilliant this is

231
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Coca-Cola

232
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,519
Is taking control of the pricing away from the bottlers and the corner store

233
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
The company

234
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,127
Can't actually put a sticker on the bottle of coke saying $0.05

235
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,943
But it can put up a huge billboard

236
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
Paint the side of the building right next to the store that says

237
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,319
Drink Coca Cola 5 cents

238
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Again Daniel Levy

239
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
I'm holding in my hand

240
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Life Magazine

241
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
Find a Life Magazine they know

242
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:41,119
Quite old actually this particular one is a Life Magazine from 1980

243
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
13 July 10

244
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,823
And did the back of this magazine said is the recent ad of Coca-Cola and it says drink Coca-Cola

245
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
It's $0.05 delicious and refreshing

246
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
Is pointy stud

247
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,527
Since everybody was brainwashed people so this at all over

248
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,855
And this included $0.05

249
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
It was part of the commodity to foremost

250
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
It was hard for anybody to increase the price

251
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
Anyone selling a bottle of coke for more than $0.05

252
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
It's going to look like a jerk

253
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
But what about the soda fountain

254
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,215
People ran the soda Fountains at the corner store

255
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,287
Okay the ads made it so they couldn't charge more than a nickel

256
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
But they could use smaller glasses

257
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Or skin pain syrup

258
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
So what do you do if your Coca-Cola

259
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
Crisfield money the company archives

260
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
You provided them with the glass

261
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
That was one point that you did it

262
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,415
And for many years it was actually

263
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
A line drawn

264
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
In the glass

265
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,023
To show you where

266
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
How far to draw the syrup

267
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,911
And then went with how does it feel like carbonated water.

268
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
How to complete the drink

269
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
That's a very clever way to control how much

270
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
People getting

271
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
That was the idea

272
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,639
This explains part of the mystery of why Coca-Cola state of nickel

273
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,407
For so long

274
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
Coca-Cola was locked into this weird contract

275
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
For the bottlers

276
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
But there had to be something else going

277
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,135
Because in 1921 Coca-Cola managed to renegotiate the car

278
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,719
The price of sugar gone up in the company was losing money so

279
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
Bottlers eventually can see

280
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
Finally the Coca-Cola company was back in control

281
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
I could do whatever it wanted

282
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,471
After two decades of being Shackled by a bad contract

283
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,263
Coke didn't have to be iniquity

284
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
So what happened

285
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
It stayed a nickel anyway

286
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
Part of the reason was just that advertising

287
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
It was so effective the company is locked

288
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Itself in

289
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,319
I think how long it would take to repaint All Those ads on the sides of the building

290
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,111
Are Coca Cola trays

291
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
It said $0.05

292
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
All the stuff

293
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
Given enough time that could have change

294
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
But

295
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
There was this one final hurdle

296
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
I heard about the size of a refrigerator

297
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Painted bright red

298
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
The vending machine

299
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,727
At this point in history vending machines aren't equipped to make

300
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Change

301
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
And the Coca-Cola vending machines

302
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
They're built to take one coin

303
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
And that coin

304
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Is a nickel

305
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
These machines

306
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
They were everywhere

307
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
Here's Daniel Levy

308
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
More and more sales of Coca-Cola

309
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
Firme true vending machines

310
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
1950

311
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
To give you a sense

312
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,535
There were about 460,000 vending machines in the US

313
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,911
400000 of them belonged to Coca-Cola going through the archives Daniel and Andrew say

314
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:28,031
It is clear that the people at Coca-Cola really wanted to raise the price of Coke

315
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
But they couldn't

316
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,639
Because of these machines that only took single coin

317
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
7 people at Coca-Cola

318
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,503
If only there were another coin

319
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
There's a dime

320
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
But that would double the

321
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
No really

322
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,647
We want something in between

323
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,975
So here is some of your clever idea what they came up with Stacy

324
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
How about we

325
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,351
We asked the treasury to issue 7 and 1/2 cent coin

326
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,167
The US Treasury the government

327
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,495
Daniel Andrew say at one point the head of Coca-Cola

328
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Asti

329
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
President of the United States

330
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,335
Eisenhower for help

331
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Mature hunting

332
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:08,991
And it wasn't just Coca-Cola this was a crisis for any business that sold through vending machine

333
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
But

334
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
No luck

335
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
There's never been a seven and a half

336
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
Coca-Cola was still desperate

337
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
To raise the price

338
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
So desperate in fact of the company came up with what

339
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
Andrew Young called a harebrained idea

340
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,607
This never actually saw the light of day but

341
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
They're a bunch of references to it in the ark

342
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
We're going to do some internal memos and pulled out this

343
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,847
Yo stapled pack of you know maybe 10 pages the right in the front of it says single coin plan

344
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,455
Oh my God what is this the single coin plan was a very clever way

345
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
To charge more for a bottle of Coke

346
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,575
Without having to adjust the vending machines at all

347
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
I'll let Daniel Levy

348
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,951
Cutest what did they basically came up with she said

349
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,255
Okay we are going to increase the price

350
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,095
But people will still be using nickel so how they do that

351
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Did they said

352
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
They're going to make

353
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
Every 9th bottle

354
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,519
Individual machine it will be an empty bottle

355
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:08,383
Decode that bottle that Empty Bottle they called it an official blank

356
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
An empty bottle

357
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,991
So eight customers in a row with panicle and funk

358
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Outlook

359
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,087
The Unlucky 9% would put a nickel in

360
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Clink

361
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
An empty bottle

362
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
Got to put in a second

363
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
So sometimes you're lucky sometimes you're not

364
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
On average

365
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
You end up paying slightly more than the nickel

366
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
Average price the effective price now is

367
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,447
5.6 to $0.05

368
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,263
I can imagine customers waiting hate that

369
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919
I'd be so pissed if I put in a nickel and I got an empty bottle of coke not even just a thing saying sorry if you need to pay

370
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
Pay an extra axial Empty Bottle

371
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:50,623
It just make me angry I think that's that's that's that's one

372
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
Reason to abandon this policy

373
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,999
But I thought it was very quick very clever idea though

374
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,583
Vending machines that reliably make change are available by 19

375
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,167
But the thing that finally undoes the nickel Coke

376
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
Is something else

377
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
After the break

378
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
The end of nickel

379
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:15,455

Inflation is definitely sort of the death-knell for the nickel Coke there's no doubt about that

389
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,927
You might think inflation would have been a problem for Coca-Cola the whole time

390
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
But Andrea says

391
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,279
There wasn't really inflation before the 1940s

392
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,887
Yes prices with me and her up sometimes sugar in the ingredients cost more

393
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
But they made me under back down

394
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
After the 1940s

395
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
Inflation is here to stay

396
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Prices just keep going

397
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
What happened

398
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
The US went off the gold standard

399
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
Dollars no longer had to be backed by gold

400
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:24,063
Simplifying things but basically we have no longer got the golden anchor

401
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
And so at that point the amount of

402
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,975
Money just keep going up and up and up which means that prices go up and up and up

403
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
Well prices are going up and up and up

404
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
You just can't keep your

405
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,143
You can keep your Coca-Cola for nickel for too much longer

406
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,935
So in a way

407
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,239
Nickel Coke died because we went off the gold

408
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,311
You don't you can actually you can make that argue

409
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
In 1946 and 47

410
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,175
You start to see cokes on sale for more than a nickel

411
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Sixth Sense

412
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
7th Sense

413
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
It's a big deal

414
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,575
The Press reports on it Fortune Magazine in 1951

415
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
Rezin Optical called

416
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
The nickel Coke is groggy

417
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,439
Like its unsteady ready to fall

418
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
At 8.

419
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,791
The last available Mexico seems to have been

420
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
Sometime in 19th

421
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
4 Andrew Young and Daniel Levy

422
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
The story says

423
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,775
One is just that life is messier than the textbooks tell you

424
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,079
Yes prices in the market generally adjust

425
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
There are weird contracts

426
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Vending machine

427
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
And also

428
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
Prices are complicated things

429
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
They get stuck

430
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
And we get stuck on them

431
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,647
There was a time between the contract and the vending machine

432
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,719
When the Coca-Cola Company could have changed it

433
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
But it didn't

434
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,559
Coca-Cola early on said

435
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
Coke cost a nickel

436
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
I put it on Billboard

437
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
Can ads painted on buildings

438
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
And people got used to it

439
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
It felt like a promise

440
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
In a way

441
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
All prices

442
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Is kind of feel like

443
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
Once we see a price on something

444
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
We have this

445
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,759
Feeling like that some innate property of the thing that it should not change

446
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
Prices have the psychological component

447
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,927
That's why companies will often shrink a product rather than raise the price

448
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,975
Put your potato chips in the bag

449
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
Make the ice cream container

450
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
14 oz

451
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
Instead of a pint

452
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
I'm looking at you Haagen-Dazs

453
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
So

454
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Prices gets.

455
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
But Daniel Levy says as far as he knows

456
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
Nickel Coke is the longest documented sticky price

457
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
In modern history

458
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,871
Nickel Coke persisted for 70 years

459
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
And in retrospect

460
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
It wasn't a bad thing for the company

461
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,783
Is one Legacy of this weird history

462
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,623
That Coca-Cola is now everywhere is this time we think of coke is being everywhere

463
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:39,231
Is that in part because they were stuck with a nickel price in the only way to make more money was

464
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
What's the sell more coke

465
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
So they really put every effort into

466
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,399
My sense is that that is that is a big part of it

467
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,239
That Coca-Cola was forced to push volume to be more profitable

468
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
They couldn't adjust its price

469
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,431
And so it did it very very powerful push volume at at one point they were associated with the middle

470
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:03,807
Terry there were Coca-Cola Bottling operations on every single continent except for Antarctica during World War II

471
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,135
All there to make sure that our soldiers could always get

472
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
Coca-Cola in a bottle

473
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Water fountain

474
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
Barnacle

475
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Today

476
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Koch's are larger

477
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
And the cost of a dollar more at

478
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
Write a vending machine

479
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
Nickel Coke seems like a long time

480
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
Though Phil Mooney the Coca-Cola archivist

481
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
Find out this one strange thing

482
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,591
In many respects the nickel Coke is soda still around

483
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,895
If you do it on a per ounce basis

484
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:34,015
Buy 2 liter bottle for dollar $29.39 in the grocery store on sale

485
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
And that's pretty close to

486
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,391
The original nickel Coke is very very

487
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695
I mention this to Andrew Young The Economist

488
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
He said

489
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
That's a nice way to think about it

490
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
It's still with us

491
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
Justin Baker Botts

492
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
Laminate now has a Weekly Newsletter asking interesting economic question

493
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,831
Like he's buying a house overrated

494
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,695
Are there ways in which plastic bag bans may actually be harming the environment
