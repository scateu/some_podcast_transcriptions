16
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,216
That I gave you when I was a kid

17

This is Smith Robert has been talking incessantly

25
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
It's not exactly

26
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:09,376
That's what I was telling everyone hear about the guy who sold

27
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,168
Me the knife how it was

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Kid

29
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,776
State Fair and he started to demonstrate it

30
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,848
He did all these tricks with again all these jokes and at one point

31
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
Cuts

32
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,408
An aluminum can in half

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
And then he slices tomatoes

34
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,504
So thin he says

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,040
You can read a newspaper

36
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,880
So then he says you can make a single tomato last all summer

37
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
I remember you

38
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
You were up

39
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
Stuffed with

40
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,512
You stood there for an hour right now

41
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,864
He stood there for an hour watching somebody demonstrate a stupid Ginsu knife

42
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Yes

Kid fun things

45
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
And all I really wanted to do is to demonstrate a knife

46
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
At a state fair

47
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
That really was your goal

48
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah but it was the state fair there's a million other fun things to do

49
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,176
But there is a million of it

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
He looks quite

51
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
He he was

52
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Thought you was going to call me special

53
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,392
Child is worried about that

54
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
Mrs. Smith

55
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
Hypethetic

56
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
If I were to go to a state

57
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
Robert

58
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,400
Do you have any advice for me

59
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,448
Well I think you have a really

60
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Time with him

61
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752

Two other

It is way more than that when I was a child that salesman that knife salesman pulled off an amazing magic trick

71
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
You can miss me

72
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,688

To ask

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,632
Why in the age of Amazon and Walmart

81
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:23,520
Why do you need to go to a building at the fairgrounds to buy anything why does this even still exist

82
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,848
I Will Show You Kenny and we'll finally get to look behind the curtain

83
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,688

1850

112
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,479
Held in Columbus Ohio right down the center through the Midway

113
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
It's where all the classics

114
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:44,159
I want a donut burger but I want the burger patties to be the bun and the donut in the middle

115
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:50,303
Of course you got all of the games here as well

116
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,631
I don't want any of those prices though I went the basketball with the money

117
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679

This is amazing

123
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,943
So Robert and I are standing outside of a building it

Between the pig Barn in the fry Shack

125
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,319
And all I can say at this point it's just a set of doors

126
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
That I would normally walk straight past if I were not at the fair with Robert just opening

127
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
This place is huge

128
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,167
This place has not changed since I was in a very similar place if you don't state fair when I was at

It is

00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
It's a building like a warehouse

131
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
It is

00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
If you are thinking at home

00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
OMG

161
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,143
That's a potato peeler

162
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
You're right

163
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:34,495
It's called the OMG peeler

164
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287

191
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Out of the spotlight

192
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
He would take the money from the customer

193
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
He was hired

194
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,543
To help

195
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
But the whole time he was watching the pitchman

196
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Thinking

197
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
I can do this

198
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Do you remember your first time

199
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
Yeah I'm still up

200
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Yeah what was the product

201
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
That was a hose nozzle

202
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,183
The ultimate Hotel

203
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
What did it feel like nervous

204
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Nervous the first time is really

205
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Nervous

206
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Well you know him

207
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:08,447
Still a few jokes from some of the other pitch man and he was officer to draw crowds people started

208
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
Empire

209
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
And now Tommy has become

210
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,847
Part of this small band of pitchman and Pitch women

211
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Who are like

212
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
Product

213
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Mercenary

214
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
And say your company that

215
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
Owns some Prada

216
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
Or maybe you're a distributor of some

217
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
And you want to sell it

218
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,135
Will you call up

219
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
One of these products

220
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
Mercenaries wherever they made

221
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
And

222
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,791
They fly out stay at a hotel on the edge of town

223
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:39,423
And come in and sell the hell out of your product and it can be a different product each week one one day your

224
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
Sewing a hose nozzle in Nashville

225
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,543
And then they send you to Memphis for the steam mop

226
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
These folks

227
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,919
These are who the young Robbie Smith looked up to

228
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,991
When I was a kid oh my God like I thought

229
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,039
You guys were the greatest

230
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,623
That's what's so funny and it looks so smooth

231
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
Does Mickey make it look easy

232
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,999
But not making it look too easy where they don't think they can do it at home

233
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559
If I walk behind there for just a moment

234
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:12,703
Roberts walking around 2 behind the presentation booth

235
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,055
The world doesn't look different because you can tell people who are sort of avoiding eye contact

236
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
They avoid you because I know you're trying to sell himself

237
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
Yeah she just gave us a two second look and then looked completely away so this guy just to look of derision

238
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,063
A woman's skin

239
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
Milady you want to watch while you're eating

240
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Your sandwich

241
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Might as well

242
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Who that looks good right

243
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
Y'all ever heard of a spiralizer or veggetti

244
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,887
And boom he is back into the pitch and if we're talking about interviewing

245
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
Tommie Harris is the

246
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,543
If you're talking to him but someone walks by and looks like they might be interested mid-sentence

247
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
He's out and he is back in

248
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,663
Yesterday he works on commission Tommy did not invent

249
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,223
Tommy doesn't own this giant stack of

250
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,575
He sells them for $20 and makes about 5 bucks Commission on each way

251
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,903
But he is paying for his own travel and his own lodging

252
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,951
By our calculations you need to sell

253
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
About a hundred

254
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
Peelers

255
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
To break even on this

256
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
Scramble easy

257
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
If you have kids

258
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
I could watch him all day

259
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
Nope nope we will not watch him all day long but

260
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Tommy says

261
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
If you want to go see someone who has a little bit of a

262
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
Different style maybe a little bit more outgoing

263
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
Check out the woman who's pitching in the row over

264
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
Who also happens to be his fiance

265
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
Roshes

266
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
She's here

267
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
She's right around the corner

268
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
We hear from here

269
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
Only if she starts laughing

270
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
Really

271
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
You got a big laugh you'll see

272
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
This is Heather Keto

273
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,631
Nothing Heather's great at is called the hook the hook is when you

274
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
You grab someone

275
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
Attention somehow

276
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
And then you get them interested enough

277
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
To watch your

278
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,543
And we see this in action we are walking

279
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
Ward Heather's Boot & Shoe

280
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
Leaning over with

281
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Huge grin

282
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Walking eye contact

283
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
In which she had her arm like she wants to shake my

284
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,343
I got to come on over here y'all want to try it out makes your life a lot easier

285
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
Into my hands

286
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
What do you say Garden

287
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
It is in fact

288
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
The Tiger

289
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
The tiger jaw

290
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
They are basically

291
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Pruning shears

292
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
A before I could set it out Heather pulls out

293
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,679
A branch of real piece of wood

294
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
It offers it up right in front of me to cut

295
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
Go for it

296
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
You know you want to

297
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Great Clips

298
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
Oh oh oh

299
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
Robert

300
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,991
I'm in the zone I'm cutting

301
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,807
And then Heather's like

302
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
And then she holds up

303
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Her right hand

304
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,559
That's you are missing almost all of your pinky

305
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,863
And your middle fingers a little shorter

306
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
What's the story

307
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,495
It was a car wreck she said she's grateful.

308
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
This was the extent of the injury

309
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
But she says she does use it as part of her demonstration

310
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,711
And what's amazing about the way Heather has hooked Robert

311
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Into her present a

312
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,831
Is it she's put him in a position where in order to walk away

313
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
He has to put down the fun new toy

314
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,463
It's a loss like no more chopping Sticks no more

315
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
Wow factor

316
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
Innocent thing that amazon.com

317
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,631
Frankly cannot do for all of their selling prowess

318
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,215
They cannot physically put a product in my hand while I'm considering

319
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,543
And there's a certain type of product that is here

320
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
It's the kind of thing that

321
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,919
You need to see put your hands on in order to understand

322
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,711
Why it's valuable at all

323
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Or Weiss different

324
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
From from any other product

325
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
The kind of looks like

326
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,135
And you can see this in some of the stuff that Heather has sold in the past

327
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,535
The LED light candles the Steam Mop I've done I've done the hose nozzle here

328
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,351
The ultimate Heist novel

329
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,679
Hanging with Heather

330
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
This guy that walks by in

331
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,311
Holding by her hook and spring into its branches

332
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
There's no effort at all

333
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
That's really easy

334
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,967
When he starts to say well you know this might be

335
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,783
Be good for my mom or bring my mom buying lottery tickets

336
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Can get one of them big ones

337
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
And then he walks

338
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
And Robert Chase

339
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
I have a quick question for you I'm going to whisper it a little bit

340
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
Soda like

341
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:24,607
I'll be back later I'll have my mom check it out thing is that just you can walk away get you out of there

342
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,959
Really then I can send your mom back here I'm going to tell her about it but I'm not going to

343
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
She's at home

344
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
I'll tell her about tiger Joe

345
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
But you just didn't want to

346
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,127
I will make her mad and upset the lady you know

347
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
Yeah Heather has a name for

348
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
People they are called

349
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Leaner

350
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:45,343
The reason hook but then turn the presentation they start leaning away

351
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Looking for an excuse to lie

352
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,439
In fact we learned that there's all kinds of greatly

353
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
Lingo in the world

354
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Of the pitch

355
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,535
Heather works at what we in the

356
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Like to call

357
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
A red giant

358
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
Give me the time that the product is selling

359
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
A red dress

360
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,983
Sometimes you get stuck with

361
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
O'Leary

362
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
That's a product that nobody wants

363
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Yes we asked

364
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,383
Nobody knows who Larry is but man he must have been

365
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
A total JC

366
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
JCL

367
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
Stanford johnny-come-lately

368
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Sleeping around here they just say JCL

369
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
And it's a pitchman without a lot of it

370
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
Yes I'm going to ask too many questions

371
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Who's desperate for

372
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
The approval of the

373
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Pitching greats

374
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Robert

375
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Kept going around

376
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,815
And asking who is the best pitch man here

377
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,631
Yeah and people did eventually point us towards

378
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
The booth

379
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Where they sell

380
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
The most amazing shower head you've ever

381
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
You want to look through a little picture on it

382
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,567
Football pictures

383
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
Where they sell a shower

384
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,807
It's the most amazing shower head you ever seen as pitched

385
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Bike

386
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
DJ mix

387
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
Let me Give an example what you get

388
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,975
Memo longer growing up on you sometimes play with a garden hose

389
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:01,119
And you really want to shoot that kid across the street with a hose what did you do you put your thumb on the hose

390
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,167
That's your first restrictor valve

391
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,263
All we did with this was designed it with a hundred thumbs on a hundred hoses pointing down

392
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
It is a very powerful shower head

393
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
The PJs between this

394
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
Longer than anyone else we met at the fair

395
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,991
He sold everything to everyone looks a lot like Louis CK

396
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,527
The comedian who grew up in the Bronx

397
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
Huge Yankees fan

398
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
And here's why I love him he

399
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
Still record

400
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,487
His pictures so we can listen back and see like artichokes Landing

401
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
How's the audience react

402
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,863
You don't understand this difference between a professional salesman and I got to talk to you

403
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
Really

404
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,727
The most insulting thing we hear is when someone says you're a natural-born Salesman

405
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
What screw you

406
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
Spent a lot of time and effort

407
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,591
And a lot of energy to learn how to do this properly

408
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
Until we save for PJ

409
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
The hardest quest

410
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
The hardest question of pitchman face

411
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
You pooped in your crowd

412
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,831
But some of them are starting to look like they're leaners

413
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
How do you close

414
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
The deal

415
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Close move

416
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
The best clothes

417
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
The best poses asking for the money

418
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,839
I'll ask you three questions this product better than one you have now

419
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Usually they say yeah

420
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,215
Then I was asking this but defensively and always back up and put my Palms up

421
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,567
If you bought this today would you use it I mean not everybody needs a new shower right okay

422
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
You cannot see this

423
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,175
But at this point PJ McGee has stepped back from the customer

424
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
His hands

425
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Are like

426
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:27,135
Like he's being robbed and he like as if he sang oh oh no did I

427
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,439
I like to keep going

428
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,743
And then

429
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
PJ McGee

430
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Has you

431
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
You want to use debit credit to cash

432
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,631
Biggest problem with salespeople

433
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,703
95% of new sales people are afraid to ask for the money

434
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
Get into another business

435
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
Nobody goes to the fair to buy a shower head

436
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
But PJ McGee

437
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
Has already sold 10

438
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Just today

439
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
They cost

440
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
100

441
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,319
Dollars I know and if I wasn't coming to the backpack

442
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
I might about to

443
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
You used to be

444
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
Irrational economic

445
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
Text reporter when we flew

446
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
To the fair I know

447
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,559
I know and I do have a

448
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
The theory about this

449
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
I've been thinking about it for 30 years

450
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,471
Am I serious that like normally

451
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
When I shop and most of the shop

452
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
It is a pretty

453
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
Cerebral

454
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
You know you going to amazon.com

455
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
I read every review

456
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,503
Oh it's one of the 17cm to the 1971

457
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
How does it compare with the sc3000 model get shirt

458
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Better normal people shop

459
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Yeah but

460
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
The fear

461
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
Short circuits that

462
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Logical

463
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Heart of

464
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,583
Because everything here is a century

465
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Overload

466
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,679
Every decision made at the fair is a decision made on

467
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Sure

468
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Emotion

469
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
Remember when we first got here

470
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
Remember when I first got here

471
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
And you smell

472
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
Kettle corn

473
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
I'm so happy

474
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,391
Remember when we first walked on the Midway when we first got there and everyone shouting out all of the choices

475
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,791
We can make so many bad choices we could make

476
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,351
And then we walk past

477
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,191
Games to play

478
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
Basketball you know

479
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:24,383
The size of a basketball hoop and these were way too little you could not help your side

480
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:30,783
But I can't win a basketball with pictures of money on it I do not believe that you kept losing and asking me for more money

481
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
I will give you credit you did

482
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
Get the basketball in the hoop

483
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,767
But it was not logical for you to do so and my theory is

484
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
50s

485
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Century

486
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Experian

487
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
Creates an urgent need

488
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,495
Inuit Cretin need you want something now

489
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
And then

490
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
All these people here

491
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
They sell you the thing that

492
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
If it feels the knee

493
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,431
They bring you from desire to satisfaction

494
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
In under a minute

495
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:05,343
So if you can't feel the potato you probably shouldn't drive a car stay away from clip watch out for lightning outside now

496
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,671
Before we leave the fair we wanted to check in one last time

497
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
With Tommy Harris

498
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,023
The guy we met initially Hawking the OMG

499
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,863
What time is pinch a few times people trying to leave for the day

500
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
And it comes to me

501
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
This

502
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Is

503
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
My Moment

504
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
I'm going to ask Tommy

505
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
I could try just once

506
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
To do my own pest

507
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
And I'm going to live my dream

508
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
A pitching

509
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
Kitchen object

510
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
At the State Fair

511
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,551
To be fair Robert did not exactly ask

512
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
Not exact

513
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
He went behind the booth

514
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Talk to Tommy

515
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
Started inching

516
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,023
Closer and closer

517
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,327
Grab the OMG peeler

518
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,119
Wait and started

519
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Yell at

520
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471
Do you like food you eat food to prepare food

521
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,031
I can do food for you look at this thing

522
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
It is super hard

523
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,383
Appeal and talk at the same time

524
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,199
I love pasta more than anybody but

525
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:08,063
Casa muscle make it look like me ladies you do not want this to happen I have no hook

526
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,903
I have no clothes

527
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,999
That's why we have this wonderful spiral

528
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
Coloring

529
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Powerline

530
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Spiralizer

531
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
Roberts enthusiasm

532
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655
Does pull people over to the booth

533
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,471
It was exciting it was totally exciting but

534
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
Once real customer showed up

535
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
Tommy

536
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Smoothly

537
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,847
Takes a peeler out of robbers hand

538
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
And take so

539
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,247
Oh sorry about that

540
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,319
But you got the spiralizer noodles so you can forget it

541
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Now you can go

542
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,647
Robert sort of slinks to the back of the booth

543
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,975
Watches the pitch finish

544
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
And then goes back up

545
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:54,911
How how was I was just way too much was it you were kind of like a teenager in the back with carpet

546
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,471
The first time just a little like

547
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Excited

548
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
Paul Roberts totally fair

549
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,383
That is totally fair

550
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
Okay okay I did not make

551
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
A single cell

552
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:17,440
But I did get to feel what it is like what it is like to be

553
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
The JCL

554
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,304
The johnny-come-lately and now you know what it feels like

555
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
Turn a red joint

556
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
In Tulare

557
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,912
Not good but

558
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
It was my

559
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,152
Support for this podcast and the following message come from Madewell
