1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,584
It has been said

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,912
On Wikipedia and in some newspapers

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,728
But you are one of the greatest fundraisers

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,544
Working today is it true

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,944
That's very kind of you to say I think there are probably people who raised many many more dollars than I do

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,040
But he has raised millions of dollars for The nuyorican Poets Cafe

7
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,880
Nuyorican is a term for a New Yorker of Puerto Rican heritage

8
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
It's a performance space

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,952
It's been going since the 70s

10
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,328
Daniel took over about eleven years ago and he is a genius at raising money for artists

11
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:40,448
It's pledge time here at NPR and so I went to him to ask him how he does it

12
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,752
I think what's most important is

13
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,824
To focus on the work that you love and conveying that work

14
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,384
In a way that you feel good about

15
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,456
So it sounds like if you have a tip for me that it might be

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:57,600
As long as you really believe in what you're doing asking for money is not that difficult you just

17
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,136
Tell the truth

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
I would also say don't ask for money

19
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
Instead

20
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
Instead explain what you do and why you're passionate about explain who it helps why it helps them

21
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
Why you're proud to be there

22
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,752
While I go off and think about why I'm proud to

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,568
To be here I am also going to slip you a website URL

Are you ready I'm ready operation Pantego

30
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,472
I'm going to pretend to tie my shoe but I'm actually going to deploy a penny on the sidewalk of New York your hand

31
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
42nd Street

32
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
David playing it cool

33
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Italian shoe

34
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,920
Shiny shiny penny is now the middle the sidewalk we're going to walk away

35
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,992
Go hide behind the lamp post over there

36
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
We got we wanted to do an experiment

37
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,112
See how long it would take before someone picked

38
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
The penny

39
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
In the green shirt no

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
Hipster in the shoes now

41
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:20,032
Those are under 8 years old nothing we hung out or

42
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
Half an hour

43
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
Types of thousand people walk by

44
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
Pennies out

45
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
Nothing worth

46
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
Penny's seem to be invisible would you

47
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,136
You ever pick up a penny have you ever picked up a penny

48
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,208
I don't pay attention to them

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,024
I think you're a little bit in the way more than invisible

50
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,632
What are you rich guy just walked by money on the street

51
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Finally

52
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:52,288
We resorted to stopping people pointing at their feet and think there is a penny on the street

53
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Are you going

54
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080

55
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384

Take me to spend it on

57
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Good question

58
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
She look at the penny

59
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
Handed it to her friend

00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,120
And the strange spot it occupies in our economy it is almost worth nothing

64
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400

4 penny

78
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,200
Jacob Goldstein and I headed out on the streets of Manhattan with a pocket full of pennies

79
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Animation

80
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
We have to think

81
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
What's really cheap

82
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,624
Maybe a sheet of paper there's a copy store right across the street from our off

83
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
How much would one piece of plain white paper

84
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,559
We never sell a piece of paper if somebody needs a please explain why you just give it to them

85
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
Alright maybe the guy with the fruit stand on the corner

86
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
What if we wanted to buy one share

87
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
Novant City

The one phone

90
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
Okay it is tough

91
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
Define something for a pet

92
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,383
Honey it's tough to get anyone to think in terms of pennies

93
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
Especially in Midtown Manhattan

94
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Not itchy

95
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:35,967
Key place

96
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,527
But there's one upside of being in Manhattan

97
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,087
That's a Thursdays little weird

98
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
Super specialized stores

99
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Excel

100
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Tiny

101
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Cheap thing

102
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,511
A few blocks from our office in the Fashion District

103
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,071
There's a store that just sells but

104
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
So what is the cheapest

105
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
Button in the sky

106
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
50 Cent

107
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
No

108
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
Art small

109
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
Same block as a button store

110
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,823
Is trim

111
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,639
The carnival this is a store that sells

112
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Tidy

113
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Chinese sequin

114
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
It's like you might

115
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
So on a dress for Mardi Gras

116
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,111
We walked in and we asked Krishna Verna what is the cheapest thing we can get

117
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
Hollywood get a sequin for like a penny

118
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,255
Single sequin

119
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,583
I mean something like let's say a secret like this

120
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:29,471
Dog the bag is $5 or whatever you doing didn't know a single sequence would be like a penny

121
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,055
But if somebody came in with a penny and said open that up

122
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,383
Oh you want to do it now you just told me as a pony

123
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,687
Why not it's not worth my time

124
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:44,831
I mean how many people would have to come in for a penny and a penny and a penny to make my make you pay my rent

125
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
A penny is not worth her time

126
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,231
And I should say here it's not like she's bad dizzy

127
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,047
Mardi Gras already happened we were the only people in the store

128
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Everywhere we went

129
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
Everyone talked about the hassle of this kind of friends

130
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
The button guy said

131
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
The space that a button

132
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,519
Takes up in store cost more than

133
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,615
A lady at the bead store and buy the beads for necklaces

134
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,735
She said the paper for the receipt that you would have to give me would cost her more than a penny

135
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Not sure if that's actually true but

136
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
There aren't super cheap things in the world

137
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,671
A piece of paper with tiny plastic bead

138
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
People just didn't want to sell them to us

139
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,511
Like the lady at 38th Street Hardware

140
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
This right here look at those things come on what is this

141
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
Electrical nut

142
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
That's all

143
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:37,567
It's free no you can make money for free

144
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,431
So why not just sell it for whatever a penny two cents worth

145
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Selling

146
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,039
I rather keep my customer just give it to them make them happy

147
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
The value of the good will she get

148
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
From giving away a little electrical nut

149
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,975
Is worth more than the few sense that you have to sell

150
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
Bottom line

151
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
No one would tell us anything for

152
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,143
But we came as close as you could come

153
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,543
I would be described as what is it 3/16 washer which is you know for people who don't know Hardware a little round thing with a woman

154
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Washer with a hole

155
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,359
Would you put with a screw to help hold it in place

156
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
This is

157
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,199
Brothers hardware and that's Jim Bankston

158
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
One of the brothers

159
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
Holding a tiny little washer

160
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
How much does it

161
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Who said

162
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
$0.02 for this thing

163
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
By far the cheapest thing we found in Manhattan

164
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
Do we know who makes this

165
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Price of Chinese guy

166
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
My name

167
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Om team

168
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Jim

169
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
Beijing China

170
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
What is the name of your company

171
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Nimble

172
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Because I don't

173
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Fasteners Company Limited

174
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
Ningbo exact Fasteners Company Limited of Ningbo China actually just outside Ningbo China

175
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,479
They specialize in making washers just like this one

176
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,783
We called them because we wanted to know

177
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,343
How is it possible to sell this thing for $0.02

178
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
So I'm interested

179
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,207
In washers because they are very inexpensive

180
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,303
And I miss you mean cheap cheap eye treatment

181
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Tavares

182
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Just think of all that has to happen

183
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
To get this washer to this hardware store in Manhattan

184
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
Yep to dig the metal out of the ground

185
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
Turn it into Steel

186
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Yuan to wash

187
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
Packages

188
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
Get it onto a ship

189
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Send it across the world

190
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
And then the United States

191
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,855
There's some guy who has to unload the washers put it on a truck get it to the store unpack it

192
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Put it on the Shelf

193
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
What are those little bit so that I can pick it up

194
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,231
And buy it for two set

195
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Who says who sings

196
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
How is all the spots

197
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Well

198
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
The labor of course

199
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
Is cheap dimple death

200
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,495
The workers at exact Fasteners make about $700 a month

201
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,823
And of course no one has a patent on washer so you have

202
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,431
Lots and lots of companies competing to sell the exact same thing as cheaply as pause

203
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
In the end really

204
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
Watch was just this little

205
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,295
Piece of metal is a commodity

206
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,367
It's Priceless we just goes up and down with the price of Rost

207
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,719
And we left at probably the biggest reason that washers are so

208
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Cheap

209
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Volume

210
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,863
Ningbo exact Fastener Company Limited sells washers by the

211
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
And I don't mean that as a metaphor

212
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,983
The minimum order is one

213
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,567
So if that's the minimum order how many washers is it

214
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
How many washers are there in one

215
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
I asked him to do the math

216
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
720000

217
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Yes

218
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
If you buy a ton of washers

219
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,135
One penny will get you

220
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
Q7

221
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:39,583
Manufacturer transportation to America storage profit for the Importer profit for the brothers who owned the hardware store

222
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
And what you end up with

223
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Might just

224
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,983
Be the smallest transaction that you can make

225
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
In New York City

226
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
1 washer

227
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
2 pennies

228
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
He did go pay Robert

229
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,575
I actually know someone who will take those panties off

230
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,647
We are going to hand over the show to Zoey Chase

231
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
She's just back from hip

232
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,511
And that is where I met a Penny Jones

233
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
This dude has never walk past a penny and not picked it up

234
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,911
In fact he takes his people money his dollar bills

235
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,215
Go to the bank and ask for peace

236
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:22,591
I have $50 that I don't need for anything out right now so I'm going to go in here to the PNC Bank

237
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
Ask for two boxes of pennies

238
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,991
Most people rate that usually change in coins for dollars

239
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
Dvorak

240
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
He does the opposite

241
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
20 years old bushy red beard

242
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,671
The reason Steve collects the pennies is

243
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,279
Not to spend them not to buy one washer at a time or sequence

244
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,607
He wants the pennies because of the copper inside the

245
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,215
You should think of Steve as a very small Speculator on the price of

246
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
Copper

247
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
We looking for is

248
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Killer vintage of

249
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
The 2013 ones

250
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
Mostly the same

251
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
With a copper plating

252
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,503
And they're they're worth $0.01 exactly

253
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,647
That is not a good investment but any penny made before 1982

254
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
Those are the ones he wants

255
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
1982 and prior

256
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,559
They're 95% copper and they're worth about $0.02

257
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
Maybe a little more depending on the price of copper so

258
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,447
I like to pull those out and double my money very slowly

259
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:26,847
Prospecting for copper one old penny at a time there are thousands of people that are doing this

260
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
What are you doing this is

261
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,479
Steve Womack is what's known as a queen rule Hunter

262
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
The coin roll Hunters

263
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
Do you like to go online and show off

264
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
Well guys

265
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
I did it again

266
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,791
Had to go and pick up another box $25 worth of penny rolls

267
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,583
There are dozens

268
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,167
These are all pre-1982 copper pennies

269
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
Some people have these

270
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
Special machines that sort out the

271
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,639
Pre-1982 from the post-1982 second turn off

272
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,991
Funeral papa show

273
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,135
For some people this is almost a full-time job like I talk to this one guy he had something like

274
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
$5,000

275
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
In pennies

276
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,511
Cuz she was hitting Banks 15 times a week

277
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
Divas more of a small-time operator

278
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Get this coin

279
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,423
He brings them home to his fiance and

280
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,751
This is this is kind of a thing that they do at night

281
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
Together in the living room next to each other

282
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
And go through it

283
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
Got going like I'll give her a box

284
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
And I'll take my own box

285
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
U2

286
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
You actually get lucky really quick

287
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:45,183
Almost 2/3 of the penny Steve is pulling out our from 1982 or before

288
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Difference in sound

289
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,839
And these are the zinc pennies that they make now in it

290
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
Sounds completely different

291
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
It sounds like fake money

292
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Once again

293
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Copper

294
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Zinc

295
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Divas collected

296
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:13,087
$475 in old pennies he figures the copper is worth double the face value so that's

297
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
$1,000

298
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
Stacked in boxes in the back of his closet

299
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,511
Now there is this problem with this investment strategy

300
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
Which is right now it is illegal

301
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
To melt these pennies down

302
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
The copper in the pennies is

303
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
Duck bear

304
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Unless

305
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
And this is what these guys are hoping for

306
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,543
The US government kills off the penny

307
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
This is not unreasonable

308
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
Canada got rid of its Penny and

309
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
Canada's now making money

310
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:45,343
The Collector own old pennies melt them down and add them to the Canadian treasure

311
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,439
Politicians and Economist have talked about doing that here because

312
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
It cost more than a penny

313
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
2 mint

314
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
A penny

315
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
It has

316
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
For some years now

317
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,679
So we're losing millions of dollars every year making these things

318
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
Coin roll Hunters

319
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,823
The dream about that day that the penny dies in the US

320
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
If you turn on the computer right now you saw that they'd abolish the penny

321
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
What would you do

322
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
I would probably go by as many boxes as I could

323
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Afford

324
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Deep says

325
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
He would not

326
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
Cash them in right away

327
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
Actually for him

328
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
That day the day they kill the penny

329
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
That is the day that he could collect

330
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
But

331
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
Also a sad day for

332
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,471
When when the pennies are abolished then that's the end of one of your hobbies right there

333
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
Cuz Hey I can only look through so many more and

334
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
It's fun to do

335
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
You would miss them

336
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Yeah yeah I would

337
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
In the meantime thousands of P

338
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,015
People are out there hoarding copper pennies

339
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,855
This one guy out in Portland you rent out some space in an armored

340
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Car Warehouse

341
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:57,279
So he's a regular supply of coins coming in he sorts them with industrial-sized sorting machines and

342
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
Cells off the copper ones online

343
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
That that guys hold job

344
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
That's how many

345
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,471
People are out there betting against the penny

346
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
Old Port penny

347
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Abandon on the street

348
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,663
Orphan in that little bowl by the cash register

349
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,223
Stored in the back of some guy's Closet in Pittsburgh

350
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,271
The little penny is just a waiting

351
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Sad sad and

352
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,879
Our last story that was about one place that still dreams of the penny

353
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
Play some backward people think

354
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
Pennies could change

355
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Everything

356
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
The internet

357
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
On the internet right now

358
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
They're basically two ways people get paid for Kant

359
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
The first is ads

360
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
Put advertisements on their site

361
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:40,799
The second subscription fees you want to read New York Times article or a bunch of them $15 a month

362
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
But there was always a third possibility

363
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,151
A path so far not taken

364
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
The path

365
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Of the penny

366
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
The virtual pet

367
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,783
What if you could as you travel around on

368
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
Passe

369
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
$0.01

370
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
For the stuff you like

371
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,951
You watch a cat video you read a Blog without a recipe

372
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
What if each time you did that

373
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
There is an easy way

374
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,583
Peter pay that person a tiny amount of my

375
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,679
In 1997 some programmers at digital Equipment Corporation

376
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
Actually worked on this idea

377
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,799
Didn't have a secret code name this project it was always called Melissa

378
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
Am i l l i

379
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Cmet

380
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,687
This is Russ Jones who is part of the team

381
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
What was the smallest amount you imagine someone

382
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Pain

383
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
We were

384
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,879
Design the system so that you could do transaction

385
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
It's down to a penny

386
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
Turns out it is a pain to send pennies around the internet

387
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
There are always transaction costs

388
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,607
Between a credit card companies and processors you could end up spending

389
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
$0.30 to send one

390
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Penny

391
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,263
The militant solution was to basically wait until the end of the day of the month or whatever

392
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,567
Add up all the small change

393
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
People were sending

394
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
And pay it to each recipient in a lump

395
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Excited try it out

396
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
They signed up businesses willing to sell stuff

397
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,551
Our spare change virtual guitar

398
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,087
For $0.25 you could

399
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
Play it online

400
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,463
The Oxford English Dictionary also participated for one

401
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Penny Uke

402
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
A very

403
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
Detailed definition of the word basically worked

404
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
But there was this down

405
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
Kind of changed the nature of surfing the web

406
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
People are used to getting stuff for free

407
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
They did not like

408
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
Even small amounts

409
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,615
One of the things we found out was the people

410
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
You know people would get

411
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
As aggravated

412
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
When something went wrong

413
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,039
With a $0.05 purchase is when something went wrong

414
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
In the real world with a $50 purchase

415
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
That wasn't the word I meant to

416
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Look up in the air

417
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
Yeah yeah so it's like

418
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,559
You know I accidentally keyed in the wrong word

419
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,119
And I just lost my penny

420
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
I want my money back

421
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
But it's 17 years later now

422
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
Maybe it's a better time

423
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,359
Internet seems to be changing people are buying stuff for small amount

424
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
English song for 99 cents

425
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
A game for two box

426
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Hawaii not pennies

427
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:00,063
A big Venture Capital firm in Silicon Valley is into this idea

428
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,439
People try to make it work again oh I think it's been changed it could be it would probably the

429
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,279
The biggest change in society occurrence of the internet

430
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,887
This is Lina solsun co-founder and CEO of an online payment system called

431
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Flattered

432
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
Like flattered but

433
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Without the

434
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,519
And flutter gets around that problem that millison

435
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,079
I'm turning web surfing into a kind of

436
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
Unpleasant shopping

437
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,407
How to make paint voluntary like a tip

438
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,479
Basically you load up your flatter account with however much

439
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
Money you want to give away in a month

440
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
10 bucks

441
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
It's whatever

442
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
Then if you see an article or a cat video you like

443
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
You click on a little flattered but

444
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,743
At the end of the month everyone you flattered splits the money you set aside

445
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,583
Actually at the system right now can can do fractions of cents

446
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,167
Fractions of a penny

447
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
To make the case that a penny is worth

448
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,543
It's worth something if there are a lot of people

449
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
The sweetest thing

450
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,479
Rebecca small bleeding stool

451
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:05,343
Play too many small streams forms a large river

452
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,159
Athen how large that River was so far

453
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
We have not managed to to break into

454
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
And mass market yet

455
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
We're not managed to do the revolution we want yet

456
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
What's the largest

457
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,447
Check that you've got to anybody like other people are getting thousands of dollars a month from this

458
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,055
Tens of thousands

459
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
No

460
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:31,455
We will have to talk customer who makes a statement from this I think he gets like

461
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,783
$5,000 or something he's quite public with his number

462
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Amalia

463
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
Penny can actually be a lot in me online work

464
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
If you try to earn money by putting ads on your website

465
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
How much do you get paid for visitor

466
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,303
Well if one person sees that ad

467
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,375
You might get one one-hundredth of one penny

468
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,423
So a whole Penny one cent

469
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
From a certain perspective

470
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,263
It is worth picking them up from the sidewalk

471
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,103
Coming up after the break the most recent effort to get rid of the penny

472

Noel King here with a brief update last year Senator John McCain the late Senator John McCain introduced

483
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Used to Bill

484
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
I actually have a copy of it right here

485
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:32,639
So this is the currency optimization Innovation and National savings Act of 2017

486
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:38,271
That name like all great Bill names makes up an acronym called the coins Act

487
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,319
And I'm going to read a short excerpt from it

488
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Here we go

489
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:47,487
The Secretary of the Treasury shall cease production of any new $0.01 coins for the 10-year.

490
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
Beginning on the date of enactment of this act

491
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,119
New new pennies for 10 years

492
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:58,495
Then maybe in a decade if the sky has not fallen from lack of new pennies

493
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,335
Maybe Congress decides to extend the Hiatus and minting new pen

494
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
That was John McCain's bill

495
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,943
He introduced it and then

496
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Nothing happen

497
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
New Committee hearing

498
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271

Nothing
