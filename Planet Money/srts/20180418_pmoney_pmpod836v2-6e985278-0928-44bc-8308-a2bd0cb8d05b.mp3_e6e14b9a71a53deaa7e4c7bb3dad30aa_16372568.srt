1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04,608
One of the things I like best about being able to watch TV online

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,912
Is it I can pay a small fee

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,704
Skipping bombarded

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,728
I think like

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,776
Can help my son

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,056
Are you God

7
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,920
Mini truck.

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,344
Local car commercials

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
I think we can all agree there

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416
Pretty Tarot

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
Yeah I think so

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,536
I mean they're they're terrible but they're so entertaining

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,584
This is Flora Lichtman

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,632
But they're not held in by the bounds of

15
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,240
Yeah good taste

16
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,080
Florida hosts the podcast every little thing

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,896
And these terrible car ads

18
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
It's something she's been looking into on behalf of a listener which is what they do at every little thing they answer questions sent

19
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,320
10 by listeners

20
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,392
And when they ask people to submit their burning

21
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,416
Questions

22
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
Amongst

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,536
The many things that lister's could have submitted like you know

24
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
How do magnets work

25
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,352
How big is the universe

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
One of the questions

27
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
They got was this

28
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
All right

29
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:17,568
My coworkers and I were having a conversation today about local car commercials

30
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,848
And we're wondering

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
Why are they all so

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,504
This is Jamie Cox The Listener who submitted the question

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
And Chee

34
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
Is right

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
But it's not just the car ads

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,952
It's our bad it's that they're like consistently bad in the same kinds of ways

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
In fact as Flora was looking into this

38
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,096
She noticed that there's actually kind of a pattern to the awfulness

39
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Yes

40
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,912
And it seems to be

41
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
First usually a dude and dude with deals

42
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
He often calls himself

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Crazy

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Not a label

45
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,504
That's what these guys called themselves and

46
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,064
This dude with DLC says he's crazy

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,648
Usually then prove that by invoking some kind of

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
Terrible analogy

49
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
Ford told me about

50
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
Particularly bad one

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
I don't know

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,584
I should say I should just send you the link but

53
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:18,240
Okay here we go

54
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
Actually showing

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
A big hairy

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Your belly and then it like

57
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
Six-pack smaller belly

58
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Weight does he want to be

59
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
Unstuffed

60
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Is that the goal

61
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
He likes his lot stuff

62
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
With people are cars

63
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
It's okay but preferably by the end of the day he's got the six-pack I think you're applying

64
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,472
More logic to it and it deserves possibly but yeah sure

65
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:54,336
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

66
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616

68
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,712
The patient zero up bad car commercial

And we ask

70
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
How did the spread

71
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
How is it

72
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
Did someone created this

73
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,880
Advertising model that is so bad

74
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
And then everyone else said yeah we should definitely also dude

75
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:16,352
Dancer that we turn over the show to Flora Lichtman and the podcast every little thing

76
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
And learn

77
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
There might be a method to this madness

88
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Florida.

89
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
You find us someone I did

90
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
There's actually one guy you can trade

91
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
Yes there is

92
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
A locust

93
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,160
Classical that Steven Gilbert he wrote a book about the history of car sales

94
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
He's a historian

95
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
And a lover of Latin

96
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
Now he wasn't sewage era

97
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,095
But there's an actual specific person

98
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
Who created this

99
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Forum

100
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Are

101
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Hysteria

102
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
The originator

103
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
The crazy used car ad

104
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
One person

105
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
One person

106
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
These bad ads

107
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
We can blame

108
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Enrollment

109
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
Otherwise known

110
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
As mad

111
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
I do understand that my

112
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,671
Steven told me you actually want to start in a time before use

113
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Scarce

114
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
A time that might surprise you

115
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
Yes there was

116
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
Ammoman

117
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,839
A prelapsarian moment

118
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
Prelapsarian

119
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,679
Meaning the biblical time before the fall of Man

120
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
Eidetic moment

121
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,799
When car salesmen were actually

122
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
What car sales worldwide

123
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
I need to be in the time of BS

124
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
Before sleazeball

125
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
Car salesmen were respect

126
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
People thought they were just knowledge

127
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
They were trustworthy

128
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
This was back in the early night

129
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
When the Model T came on the market

130
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,863
A few years later it gets mass-produced and mass production baguettes Mass consumption because

131
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
Cars get cheap or at least

132
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Cheap enough that

133
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
A car becomes available to the

134
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Middle class

135
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
It's no longer luxury

136
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,407
By the 1920s those New Model Tees are now a used Model T

137
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,967
That means even cheaper cars

138
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
And that becomes a problem

139
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
For new car

140
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,599
They were a sufficient number of used cars

141
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,671
That people had to be induced

142
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
To buy new cars

143
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
It feels obvious now

144
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
But back then this was a new problem

145
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Car Zara

146
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
Expensive enough and durable enough

147
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,215
Why would you pay a ton more for a new car if your old ones

148
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Still runs

149
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
So car dealerships adapt

150
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,103
They start offering trade-ins buying back cars

151
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
And now they sell not just new cars but used one

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
Giving birth

153
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
To the used car sales

154
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
And very quickly

155
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
They leave the parking lot of

156
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,743
The bad reputation then a car dealers

157
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
Begins to take deep root

158
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
In the 1920s

159
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,447
Selling used cars Inspire some less than honorable sales tax

160
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
On the part of the used car dealers

161
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
They were from the very beginning

162
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Considered

163
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Sleaziest

164
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
At least honest

165
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
The bottom

166
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
I'll be automobile biz

167
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,503
And that's because negotiation is baked into you

168
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,087
Used car sales and negotiation in which the seller is at an advantage

169
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
It's something Economist call information asymmetry

170
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,999
One person knows more than the other which gives the person in the know in this case

171
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
Used car dealer

172
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
A huge advance

173
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
In human terms

174
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,887
It's a situation where you feel like you might get

175
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,775
There's a famous economics paper all about this Theory and used cars called the market for Less

176
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
I mean you don't know where that thing's been

177
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
It could have

178
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Literally

179
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Been driven off a cliff and then

180
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Reassembled

181
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
That's Jamie Again The Listener who brought us this

182
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,807
Jimmy's right you have no way of knowing

183
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
The car's history or condition

184
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
But the used car salesman does

185
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,671
Tino's the used car seat

186
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
Dirty and otherwise

187
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,119
So used car dealer see the juicy Apple of information AC

188
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
Tree and take a big old bite

189
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
They become notorious for coming up at Ric

190
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
The hide the car's fault

191
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
For a while

192
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
It was even legal

193
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
Legal

194
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
To roll back

195
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
The speedometer on the odometer

196
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,319
Is a long as you rolled it back to zero

197
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:57,439
Other tricks included etching Treads into balding tires to make them look younger

198
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,999
Using sawdust or heavy oil to mask

199
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,607
Mechanical problems spiking gasoline with ether to boost performance

200
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
And within a few decades

201
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,727
We go from trustworthy new car salesman

202
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
Just like talking odometer roll

203
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
Used car salesman

204
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
Most people would probably consider this

205
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
Sleazy reputation an obstacle

206
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
A minor

207
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,039
But one used car dealer

208
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
Seem to find inspiration in it

209
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,207
Michael Jamie are listener to introduce her to this

210
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,255
Please inspired car dealer because

211
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
He is the man we can play

212
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Boj

213
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
Comparable local car ads

214
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,983
Who was it

215
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
The originator

216
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
Of the crazy used car ad

217
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Is Earl month

218
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
Better now

219
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Asthmatic

220
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
Is that what you said like

221
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
God given name Madman

222
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
Note to self given name

223
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
And here's his deal

224
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,879
Months is a used car dealer in California in the night

225
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,695
He has this idea to buy cars for cheap

226
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,999
In the Midwest and then sell them in

227
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,727
And he teams up with this advertising Mogul Michael

228
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
Sure

229
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,079
And it is these two who developed the madman

230
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Persona

231
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
The Madman Behind the madness

232
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Yeah exactly

233
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
Their strategy was to take the obvious move

234
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
IP address

235
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
And do the app

236
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
On purpose

237
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
You have to distinguish itself

238
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Hugo the office

239
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
Daisy Cusack

240
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
That's media story and Martin Castillo

241
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,399
Any ideas that rather than running away from the terrible used car salesman persona

242
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
Run towards

243
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,263
Earl attebury Berry larger-than-life personality so it sure thought

244
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,055
Your eccentric you'll Wild

245
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
You're a Madman

246
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
So they built an entire ad strategy around months is self-proclaimed

247
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
And craziness

248
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
Munson the attics

249
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
Higher the studio that makes Bugs Bunny to make them a logo which is basically just a picture of months drawn to look like

250
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Napoleon

251
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,511
Which fits the image they're going for it always been one of the

252
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
Cliches that if you were crazy you thought you were Napoleon

253
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Jamie

254
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
Are you buy a computer

255
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
I want you to look at

256
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
Logo

257
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
I can look on my phone

258
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Oh wait there is

259
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,615
What's a drawing of months as Napoleon wearing classic Napoleon outfit

260
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
Like then

261
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
But also he's

262
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
Strangely in red PJs

263
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
Yeah I was I was thinking that that look

264
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,087
A little bit like a onesie

265
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:38,975
Edmonds himself the actual person not the cartoon also appears as the madman in ads

266
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
Pictures

267
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Google it

268
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Mad

269
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
Man

270
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Months

271
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,215
I see him next to a billboard I want to give them away but misses months won't let me

272
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,775
She's crazy

273
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
Yeah like your name is literally Madman

274
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,431
But he also it's also like you can tell he's not actually

275
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,503
A Madman hits like what you would imagine a Madman

276
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
To be like a caricature of a Madman

277
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
Yeah it's like I kinda want to know what

278
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
He would like in real life

279
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,695
Well I can tell you the answer to that

280
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Right after this

281
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,071

So mad

291
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Didn't just invent

292
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
Bad car ads

293
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,887
He also patented design for an early TV and in fact

294
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
Names his daughter TV

295
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
But spelled t e

296
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Vee

297
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,079
He also invents The Four Track cassette which inspires the 8-track

298
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
Admonsters inventing method

299
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,479
Is kind of brilliant it actually gets named after him people call it munsing

300
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
And munsing was basically

301
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
Taking a component

302
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,975
Trying to strip it down to its Bare Essentials to prune away what he felt were the non-essential portions of

303
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Of the components

304
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
This is Media historian Martin Castillo

305
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Any ideas

306
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,655
The cheapest version of Saint TV is the one with the fewest part

307
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
Someone switches

308
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Start taking away party

309
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:32,127
Until we got to the point where he clipped off one wire and then if the set went dark you said well I guess we have to keep that one

310
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
He's kind of a diss inventor

311
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,015
And it is time he's also kind of a papaya

312
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Like

313
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:44,415
Bob Hope makes fun of him

314
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
The three

315
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:51,071
Stooges make fun of him the money over in that manner

316
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,423
His used car lot becomes an attraction on Hollywood tours

317
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,263
The same car lot where a new genre of car advertising

318
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
Is born

319
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
I want to get a sense of who Earl months was you can sort of understand why he took the madman advertising route

320
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
But why did other car dealers follow suit

321
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:15,135
Some experts we talked to say it comes down to the most basic goal of advertising be memorable

322
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,439
And if he says or anything they are hard to

323
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Forget

324
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
Any memorable sometimes turns these car dealers into local celebrities so some experts told us that the ads are

325
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,911
Ego thing they bring some amount of Fame

326
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,007
They also said it just comes down to money these kinds of ads are cheap

327
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
To make like months is stripped on TV

328
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,871
Stripping down a commercial to say

329
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
A stuffed belly doesn't cost that much

330
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
And more importantly

331
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
It seems to have worked

332
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
Jamie Arliss Oregon

333
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Does it

334
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:51,231
Wolferman's it does seem to have he was reported to have sold over 70 million dollars worth of cars in

335
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
In a single year

336
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,095
In present-day money that's like over half a billion dollars

337
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Oh my gosh

338
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
But yeah that's

339
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
Really impressive

340
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Any approach

341
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
Spread for months in the 40s

342
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
The Cal Worthington in

343
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
60s heels

344
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
Two Electronics dealer crazy

345
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
Eddie in the 70

346
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,783
80s

347
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,183
And now it's kind of everywhere

348
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,767
Jamie our listeners actually works in marketing so I asked her

349
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
Does she think this is a good strategy I mean

350
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
He did something right

351
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,911
And it must be working if it's

352
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Got on

353
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
Since the 40s

354
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
But the thing is like

355
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
I just

356
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,847
I don't think I would want to trust a person like that

357
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
Steven Gilbert thinks that's

358
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Kind of the point

359
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Here's his theory

360
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
The whole thing is to

361
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Create

362
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
A

363
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
A circus atmosphere

364
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
An atmosphere

365
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
Excitement and atmosphere of unsureness

366
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
Atmosphere

367
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
In a way

368
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
Help balance out that information

369
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Asymmetry

370
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,607
Where the dealer knows so much more than you about the

371
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
The car

372
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
Because if the dealer is a mad

373
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Steven stereo

374
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
It helps you feel in some odd way

375
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
More comfortable like

376
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
Sure he knows more about

377
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
I'm saner than
