1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:06,144
We thought that we had heard every kind of story about a dying small town trying to say

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,448
And then we went

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,984
To Colquitt Georgia

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,800
Leaving water in car

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,104

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,176
Coco has a population of about 2000

7
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,504
It claims to be the mayhaw capital of the world

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,576
Met high is a kind of berry that people like to make jam out of

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,624
And this city feels like it pops

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,184
Straight out of a book by the children's author

11
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464

She is in fact in her eighties

52
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
She just has this like

53
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808

Giant smile and a head full

55
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
Of what someone describes me as

56
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
Bright red

00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
Little Orphan Annie hair

58
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,560
Joy was a social worker she was born and raised and retired and Coke

59
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
Emma's place is everything to her

60
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
The way she talks about Colquitt

61
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
She says things that sounds like but are not

62
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,520
Quotes from like some famous Southern novel

63
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,384
I lived my childhood sitting in a mimosa tree reading

64
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
Sitting in a mimosa tree

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
Pretty curtains

66
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
But since Joy was a little girl she's watched Colquitt died the same slow death as a lot of America's rural City

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
Starting around World War II

68
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
Farm equipment. Better

69
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
Low-skilled farming jobs started to die

70
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Pen manufacturer

71
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Factories went

72
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Overseas

73
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Colquitt sewing play

74
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Plant closed down

75
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
Population

76
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
Shrunk

77
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Shrunk

78
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,288
Is that undercurrent of well are we going to

79
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
Survive you know what is

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Future for this town

81
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,920
Yeah that must be scary feeling

82
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Feeling like

83
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
Abdomen and death

84
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,808
The stores are boarded up and no no cars parked

85
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
They know people

86
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
And then Joy Jinks

87
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
Stumbled across a bizarre way

88
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
4 Colquitt Street

89
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
The town would write

90
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
Stage and star in

91
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,936
An original musical hello and welcome

92
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
The planet money I'm Kenny Malone the idea modern idea let's build a town

93
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Town around me

94
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,432
But 25 years ago before the books in the TED Talks

95
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
It was just a crazy idea

96
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,016
Play on the show what happened to a

97
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,344
Tiny peanut farming town where things got so bad

98
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,416
They brought in the big city director to try and save themselves

99
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
With music

100
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
And awarding at there is

101
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
One very bad

102
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Swear words in it

103
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
In fact

104
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
That word almost

105
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Ended

106
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Degrate Colquitt Georgia

107

115
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
Around 1990

116
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,928
Joy Jinks went to leadership

117
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
Retreat in Upstate New

118
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
Was totally unrelated to theater

119
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
But at this retreat

120
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
Was none other

121
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
Then Richard

122
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,727
Gear my name is Richard Owen gear and I use my middle name so you don't think you're talking to Pretty Woman actor

123
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,799
I mean to be fair I don't know what pretty woman actress middle name is

124
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
Yeah if it isn't Owen

125
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,407
Richard Owen Gere is also an actor

126
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,455
But he's primarily a theater director

127
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
Are people disappointed when you show up and you're not that Richard Gere thank you you just stolen my favorite line which

128
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,183
I'm a disappointment wherever I go and they laughed just like that

129
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
And we're off to the

130
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,791
Back in 1990 Richard Gere was a grad

131
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:54,911
He was getting his PhD in performance studies you know like a fancy theater degree that comes

132
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
The splash of anthropology

133
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
And that is why grads do

134
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
Was working through it

135
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Efficient

136
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Really

137
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
That he was dying to try out

138
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
He thought

139
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
If a group

140
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Full of non perfect

141
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
Collected their communities

142
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
In those stories on

143
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
Onstage that this

144
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Could be

145
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
A powerful

146
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:18,719
And especially from a part of the world that was thought to be a throwaway

147
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
That's what the rest of the country thought

148
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,607
And I knew if they could see something radically different

149
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
That's theater

150
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,935
Is Richard Gere's at this retreat in New York

151
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
He's talking about his

152
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
Is Big Ideas

153
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
Is when this woman

154
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Here's him

155
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Incomes up to

156
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
She said that

157
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
Her community

158
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,431
Was dying and

159
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,831
Her community wasn't able to get industry to come in and we try to get some factories in here that

160
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
Catwoman of course was Joyce

161
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,207
But we realize nobody was coming here

162
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:56,351
But we wanted to do something to celebrate who we are is the people left behind

163
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,423
Words that I spoke to her other than hello or something like that

164
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
I said

165
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
If you do a play about

166
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
Your community stories

167
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,407
I'd love to direct it

168
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,735
Now it is important to know that at this point

169
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,575
Joy was not thinking of this project as an economic driver

170
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,903
In her mind this was a celebration of the people of coffee

171
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,671
But you were

172
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
Sticking it out in a city that was being left behind

173
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
Sir Richard fluid to Tallahassee Florida

174
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
Enjoy pick them up at the airport and they drove to call

175
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,703
It literally crashed into a log truck on their way there they were okay

176
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,359
And the main reason for this trip was that Julie needed Richard to go before the town Arts Council to get support to do this

177
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
No Richard pitch

178
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
Siri

179
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Was very simple

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
We're going to collect oral histories

181
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
We're going to Stage those as vignettes

182
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
But you know

183
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
Richard was a grad student

184
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
And

185
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
He kept talking in this

186
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
Jogging that we had no idea what it is

187
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
He's talking about you know you wake up

188
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
PhD jargon

189
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,399
Like a goose wi-lan you know theater of the oppressed

190
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
Too too smart

191
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Too smart for us

192
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,335
And according to Joy it was during this pitch

193
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,895
That Richard started talking about economic

194
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,455
Is Joy wrong that you

195
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
Had the idea of this as an economic driver

196
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Early on

197
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
No I probably said that

198
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,415
I'm no I'm I'm sure I did

199
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
It would grow the pie

200
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Is he said

201
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,791
It would bring in people and

202
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
And create a bigger economic base

203
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
And you guys were thinking what

204
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
What

205
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
What

206
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,079
It's a wonder we went along with this idea but I guess we was so desperate we did

207
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,895
The Arts Council gave Richard the green light

208
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
And it started to raise money

209
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,503
Yeah they sold sausage and biscuits at farm shows

210
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
They held a bake sale in the town

211
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,599
Square foot most effective of all

212
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
The apply for Grants

213
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Come on

214
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Doesn't mean you don't know how to raise money

215
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,279
End it was agreed that the name for the show was going to be

216
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Swamp

217
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Gravy

218
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Swamp

219
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Gravy

220
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
Now look we could explain this to you

221
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
Why would we

222
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
When we have someone like

223
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:14,335
Swamp gravy three to four people can't catch a lot of fish and they have to eat something else

224
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,151
That again is fire chief Craig Tully and he says

225
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:22,527
People that make swamp gravy on the side of the creek when they went fishing

226
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
And just a little bit of Grease

227
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
And whatever you

228
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
Clean out the refrigerator

229
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Taters

230
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Okra

231
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
Korn whatever you want to put in there

232
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
Covfefe Friday move to Dripping put in there

233
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
It was good stuff

234
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
The Iliad

235
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
That's where it started to get out that the

236
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
The town was going to put on a play

237
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Chief Tully

238
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
Was not a fan

239
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
I'm not going to say stupid

240
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:51,711
Silly silly would would be more the word and he's got like a couple of pretty good singers about them

241
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:57,087
First of all this idea you're going to make plays out of Colquitt oral history stories

242
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
I didn't understand

243
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,463
Why people would pay money to come see stories that they already knew

244
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,559
I mean if I got time to go do that I got time to go fishing that's kind of what I was looking

245
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Speaking of

246
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
The swamp gravy

247
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Swamp gravy

248
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
I come a beating swamp gravy and iWatch

249
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
You know when though

250
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,823
Listen I wasn't in the Menards

251
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
I was in the majority

252
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Because nobody in car

253
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
Really supportive

254
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
The swamp gravy dissenters could be divided into two

255
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
There was the chief Tully camp this is

256
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Is a dumb idea

257
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
And then there was a group with

258
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
A deeper citic

259
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
At the project got going

260
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,791
A team of people including Richard we're out and about town interviewing

261
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,583
People collecting oral histories

262
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
They were going to become the show

263
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,215
And it was around this idea that Joy started to hear somewhere

264
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,031
I remember that people

265
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
Started saying

266
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,895
To my friends and therefore to me

267
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
That we don't really want to do this week

268
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
Don't really need to do this

269
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
Because

270
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,807
If we start telling our old

271
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Bad

272
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
Bad stuff

273
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
But you know it might stir up trouble in our community

274
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,047
When you live in a little town you know all the dirt that's happened for a lot of years

275
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
And you're not pray about it

276
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,167
What were the kinds of stories that people

277
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
We don't

278
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
We don't want that to get out

279
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
This pain

280
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Political stories

281
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
About

282
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
Dirty crooked politics

283
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,223
There was stories about when this town was really like a West

284
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Stringtown

285
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
And then this been race

286
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Conflict in

287
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
You know we had two colored fountains in the wipe down

288
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,463
The colored waiting rooms in the White waiting room

289
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:44,095
And so people were afraid that something might be told that would really be detrimental to the

290
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
While we were in Colquitt Noel I stopped in

291
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
The public library

292
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,031
And there are oral histories written down there

293
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,615
Including some of the transcripts from the swamp gravy interview

294
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,943
This one's about making moonshine and getting ready to get up to the elderly

295
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,503
And it's a good illustration of this concern

296
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
If you start interviewing

297
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
People about old stories

298
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
All kinds of stuff is go

299
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:11,487
Some of it is totally Charming there are stories in there about Dad dressing up like Santa Claus

300
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Stories about ghosts

301
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
So many jokes

302
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
And then there are

303
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
Deeply troubling stories

304
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
Including an account

305
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,191
From a man whose earliest memory was Whitney

306
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,031
The population of Colquitt is about half white

307
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Aflac

308
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
And as much as Richard Gere wanted to

309
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Stages show that help

310
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
The city confront

311
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
It's past

312
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
He also didn't feel like this was the right

313
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:38,879
Time to do that baton was already struggling the show with a long shot to begin with and to swamp gravy Wood Ave

314
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:45,279
Avoid call quits most difficult stories if it went well if they got a second 1/3 show maybe then swamp

315
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:51,679
Pretty good start to deal with more challenging material

316
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,007
The show was starting to come together the stories have been collected

317
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
It hired a playwright

318
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
Ditch those stories into a script

319
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
There was a music team they were writing original songs

320
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
Swamp gravy was going to be an hour long

321
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,503
It will be held at the elementary school auditorium

322
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,855
Anastasia would be like old timey down on the farm soap hay bales

323
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Overalls

324
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
Anycast was all okay

325
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
SeaWorld volunteer

326
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Cersei roll amateur

327
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:21,375
Was there anything surprising was there anyone where you were like my God she has a beautiful voice and we didn't know well

328
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
We had two African-American women

329
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
That knew more about

330
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Comedy in

331
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Theater

332
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
Then most people on Broadway

333
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
One of the women was a house

334
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
Keeper the other was a factory worker from the next town

335
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,967
Then you exactly how to pause

336
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,783
To do the punchline they're also kids

337
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Kerry seems like nobody's business

338
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,159
There was an ambulance dispatcher with an amazing voice

339
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,975
She would get the big song on opening night Richard was direct

340
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Joy was

341
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,583
I kind of producing I guess who's making sure that things were going smoothly in

342
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
Shooting Richard from a lot of the negative feelings

343
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,215
And up to this point Richard had mostly avoided

344
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
Causing those negative

345
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:04,127
One of the biggest concerns Richard had when he agreed to parachute in indirect the show

346
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,687
We said he'd mess up and get run out of town

347
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
Which may have sounded like some overblown Dramatics

348
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
Fear

349
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
Until

350
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
The inside

351
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,135
Well it was a week before we were

352
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
To open our first

353
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Show

354
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,743
If we were in the schoolhouse Auditorium

355
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
And there were people on the stage

356
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
And in doing this

357
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,167
Show with in crunch mode it was time for rehearsal

358
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Richard looked up

359
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
And not all of the ACT

360
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,591
And Richard just let it all out he went into his a professional

361
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
Theater director

362
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
Mode

363
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
The state of mine

364
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
And he kind of

365
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
Blurted out

366
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
Whatever

367
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
And what was whatever

368
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,207
It was bad it was it was it was a bad it was bad it was hell or damn

369
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
Whatever those ones are like the lowest

370
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
In the hierarchy of squares so it might have been that low

371
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
I think probably was

372
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Because I mean we're not used to people

373
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Swearing

374
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
In front of chilled

375
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
You don't do that

376
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
The South

377
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
There was some debate as to what you said

378
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,687
Really to just for that I don't think there's much debate about what I said but

379
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
That's fine for the record

380
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
The offending

381
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
Rephrase

382
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
Was what

383
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
I don't think it was a phrase I just said

384
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:24,255
Bach at the top of my lungs and started kicking grain bags and

385
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Bales of hay

386
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
And

387
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
Then looked up and the next thing that I saw was

388
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,935
All the men in the room were coming at

389
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
Converging

390
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,543
And all the women and children were fleeing out the doors

391
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,383
And the men came up and said you better get yourself out of town right now

392
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,711
We are tar and feather you get on a plane and never come

393
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
They said those words to you

394
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,087
Absolutely and so the cast walked out

395
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,927
And at that point in time Richie was staying at our house

396
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,767
Richard and I sat on the sofa in my living room all weekend

397
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
Just about in tears

398
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,399
What's going to happen we had lost everything

399
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
How long did the

400
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
Boycott last

401
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
All weekend

402
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,615
And and I think it was maybe it was on Sunday afternoon or Monday the Baptist

403
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Preacher

404
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
Call this together

405
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,759
And he negotiated a truce

406
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,855
And Richard apologized profusely I mean

407
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,183
He was practically down on his knees begging forgiveness

408
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
And that's quite a

409
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
Stretch for

410
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
Theater director

411
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
This project meant everything

412
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
But I just about lost

413
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,703
Every time I start to get annoyed with folks

414
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
I remember what I did that day

415
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
I just forgot

416
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
For I was with who I was

417
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
I got to go

418
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
It is

419
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,039
Saturday October 10th 1992 the premiere of swamp gravy

420
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,111
This is video first showing the lobby of the elementary

421
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
Preschool you can see

422
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
Is the fundraising quilt

423
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
There's somebody selling swamp gravy t-shirt

424
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
And then

425
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
We're in the auditorium

426
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Places

427
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,607
So there was probably about 300 people

428
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
And but they were local people

429
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,215
You were where you where were you in the audience

430
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,335
Throwback I was stand front near front

431
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
The stage is dark

432
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:23,807
And when the lights come up there about 10 people in old timey Bonnets and overalls

433
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
In the entire room

434
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Is silent

435
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
For just a moment

436
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
And what were you feeling

437
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
Just kind of been treated like what was going to happen

438
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
You know

439
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
How is this going to come out

440
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,911
The show starts with reflection on Chris

441
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,191
Columbus it was

442
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,495
Premiering on Columbus Day weekend after all

443
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
Columbus had an idea

444
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,663
Now there were those that held that the Earth was flat

445
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
And to be totally honest with you

446
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
This is

447
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
Pretty tough to watch

448
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,575
It doesn't seem like the crowd

449
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
Intuitive all

450
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,671
Comenity still awkward when is Columbus section

451
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
The new section begins

452
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,303
Icon from Tall Pines and short fuses

453
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
I found some Big Valley

454
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:12,703
Subaru hard to hear but every actor is saying I come from

455
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,751
And then like a line like I come from

456
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Deep down in the sea

457
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:20,383
I come from all dressed up with no place to go all dressed up with no place to

458
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,199
And still it is really hard to tell if the body is

459
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Is getting this

460
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
At all

461
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
And then

462
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,087
I come from a cannon with no stop lights

463
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Hot girl from shut up and

464
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,951
Best first

465
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Big laugh

466
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,071
And you can see the actors on stage break character and they start smiling

467
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:39,839
Kind of like

468
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
Okay thank God maybe this is going to work after

469
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,983
It's okay if I fast forward a little bit just kicked a couple places

470
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
Parts of highlights

471
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,223
There's a song about starting work at the

472
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
The crack of dawn

473
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
There was a sketch about caucus

474
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
Quotes famous berries

475
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
They are good for

476
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Good for digestion

477
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,351
I heard it with liver trouble there was a story about

478
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Two girls

479
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,983
Stealing a bottle of herbal Elixir from their mom and then getting very can

480
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
Lydia e Pinkham tonic

481
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
For ladies

482
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151
Lady E Pinkham if you ever heard this

483
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Story about

484
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Women used

485
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,479
Did take it for anemia

486
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
But

487
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,575
The story was that there's a baby in every bottle

488
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
What what

489
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:40,255
What it means is the woman would get built up and she get pregnant again

490
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,863
I don't know but one of us is going to have this baby

491
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
But the Show Stoppers

492
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
Where the closing song

493
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,919
This is Annette Miller the ambulance

494
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,671
How she was Young Band

495
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
Weren't we all

496
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
You know Iris

497
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Experience

498
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
But most people was what they had seen

499
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Add a scoop

500
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,895
And you need to have them on this

501
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,663
States

502
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Bombing

503
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
In such a

504
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
An almost

505
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,527
Professional way

506
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
And it was

507
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,343
Was so far beyond our wives

508
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Expectation

509
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
They stood up and gave us a standing ovation

510
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:50,911
People with Blown Away

511
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,215
And it made it all worthwhile

512
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,055
Could you clap harder than you ever clapped in your life

513
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,407
Can you cry did you how did you react

514
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,455
Is cheering and beaming from ear-to-ear

515
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
Clapping very much

516
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,911
Let's Circle up you die.

517
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
It is now

518
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,519
25 years later and swamp gravy is still going

519
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,615
This is a rehearsal for this year's version of the show

520
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Quiet place

521
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
So this is

522
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Kenny and Noel

523
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
For the evening

524
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,367
Just don't worry about them

525
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,903
Not the school auditorium NE

526
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,439
This is cotton

527
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
Halt it is

528
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
A permanent venue built

529
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
For swamp grass

530
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
And it is

531
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
An old Cotton Warehouse

532
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
Has been converted into a

533
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
A giant state-of-the-art

534
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,567
Alright.

535
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,919
The director you're hearing is obviously not Richard

536
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:11,807
Richard is moved on and help loads of other places start things like swamp gravy and has the show mature

537
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,623
It has dealt with some of Colquitt stuffer realities

538
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,903
They tackled

539
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,928
Sexual abuse

540
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
Racism

541
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
They even had a sketch about murder

542
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,816
But it's still overall Maura celebration than it is

543
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,888
The director now is Kate Willis

544
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,216
Cook she's a 35 year old former theater major who moved

545
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
To Colquitt for this job

546
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,592
The show's writer is a local kid who grew up acting and swamp gravy

547
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
He moved to New York

548
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,712
He worked on Broadway and then he came back home because of swamp

549
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
1

550
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,448
So now we are not

551
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,520
Just here because swamp gravy is still going we are here because

552
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,056
Full right economic

553
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Case studies

554
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,384
About swamp gravy and remember 25 years ago

555
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
This was the part of Richard Gere's

556
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,504
But even Joy Jinx was not so sure about

557
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
Joy told us she remembers the

558
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
The exact moment

559
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
She realized

560
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
This thing could have a monetary

561
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
After that first show was a

562
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,952
The success locally

563
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,744
They decided to put the show on again

564
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
It took a couple years but

565
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
New stories new songs

566
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,352
And somehow

567
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,936
Word traveled about this small town putting on a

568
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
Surprisingly great show

569
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
And into caucus Town Square

570
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
Play Massive

571
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Charter bus

572
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Southern coaches

573
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
Was the brand

574
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
It's a brand of the two of us

575
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
So you see that

576
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:49,344
And what do you think God really exciting must be happening in Congress

577
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
But it was your play

578
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
They were swamped

579
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,768
Eventually swamp gravy became profitable

580
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,584
And along the way swamp gravy has been invited to

581
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
Perform at the Kennedy Center in Washington

582
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,288
DC they got to perform at the freaking Olympics when they were held in Atlanta and every season there are about two dozen for 4

583
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Performances of swamp gravy

584
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,360
Many of those fell out

585
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,944
And the vast majority of tickets are bought by people from out of town

586
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,480
Colquitt County Miller

587
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Brought in

588
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
Roughly seven and a half million dollars

589
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
Indirect tourism

590
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
Some spending last year

591
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,536
A lot happens if we went on a little drive around town with

592
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,584
Localendar here in the car

593
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,216
Lest you forget what day it is while you're driving

594
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,496
You're very busy huh

595
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,312
Oh yeah what is drive we started to realize that

596
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,896
Because of swamp gravy there's something totally backwards about call

597
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,736
Yeah most cities you got developers and entrepreneurs whatever

598
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,296
Making money and then they are the ones that

599
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
Support the Arts

600
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
In Colquitt

601
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
It is completely

602
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,720
Flip last little ones

603
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
This playground were there bunch

604
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,584
Toddling about the project of the Arts

605
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,984
Cancel it's an early learning site daycare center and it keeps happening we drive past this charming

606
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,824
Old building called Market on the Square also is a project

607
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
Of the Arts

608
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:18,432
Is a retail incubator space owned and operated by the Arts

609
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:25,088
And the apartments above that space renovated owned and rent it out by the Arts Council

610
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,648
The one with the ghost miserly at one point

611
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,696
Owned and operated by the Arts count

612
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
Something I want to say that I've got

613
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Dig out

614
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
StarTalk

615
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,608
Just start talking

616
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
I think

617
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
What his

618
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,240
Come to the full gram about swamp gravy

619
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
Is

620
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,336
Not only the economic benefit to the town

621
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,664
But I think the real basic thing that is

622
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
It's given this tan

623
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,992
Is the new a Feeling

624
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,272
We're somebody

625
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,808
We have arrived

626
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
We are important in the scheme of

627
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Things

628
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,952
And that you cannot underestimate

629
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,512
Take for granted the idea that Arts

630
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Play a role in helping a city

631
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
It's a pretty popular ID

632
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
Hazel Reid

633
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,448
About the creative class in the value of building a community around smart

634
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:18,080
Part of the reason swamp gravy has worked is that Colquitt figured all of this out

635
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
First

636
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,176
It got there first and now it gets to be Georgia's

637
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,224
Official Folklife play

638
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
And of course

639
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,064
There can only be one official Folklife play

640
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,624
I'm not going to say I just was

641
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,208
I never been scared to say what I think you will recall fire chief

642
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Chief Craig Tully swamp gravy

643
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,864
Loudest critics lot of people just think it don't say it I'm going to tell you what to think even as the show group

644
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
As the tour bus

645
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Just came to town

646
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,728
He still refused to see it he just did not want to go

647
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
And then one day

648
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,568
She gets a call that something is wrong down at cotton

649
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
Maybe someone smells

650
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
Smokey can't remember exact

651
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,920
But he had to go over

652
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,480
He gets there nothing actually is wrong

653
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,016
And the play is going on at

654
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,576
That's normal I stuck my head in there

655
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
And

656
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:06,464
You know you look and you see the people that you're know who are up there doing things that you didn't know they could do

657
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Active

658
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
The lighting

659
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,304
The actors

660
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
The music

661
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,864
I think the music

662
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,912
County kind of caught me to

663
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,984
Chip Kelly wants to show us just how much he has come around

664
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
He walks me out of his office

665
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Is Into the Fire

666
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,872
Are cheap now we're staring at the side of one of your fire trucks

667
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,176
He's pointing to the official crest

668
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
Abbey carpet fire

669
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,992
Fire on left side wrist

670
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
Do you want to ride

671
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,784
And in the center

672
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
We have a just

673
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,600
A painted fire helmet

674
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,928
Any we have home of swamp gravy as in

675
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:39,488
At the center of the fire logo are the words

676
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
Home of swamp

677
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
