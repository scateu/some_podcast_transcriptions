1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:06,912
The first time Bill Penningtons house in Houston flooded it was Memorial Day of 2015

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,216
28 in of rain fell

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,752
And he had no idea what the

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:16,128
Doing a hindsight very stupid things like putting towels of it by the front door.

5
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,408
Keep the water from coming in

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
And then I turn around and there's

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,992
Literally water bubbling up

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:21,760
From

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,320
The floor like in the middle of my house

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
Spell grabs his wife

11
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
His two kids

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
The two dogs

13
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,184
And they go to that

14
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,976
And stay there for 6

15
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,768
Hours they're watching the water

16
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,816
Higher and higher porches

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,984
An interesting experience you know kids have to go to the bathroom cuz when I eat food so it's like okay yeah

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,544
The second time build house flooded

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,080
It was tax day of 26

20
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:51,712
Yaboo got 16 in but this time he knew to get out of the house so he and his family went over to the neighbor

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,552
The third time built house flooded it was Hurricane Harvey

22
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
He just late last

23
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,856
And by now he's an ex

24
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,416
Yeah he hears a meteorologist say the words

25
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,440
Biblical

26
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
Slide

27
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
And there's no Panic

28
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,048
He packs up his family and heads over to his parents

29
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,912
The next Monday Bill puts on his work boots any Pilots his truck a mile home

30
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,728
He pulls into the driveway and he sees

31
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
The weirdest

32
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,056
Cons of watermelon

33
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
All over

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
The place

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
Watermelon

36
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Watermelon

37
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
And so I'm like what

38
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,736
In the world who is growing watermelon

39
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,600
Actually it's turns out there's a small grocery store

40
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,648
Four blocks away from me but it's

41
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
Upstream

42
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,792
And it had gotten flooded and it's some pointed door had broken open and all of these watermelons

43
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,376
Set flow down out of the grocery store into

44
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,192
The street in the yard and

45
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,984
Bill pushes open

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
In his front door and looks inside

47
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
And for the third time in three years

48
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,432
His house has been destroyed by a flood

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,832
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm next up

50
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,928
So we're going to ask why does Bill Pennington keep coming back to this house

51
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
And why does the government keep

52
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,768
Paying him to do it

53
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,424
Support also comes from Fidelity Investment

61
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,416
6 years ago when Bill Pennington bought his house

62
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,488
His mortgage lender made him by

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
Flood insurance that

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,352
That right there is the simple answer to why he is still here

65
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
He's in church

66
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Bills going to get a payout

67
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
His house and his

68
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
Get insurance is a beautiful thing it protects you against

69
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
Rescue make sure

70
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
You don't lose everything

71
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,152
Adventures in general are not afraid of her

72
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
They will insure just about anything

73
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,784
Poker games Rockets body parts

74
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,624
They will do that as long as they can charge enough to make it worthwhile

75
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,696
All interest care about is at the end of the year they

76
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
Taking in more money than they pay

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
Bill Pennington flood insurance policy

78
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,608
Is not under written by a company

79
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
Is underwritten by the Federal Gov

80
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,704
And when you get to pay out later this year

81
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,312
The money is going to come from the federal government and to understand why that is all you have to do is

82
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,384
Standing Bill Penningtons driveway and look up and down the

83
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Hi

84
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
Hi. How's it going how are you doing

85
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
So

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Cheese

87
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
This

88
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
Is

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
Looks like the inside of your house is outside your house

90
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
Yep pretty much that is

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,072
I would say somewhere on 95% of my home and possessions

92
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,608
Out on the curb in the trash

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
What are we what are we looking at what do you see

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,216
What's sheetrock about the doors

95
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,056
And then I turn around and I look down the street and it's the same thing

96
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,872
Sheetrock and doors and big bags of

97
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
Toys and clothes in

98
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Garbage

99
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,504
On the lawn of just about every single house on this

100
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,320
Almost everyone stuff is out on everyone

101
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,416
And this right here what you're looking at is something insurance companies

102
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
Do not like

103
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
They call it

104
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,536
Correlated risk or geographically correlated

105
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
And what it means is

106
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Right at this moment

107
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,447
Just about everybody on bills block is going to have a massive

108
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Flood insurance

109
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,287
And that is a really scary idea to insurance

110
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
What insurance companies love

111
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Is when risk is not Coral

112
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
Write think about car insurance

113
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
Is Bill got in a car accident

114
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
His neighbors are not

115
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
Also all going to get in car

116
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
The same day

117
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,975
And so insurance companies can deal with that they're not afraid of risk they just don't want it all to happen at the same time

118
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
Or in the same place

119
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,095
So up until the 1960s most insurance companies

120
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Warrant offering flood insurance

121
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
And then in nineteen

122
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
65 there was this

123
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
Huge storm Hurricane Betsy hit the Gulf Coast

124
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
It was a harvey style hurricane it was a

125
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
The cataclysm

126
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
Wiped out thousands of homes

127
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
And most

128
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
People did not have flood insurance

129
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
The government decided we need to do some

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
And they did

131
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
They created this thing that

132
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,903
It still exists today is called the national flood insurance

133
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
Nfip

134
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
It does a couple of thing

135
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
1

136
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,815
Try to convince people not to build in Risky areas

137
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
But if they do

138
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,679
It tries to encourage them to build smart to raise their houses

139
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
But as we saw in Houston

140
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Deterrence does not always

141
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
Cities get bigger

142
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,407
Weather patterns change an area that wasn't high-risk

143
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
Becomes pirate

144
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,551
So if you're in a risky area and you get hit by a flood

145
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,599
The government has your back

146
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
Just as long as you've got insurance

147
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
The government will pay your claim

148
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,743
Okay so the government is going to act like an insurance

149
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
It collects premiums from people like Bill and other Houston nights and it tries to collect more every year that I paid

150
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Wrightwood

151
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Here is where the problems

152
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,799
Start a couple years after the nfip the federal government

153
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
It starts offering flood insurance

154
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
They realize

155
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Not enough

156
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
People are buying

157
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
The insurance

158
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,015
Sony early 70s the government doubles down

159
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
It's his

160
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
Look Joe homeowner in Houston

161
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
You live in high-risk area

162
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
You have a federally backed mortgage

163
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
You have to buy footage

164
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,303
But this is America in America we do not like

165
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
To be told what to do

166
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
You'll be loved in America

167
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Cheap stuff

168
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,727
So in the early seventies the government pushes the price of flood insurance

169
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Way down

170
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
In an effort to get more people

171
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,591
Put the sign up and here's what's been happening since

172
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
People are paying those cheap

173
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
Premium

174
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
The nfip is

175
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
Is chugging along

176
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
And then

177
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
There's a bad year

178
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
A year with a lot of fun

179
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,623
And those premiums haven't added up

180
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,183
To nearly enough money to cover everyone

181
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
If this was an insurance company

182
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
They would be bankrupt

183
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
But it's not it's a government program so

184
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
The nfip goes to the treasury

185
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
And says hey

186
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
We need to borrow some money

187
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,263
The pay people like Bill but then we have a couple more bad years with big flood

188
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,847
And the nfip is borrowing more and more from the treasury

189
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:16,735
And now here we are in 2017 and the nfip owes the treasury around

190
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,783
30 billion dollars

191
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
And people we spoke to for the story said

192
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
The nfip is probably never going to pay that debt back

193
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
And that means

194
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
Taxpayers eventually will be on the hook for this

195
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,655
Yes floods are hard to ensure that is a real thing that correlated wristband

196
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
But a big problem is

197
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,007
The government offering those discounted rate

198
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Yes

199
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Discounted rates

200
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
Great for homeowners

201
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,711
But that kind of sucker punches another key Concept in insurance which is

202
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Your rates

203
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
Are supposed to reflect your wrist

204
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
Yeah Bill Pennington totally get

205
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
When my son turns 18 and he's driving

206
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
I don't want to insure him

207
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463
Right so he's going to be buried

208
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,071
We have a long long track record of 18 year old boys doing stew

209
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Stupid stuff

210
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,679
Actually went to Houston looking for someone like Bill somebody whose house

211
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Is flooded again and again

212
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,311
Because while we were reading about flood insurance which is what we do here

213
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
We came across this amazing status

214
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
Over the course of the flood insurance programs life

215
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
A tiny percentage of house

216
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
1%

217
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Have you eaten up more than a

218
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Quarter of the

219
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
Is there houses that have flooded over and over and over

220
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:28,927
Mike Mills

221
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
So while I was standing with Bill in

222
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,511
The shell of his house

223
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
I asked him

224
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,119
How much has Insurance paid you out over the last 3 years

225
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,191
And he took out his phone and he is a Dropbox app

226
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
So this is

227
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
Gaiam Sol

228
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
I think I still have

229
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
Yeah the 2016 flood the 20

230
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
I-15 flood all the documentation

231
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
And look over shoulder

232
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
So this is a history of

233
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,551
Every claim on this property address

234
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
I'm just going to I'm just going to add it up

235
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,439
Okay alright let's do this together here we go

236
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,327
This document on his phone shows that builds house has gotten flood insurance payments

237
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
From the federal government

238
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
5

239
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
Different time I thought he was flooded three times

240
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
She was 43 times yes

241
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
But the house also flooded into

242
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,567
2001 and in 1980

243
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
So we had those up on my calculator

244
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
And then we get to Bills play

245
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
This is Memorial Day 2015

246
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,247
Teen Tax Day 2016

247
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,391
So at that point swear now at 870,000

248
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
$51 and forty

249
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:38,303
This house for which you paid $525,000

250
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
Has now cost

251
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
The national flood insurance program

252
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
878000

253
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
$51.44

254
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
$878,000

255
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Yes and Nick here's the thing

256
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
That is

257
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
Before hurricane Harvey right

258
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
Bill has just filed another claim

259
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,063
He will certainly get another payout he is insured

260
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
And this time it's for newer

261
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Better stuff

262
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,231
So he's insured up to $350,000

263
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,815
To be conservative we typed in Vegas 300000

264
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
What is that

265
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,911
That's 1.18 $8000000

266
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Change

267
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
Bill's house

268
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Will have cost

269
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
The federal government

270
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
More than

271
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
$1000000

272
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
What is he paying in preemie

273
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
He's paying

274
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
$4,800

275
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
A year

276
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Seems like nothing

277
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
Or at least not nearly enough

278
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,903
Do you feel bad that you are costing a lot of money

279
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
I mean maybe

280
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
Some sort of psychopath

281
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,047
After something but it doesn't necessarily feel personal to me because it's

282
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
I feel like I haven't

283
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
I didn't intentionally flood my house

284
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
I didn't decide

285
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
I'm going to buy this house and I'm going to make it

286
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
Killing on flood Revenue

287
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Saferite so

288
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,383
Bill is not a psychopath I mean I've considered it for a minute

289
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,223
No I mean your eye if we were in Bill's position

290
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
I'm pretty sure we would do the same thing right like

291
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:08,927
Think about it the government requires bills mortgage lender to require that he has flood insurance

292
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
So he can get flood insurance

293
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,815
Any pays premiums just like you would to a normal insurance

294
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Company

295
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Except

296
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
This is not a normal insurance,

297
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,519
What do you think you'd be paying if there was no government flood insurance

298
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,127
I don't think I could get insurance

299
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,527
Quite right I give this point I don't there's probably not an insurance company in the world that would insure my property

300
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,111
It's just like if I was a

301
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,415
A drunk driver that had gotten the

302
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
5 DUIs in

303
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:47,839
Then two and a half years that I wouldn't be able to get insurance I probably get a driver's license I would be able to drive so

304
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:54,239
Your house is the drunk driver of Holmes your house is like this 17 year old boy on a motorcycle

305
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Who drink

306
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Of home

307
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
Exactly

308
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
He knows this is

309
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
I was talking to Bill he offered a solution

310
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,759
One thing I found out while I was driving around you

311
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Houston is that

312
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Moose

313
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,111
People in that City do not have flood insurance

314
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,159
It's only about 15%

315
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Voodoo

316
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
And I'm asking them

317
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Why

318
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
Why are you not insured

319
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
And they're telling me

320
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,887
Because no one ever said I had to buy flood insurance

321
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,031
Great cuz remember the government rule says that if you're in a flood-prone area and you are federally backed mortgage

322
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
Your lender must make you buy

323
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,943
Flood insurance rates so I'm talking to people who are technically outside of the high-risk area

324
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,991
Or in the case of some older folks

325
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
In the mortgage is paid off

326
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,599
Nobody can tell you you have to buy flood insurance

327
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
And there's a 30

328
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,207
You were supposed to buy flood insurance

329
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,767
But you let it lapse and nobody knows

330
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,679
All of this all these people were kind of rolling around in the back of my mind and then

331
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Bill said

332
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
If you're in a flood-prone area which is

333
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
It's probably anywhere along the Gulf Coast

334
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
Everyone should

335
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
Should have flooding

336
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,711
Weather that has come through a federal mandate

337
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
I just want to point out that you are a text

338
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
You are texting who owns guns

339
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,903
You are a you say you you lean libertarian

340
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
And you are saying

341
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
Everybody should have

342
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Dubai

343
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
For insurance

344
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
Absolutely bills argument is

345
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
We make more people buy flood insurance

346
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
So weird

347
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
Running the risk around more

348
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:34,591
If I'm not in a risky area my rates are going to be super low I'm paying $10 a month for my third-story apartment

349
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,895
But because there are more of us paying

350
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:42,527
There's just a bigger pool is it sounds like it makes so much sense but do you know what that would be

351
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,647
Oh man that would be a government mandate that you have to buy insurance

352
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
And we tried that

353
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,535
With health insurance and we are still going through that with health insurance

354
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,631
So we had to call up the people who are actually ensuring

355
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,447
The Federal Emergency Management agency

356
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
Yes FEMA

357
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
FEMA administers the flood insurance

358
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Program

359
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,615
We called up Andy Neil who's an actuary

360
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,455
It's like the most boring job in the world

361
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,783
You know imma I'm a flood fighter I'm helping to make our country safer

362
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
Andy Mineo is basically the guy ensuring

363
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903
Bill doesn't always work for the government

364
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
She's been in the private sector

365
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,071
So we ask this question about the national flood insurance program nfip that we had been thinking about for this

366
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
Entire time

367
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
If you are

368
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,167
Private company would you ensure bill

369
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,519
Well you know it's an interesting thing so

370
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
The nfip does not get

371
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Diseno

372
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
So

373
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
In my rate-setting process we do have

374
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
High rates for risk Europe

375
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
People model race

376
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
Straight for moderately risky

377
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Rates for

378
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Glow recipe

379
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
For the very riskiest of structures

380
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
For the very riskiest

381
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,975
Across all lines of insurance

382
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
There's a difficulty

383
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
In offering insurance

384
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
Very highest

385
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
But you got to do it

386
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,167
I have to do it I have to take off

387
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,983
Kind of dogs are question about private in

388
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Well

389
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,919
Yes but he's an employee of the federal government and as an employee of the federal government he has

390
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
Ice to ensure bills house

391
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
This would all work out better

392
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
If any nail could charge bill

393
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
More for his insurance

394
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,439
Me am so that bills rates would actually reflect his risk

395
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,791
And maybe he would want to move to another neighborhood or put his house up on stilts

396
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:36,191
Yeah but Andy Neal and FEMA don't really have control over how and when and where they

397
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Raise rate

398
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
Those decisions are made by Congress

399
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Well

400
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
In terms of that I would like to

401
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
To say that

402
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
Congress has a very difficult

403
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
It's it's

404
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
It's a very difficult policy area

405
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
Set aside

406
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,623
How to

407
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Set the space

408
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
It's hard

409
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
You tell people

410
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,303
You have to buy insurance and then on top of that your rates are going to be really high

411
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
And this upsets people

412
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
And upset

413
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
People upset politician

414
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,263
There is this other program that FEMA has where they give grants to elevate houses

415
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,079
Like bells or tear them down and help people move to another neighbor

416
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,687
But those grants are really hard to get bill has already applied and he got

417
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
You get the impression here that FEMA and

418
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,367
People like Andy Neill are really trying to make the situation better

419
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,231
In fact back in April Bill Pennington in Houston got a letter in the mail

420
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
The letter said

421
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Bill

422
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,095
You are now enrolled in National

423
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Flood insurance program

424
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Direct

425
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
At that point they don't

426
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,127
Tell you anything other than that so you know you're moving to nfip direct you didn't know what nfip direct men

427
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:54,527
You know I probably wasn't a good thing but it is not a good

428
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
It means hey buddy

429
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
Your house keeps flooding

430
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Again

431
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
And again

432
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
We're going to keep raising your rates

433
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
Until they're closer to what you should be paying

434
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
And Bill he

435
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
He just doesn't want to do this

436
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Flood

437
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Rebuild

438
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Slide

439
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
Repelled watch

440
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
Chip insurance rates

441
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
Pic higher and higher

442
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,335
There's an obvious question here which is why doesn't bill just move to a different neighbor

443
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,735
I asked him and he said look I like this neighborhood the schools are great I went to the school's my dad went to be

444
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Lee Schools

445
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
I want to stay in my neighbor

446
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,855
So bill is going to figure out a way to stay

447
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
He's going to take that insurance payout

448
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
Going to try to get a loan

449
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
He's going to try to put his house up on stilts

450
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Or maybe

451
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,095
Peritol down and rebuild

452
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Just a little bit higher

453
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
But he is going to make sure that

454
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
But he never floods

455
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,519
Those are all things that bill

456
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Plans

457
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
To do

458
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,591
But they will take time

459
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
You know what he's currently doing

460
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
He's currently paying his

461
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
Way too low insurance premium

462
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
And say he doesn't get his house elevated in

463
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
Say there's another flood

464
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
The federal government

465
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671

Been a minute with Sam Sanders Noel was on a few weeks back

489
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,703
My favorite part about the show is once a week

490
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:27,103
They asked listeners what's the best thing that happened to you this week and they play this Montage from all around the country

Bill Pennington is not the only person

495

Right there a lot of these houses that flood

496
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
Again and again

497
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:56,031
Wellington Houston the most extreme case that I heard of is this

00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,919
It's flooded 16 times

500
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
In 18 years
