1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,840
About a month ago there was a pretty big upset in National Palace

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:08,192
It is easily the most shocking result of this political season

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,496
Stunning defeat this is a seismic

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,568
Political upset and I just was apparently a thesaurus Worthy

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,848
Upset but

6
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,664
We're talking about the race for the Democratic nominee

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
Can in New York

8
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,480
14th congressional district

9
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,760
Which includes parts of

10
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,784
The queens and the Bronx

11
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:27,392
In this primary one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress

12
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,928
The guy named Joe Crowley

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
He lost

14
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
Service First

15
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,792
Time in Canada at this woman who is virtually unknown

16
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Alexandria ocasio-cortez a 28 year old male bartender Community organizer Bernie Sanders supporter working class

17
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,520
New Yorker if she calls herself and Democratic Socialist

18
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,568
Specifically ocasio-cortez

19
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,128
Did a member of an organization called

20
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,176
The Democratic socialists of a

21
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
A few years ago basically no one had ever heard of it.

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
Today their membership is a

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,928
Floating new chapters are popping up across the country and

24
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:06,560
So are Democratic Socialist candidate

25
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,352
And so this got us wondering

26
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
Who exactly are

27
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,936
America's new socialist

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

29
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
I'm Danielle Curtis

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
And I'm Kenny Malone

31
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
Today on the show

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,384
The Democratic socialists of America

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,176
Who are they what do they want

34
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
Where they come from

35
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
And how do you take an idea that was political poison for decades and relaunch it in today's chaotic full

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Oracle Arena

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
Spoiler alert

38
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
You do not include an arm

39
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,488
Looking for violent revolution if that's

40
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
What's the question

41
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,560
I guess it's kind of what I was

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Support for this podcast

43
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,912
In the following message come from Madewell

44
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,984
Where the motto is good days start with great jeans

45
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
How did they make them so great Madewell starts with

46
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Premium dinner

47
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,408
Then offers men's and women's styles for seriously every

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,248
Also you can recycle any brand of jeans in a Madewell store

49
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
And they'll give you $20 off and you pay

50
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
They work with the blue jeans go green program

51
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,440
Turn old jeans into housing insulation for communities in need

52
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
Terms apply

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,328
Ready to find your perfect fit stop by a Madewell store or go to Madewell.

54
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,400
Okay so let's get this out of the way

55
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
This is an episode about social

56
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,312
But we are not here to do an episode arguing over the merits of

57
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
If you want to pick that fight call your uncle or a political

58
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
Science student there whatever

59
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
No but we were interested in was

60
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
Just like the basics for starters

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
Who even are

62
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
These Democratic socialists of America

63
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
We figured

64
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
We should probably go meet some of them

65
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,280
Which is how I found myself at a bar in West Virginia

66
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
So it's a Saturday in early July It's Just Before Sunset and I'm at a brewery near a town

67
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
Call Reidsville

68
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,568
It's not super hard to find the Democratic socialists inside this

69
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:58,688
There's this guy he's wearing a t-shirt that says united we bargain divided

70
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:01,504
Baby bag is also a young woman telling the story of how she

71
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Status

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
Anti anti-immigration protest

73
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
And how she got arrested

74
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,440
The house Susan Sarandon with her

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
This is a sort of socialist

76
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Happy hour

77
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Amita

78
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
Of the local chapter of the democratic social

79
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
America or the

80
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
PSI

81
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,472
The BSA is not a political party

82
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
It's a non-profit

83
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
It's got chapters all over the

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
And that young woman talking about getting arrested

85
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
She co-founded this chapter in West Virginia

86
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
Her name is Kelly rose she's 36 years old

87
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
Probably

88
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
I think I'm 36

89
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
Yeah I'm Thursday

90
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,160
Kelly is a registered independent

91
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,744
She would bet that she's more religious than your average

92
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,352
I am a Christian I might be the only one in our little chapter that

93
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Is a person

94
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:54,496
Possibly my mother would want to be me on this but I think if anybody was ever a socialist it was Jesus

95
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
3 years ago the DSA

96
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
Head only about 6000 members

97
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Across the country

98
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
That is fewer members

99
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
In the American Racing

100
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
That is my best sound

101
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Just nice

102
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,208
Socialism is a word that comes with a lot of baggage for a lot of American

103
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
It has associations with

104
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
Cold War and communism end

105
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,863
Severe looking totalitarian leaders

106
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
But it has been undergoing a sort of Rehabilitation

107
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,239
It arguably started with Bernie Sanders

108
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
Was on stage running for

109
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
Saying that he was a social

110
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
End Alexandria Ocasio Cortez nomination

111
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Last month

112
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
Got even more people talking about socialist

113
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
In the last 3 years membership in the Democratic socialists

114
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
America has really grown in

115
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Shut up by more than six

116
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
600%

117
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
Which is still only around 45000

118
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,279
Bernie Sanders however not one of those men

119
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
He does consider himself a democratic social

120
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Ideologically

121
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
Is not a dues-paying member of the

122
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
DSA Oregon

123
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
Ization

124
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
And that is just fine by some of the DSA member

125
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,919
Bernie Bernie is definitely there's some policies that I think he's been a little too soft.

126
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,271
A little too Democrat for me as a founding member of this chapter

127
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,623
The DSA Prides itself on being a big socialist

128
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,439
Their members who want a system that looks

129
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
More like what

130
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Scandinavian countries have that would be

131
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,351
Higher taxes to fund much more comprehensive government services like

132
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Social safety net

133
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
That

134
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,519
And then at the other end of the spectrum you have members who think capitalism has completely failed

135
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
I think the whole system needs to be replaced

136
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,127
And Djoser Nelly it's more towards data

137
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
Improve capitalism ultimately want to get rid of it

138
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,087
Nail down what exactly the DSA want

139
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
Because you've got all of these

140
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,183
Is Chapters everywhere they all have different priorities

141
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,023
And those chapters themselves have members with different socialist ideas

142
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
But there is a national headquarters

143
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
Of the DSA

144
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
It's 400 miles away

145
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Virginia butt

146
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
Luckily for us

147
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
It's only 3 train stops away from our office

148
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Maria

149
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Great to meet you

150
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
Maria svart is the national director of the day

151
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
Dsh has been a member since

152
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
Is college in the two

153
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
Go to do like a tour of the offices

154
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,367
Sherbet in the nerve center of the American Socialist movement

155
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:25,023
Democratic socialists of America National office

156
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,863
This probably is the epicenter of socialist activity right now

157
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,423
But there's not really too much going on in this

158
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Does offices

159
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
Teeny it's got this

160
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
Dingy old carpet

161
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
Is there a pamphlet stacked against the wall

162
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Fun fact

163
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
The Democratic socialists headquarters

164
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
Right next to Wall Street

165
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Is that a coincidence

166
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,039
Well you know we like to be close to have an eye on them but mostly it's cuz they're meant to

167
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,855
The DSA is a nonprofit organization

168
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
People pay dues they join

169
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Local chapters because

170
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
They believe in this

171
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Unifying ideology

172
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
When it comes right down to it

173
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
People need to be able to leave live a dignified life

174
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
I mean there are certain things that should not be left up to the mark

175
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
In other words

176
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Socialism

177
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,495
Which in any form has been a tough

178
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
Cell in the United

179
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
For a long time

180
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
The DSA was founded in 19

181
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Ronald Reagan

182
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Was the president

183
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
Deregulating

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
He was turning the economy.

185
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Towards the free market

186
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,343
Selling socialism at this point in the US it was an uphill battle

187
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,487
The organization to be honest did go through. Where we were less active the membership shrank

188
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
Elected officials

189
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
Didn't want to be associated with us

190
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,887
Through the 1980s and 1990s to 2000s

191
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,495
Socialism was a dangerous political bomb to live at one of your opponent

192
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Throw it

193
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
And your competition would have

194
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
Chaos on their hands

195
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,687
We actually had at one point we tried to give a donation that it was richer

196
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
So right

197
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
Maria can't remember the exact details but

198
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
She thinks it was a state-level race in mm

199
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,719
And the candidate was afraid of what might happen if they took this socialist money

200
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
Their opponent might send out a mailer

201
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
To everyone in their District

202
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,655
But a picture of them next to authoritarian dictators

203
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,215
From history and say they were all socialists

204
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
And then have a picture

205
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
The candidate

206
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,567
But of course in the last three years that has

207
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,591
Totally change

208
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
And they're all of these little ways you

209
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
You can tell the TSA was not quite prepared for all of the

210
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
For example

211
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Some of their old press releases

212
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,855
Does have Maria's personal contact information

213
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:30,207
I was fine when nobody was calling them a writing much about the DSA

214
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
Maria says she's

215
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
Still dealing with all of the trouble that that

216
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Caused

217
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
Saiguette

218
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails a day

219
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:43,775
It literally takes time just to forward them to the rest of the stuff for the DSA is now on a lot of

220
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
People's radar

221
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
And they would like to know what exactly

222
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
Is the dsa's platform

223
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
Andrea tells us

224
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Well we don't

225
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
Really have a platform

226
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,087
But a year ago the chapters did get together and they hammered out

227
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,159
Three big National priorities that they were all going to

228
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Push for

229
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
Number one

230
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Winning medicare-for-all

231
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
Number two

232
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,351
Supporting workers and building stronger unions and

233
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
Number three

234
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
And electing Democratic Socialist office

235
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,519
At all levels of government are each of these ideas really

236
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,567
Quickly just to get a sense of what the

237
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
DSA is thinking

238
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
First

239
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Medicare for all

240
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
This term is getting thrown around a lot on the left

241
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
These days end

242
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:30,111
Basically the idea is to take Medicare which is taxpayer-funded insurance for seniors

243
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
And give it to everyone else too

244
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,559
So taxpayer-funded health insurance for everyone we don't want something that's a half-measure we want to get

245
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,143
Private Industry totally out of the system we just want to

246
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Make sure everybody's in

247
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,519
Every gets Healthcare now this is something Bernie Sanders talked about a lot

248
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
In his presidential campaign

249
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,127
Answer for how much it could cost which is

250
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
A lot

251
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
Trillions and trillions of dollars

252
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,759
Okay the second thing the DSA is working on right now

253
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
Is electing more

254
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Democratic Socialist

255
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
The news outlets like us

256
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
We tend to focus on the Socialist

257
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
Part of the dsa's name

258
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
What's the word Democratic it's in there too

259
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,631
And what this means by in large is working within the existing political system

260
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
You know democratic

261
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,519
But it's been 20 years since a member of the DSA with

262
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
Fennel seed

263
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
Alexandria ocasio-cortez

264
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
Because of how New York politics works

265
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
He's about as close to a shirt

266
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Is possible

267
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
And while she is the most prominent

268
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,831
There's a whole slate of other DSA politicians in smaller race

269
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
A couple things you might hear

270
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
Julia Salazar

271
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
She's running for a state seat in New York

272
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,511
And then there's Sara innamorato in Pennsylvania

273
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,863
So far only 5 DSA endorsed candidates have won primaries

274
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,679
Five primary Victory just isn't allowed in the

275
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,239
In the third and final priority

276
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
For the DSA

277
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Unions

278
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Helping to empower work

279
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
So

280
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
What that looks like is we

281
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Show up

282
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,015
On picket lines and workers are trying to form a union or negotiate a contract

283
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Alastair

284
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:08,159
Unions are kind of sitting with their head in the sand and they're not really being effective at organizing there

285
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Your co-worker is

286
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
Are we support members

287
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
Organizing your coworkers

288
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
So those are the three priorities at the SAS

289
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,191
If you look at the organization's literature you realize that

290
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
Those things are not

291
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
The goal

292
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,335
I think they are just incremental steps towards a much more radical

293
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Take healthcare for example

294
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:34,527
The group is pushing medicare-for-all which is a big thing it's essentially socialized insurance

295
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,087
But the TSA would like to go even bigger

296
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
It would like to socialize all of metal

297
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,695
Like in the National Health System in England

298
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,023
We're being a doctor is a taxpayer-funded government job

299
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,351
And take the dsa's focus on strengthening unions here

300
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
Is how Maria explained

301
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Is the bigger vision

302
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
A great analogy is

303
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,103
You know in a union you might negotiate that you want you know what say there's a loaf of bread you're going to keep a quarter of the bread

304
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Union

305
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,711
Negotiators might go to the bargaining table for contract and say we want 50%

306
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Of the bread

307
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Socialist would say we wanted

308
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
We want to own the bakery and run it in our own and

309
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
I love this analogy

310
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
Is bread and not iPhones

311
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
Because it sounds like we are living in lame

312
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
Do You Hear the People Sing Kenny I do

313
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
All the time

314
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Did you say

315
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
Is talking about a big idea

316
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
170

317
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,959
Years ago from Karl Marx the workers

318
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,495
Controlling the means of

319
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:32,895
Now the TSA is a non-violent organization they're not advocating overthrowing the factory or the bakery

320
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,455
They're just starting small by Marxist standards

321
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
East find supporting unions

322
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,831
And to be fair the bakery owners are probably safe for now because

323
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
There aren't really that many members of the

324
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
The DSA

325
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
45000 members would not even

326
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
Instill most football

327
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,839
But the TSA it knows that sometimes crazy ideas can take hold

328
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
Case in point

329
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
While we were visiting

330
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
GSA National

331
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Law offices

332
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
Maria walked over to the Bookshelf

333
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Put down this

334
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Buck

335
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,895
6 in by 4 in around last

336
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
Actually have four copies of

337
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
Of this book it is called

338
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,807
The other America had it flies but it did totally changed

339
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
Magnus re-written

340
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,183
In the 1960s by a guy named Michael Harrington

341
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Also co-founded the DSA

342
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
He argued that there was this invisible impoverished

343
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,863
Class of people that no one was paying enough attention to

344
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:30,751
The other America was a big deal and it had people talking about poverty in a new way including

345
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
President John F

346
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,591
The book reportedly helped Inspire Kennedy

347
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
Ready to launch an assault on poverty

348
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,687
That would lead to a slate of program

349
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Including Medicare

350
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Which launched in 90

351
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
At the time

352
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,599
Medicare seem to a lot of conservatives like this

353
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Crazy extension of the government

354
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
Pure socialism

355
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
And they weren't entirely wrong

356
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,535
Medicare is a form of socialized insurance

357
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,351
And today a lot of Americans take that for granted

358
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,911
They just see it as another government service

359
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
And so here we have this tiny book

360
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
Written in the 90

361
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
1960s

362
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,055
Buy a Democratic Socialist

363
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
The help Spark

364
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
A real socialist program that 50 years later

365
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,967
Is really popular with a lot of them

366
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,303
This message comes from NPR sponsor

367
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
Capital One Capital One
