1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,072
This is part two of our series on recycling part 1

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,888
Is the origin story of why we started recycling

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:06,656
He should go listen

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,424
In Boston

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,728
Alright let's just get this out of the way at the top here

6
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,752
The 3 R's

7
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:11,776
Reduce

8
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,568
Reuse and then

9
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,384
Recycle recycling is the last option

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
Although

11
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,456
It sometimes feels like it is the main option

12
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
And it is broke

13
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
In the United

14
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,576
And to see just how bad it has gotten

15
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,392
You just need to go to any waste and recycling

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,256
Except those waste and recycling centers don't really like to talk about how

17
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
Broken recycling is

18
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328
But

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
We found one place that would

20
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Nogales

21
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
Arizona

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
It's Thursday

23
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,264
Recycling day

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,616
And a City truck has gone to everyone's house picked up their recycling

25
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,200
And brought them to a place called Tucson Recycling and waste

26
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,904
Beer bottles

27
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
So water bottles milk jugs

28
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
Cardboard boxes

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
Always

30
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
Stuff tumbling out of the truck is

31
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,936
Carefully hand sorted and handprints

32
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
Soup cans and newspapers and

33
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
Peanut butter jars

34
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,288
Open the upstanding citizen

35
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,616
Sins of Nogales Arizona who have made the effort

36
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,920
To help save our planet and our ocean

37
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,248
And the guy overseeing all of this Delbert Gallego

38
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
Does that sorting and rinsing using fact

39
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,624
Critical recycling is a delicate process you need to do all that

40
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
You have to Triple rinse

41
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,952
The plastic

42
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,512
Eminem if you had the lids on it

43
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,816
That's considered contamination

44
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
No lids

45
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
Wow

46
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
Oh I've been doing that one wrong

47
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,240
So the city of Nogales when

48
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
Around to everyone's house this morning and picked up

49
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
They're recyclable

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
They brought them here

51
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
And where is all this going to go

52
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,248
It's dumped over here for right now

53
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
And went over here for

54
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,320
Trash

55
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,624
The recycling

56
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
Is going into the trash

57
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:11,072
I am watching Christine beer bottles and Juice cartons and cardboard boxes get smoke

58
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
Pushed into a pile of wet

59
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,680
Gooey dripping food waste

60
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
And Soggy diapers

61
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
Our wish would be there

62
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:22,336
To be able to recycle it but we know we can't we'll end up landfill in that way

63
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,408
This is Kurt wall he's delbert's boss and he says

64
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
Something has gone

65
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
Terribly wrong

66
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
In the world ever

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
And it's not just no goddess

68
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
Cities all over the United States

69
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
Are shoving their recyclables

70
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
Into the trash pile

71
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
Unfortunately

72
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,744
Recycling is is not

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
I'm not saying it's dead

74
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
But

75
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
Is it certainly

76
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
I wouldn't say life support but it's critical

77
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,032
And I don't want to be the person to burst their bubble

78
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,592
You will not be the one to Break people's bubble

79
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,896
I will burst their bubble

80
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
Me and a bunch of cold

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Parted economist

82
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
I'm there and I'm Freddy Malone today the show recycling

83
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
He's on life support cities might be picking up your recyclables but there's a very good chance they are not

84
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
Being recycled and that

85
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Might

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
Be a good thing

87
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
If you really care about the planet

88
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,432

The NPR politics

Subscribe

102
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
To understand what went wrong in the world of recycling

103
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
We called economist

104
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
Bevan Ashton Miller at Occidental College

105
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:21,119
They're generally I teach in environmental economics I'm an environmental economist and environmental economics isn't pretty depressing

106
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
In class so I sometimes a teacher class called

107
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,007
Marriage money and motherhood I don't even want to know the findings of that

108
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,823
I have a really good friend who teaches in he's always like

109
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
I just love wage gaps they just make me so excited that I've liked on this end

110
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,831
Okay Bevan also knows a lot about the economics of recycling and

111
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,647
She says the first thing you need to know is that in economics

112
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
We have Goods

113
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
And we have bad

114
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,583
A good is something that you pay money to get that's why we called a good we're very simple people

115
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
Annabelle

116
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,215
Is something that you pay money for somebody to take it away

117
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,519
Every time you make a good like

118
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
A jar of peanut butter

119
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
You also make a bad

120
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
An empty jar of peanut

121
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
Something someone will need to dispose of

122
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:11,807
But back in the 1990's a few things happen that made all of our bags

123
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Really attractive

124
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
To China

125
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
China was making all this

126
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,743
Stuff and shipping it to the US in these huge cargo ships

127
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
They

128
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
We're bringing a lot of tankers

129
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,375
Into the US that we're dropping off materials

130
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,703
And it doesn't make sense to bring a tanker back empty

131
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,263
Tell some smart person was like Walden

132
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,847
Why don't we just fill those cargo ships up with something useful then

133
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
Like

134
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
Empty water bottles

135
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
China was like we can turn those things into like

136
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Polyester

137
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,135
Socks and sweaters what you're basically just woven out of really really really thin plastic bottles

138
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
And that's a market

139
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
4 Hour bad

140
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
Was born

141
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
Eventually

142
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,839
About half of the entire world

143
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Junk plastic

144
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
Was being sent

145
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,959
The China much of that coming from the US

146
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
And when this woodworking

147
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
It is what

148
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
Reimagine recycling to be

149
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,431
My peanut butter jar turning into freaking socks I mean that is a modern miracle

150
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
But then

151
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Just last year

152
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
Something change dramatic

153
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
China said

154
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
This isn't worth it for us anymore

155
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,719
Turning your peanut butter jar into stocks is creating too much pollution and

156
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
Frankly it's just too much work for us now

157
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Because

158
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:32,447
You guys aren't as good at triple rinsing your plastic as you think you are and you're not even sorting it properly their army

159
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,775
Milk jugs in with the peanut butter jars lid still on

160
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,311
Peanut butter still in the jar

161
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
A total mess

162
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
And it used to be worth it

163
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
For China

164
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,991
To just go ahead and clean this stuff up and sort it out on their end

165
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
Because you know labor was

166
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
Cheap and so

167
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,391
Cleaning and then recycling our old plastic and aluminum

168
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,719
What's cheaper than creating new plastic and aluminum

169
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Baidu

170
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,815
Drilling for oil and mining for bauxite in the ground which

171
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
How we get plaster

172
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Can aluminum but then

173
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
China's economy evolved

174
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
Labor got more expensive

175
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
And China said

176
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,799
We don't want to be the world's garbage

177
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Dump

178
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
An actual quote

179
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
And so China instituted

180
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
A new

181
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Plan

182
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Call Dean National

183
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
Sword their name for

184
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Annie's plan

185
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
China said

186
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
We're only going to take recyclables

187
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
If they are absolutely spotless

188
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
And perfectly

189
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Separated

190
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Plus

191
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
We are going to stop taking

192
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
24 different kinds of

193
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Including

194
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
Some kind of plastic mix paper

195
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
And certain metals

196
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,799
Vistana shocks throughout the entire recycling world

197
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
Seemingly overnight

198
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
The biggest recycling Market

199
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Shriveled up

200
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
And you can see the impact

201
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
That this had

202
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
In Nogales Arizona

203
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
He would see a lot of your

204
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
Really wet

205
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Nasty trash in there

206
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,671
Remember Kurt that guy who didn't want to burst AR recycle

207
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
Here is the position he's in now

208
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Keep Collective

209
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
All these recyclable

210
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
But he still needs to do something

211
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,679
China used to buy recyclables

212
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,239
Kurt actually got paid for this stuff

213
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
But when China went away

214
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
There was no one to pay for it anymore

215
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,151
Now it is on Kurt to pay

216
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
If he wants this stuff to get rid of

217
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,271
Whenever you go from being paid for a product

218
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
What happened to pay theirs

219
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
Absolutely is staying in the

220
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
An Awakening

221
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
At that time so now

222
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
Kurt could either

223
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Hey

224
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
$200

225
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
To get one ton of plastic recycled

226
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
Or he can pay

227
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
$30

228
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,679
Get that seem kind of plastic

229
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Buried in LA

230
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
Obviously I'm not going to bring it there for $200 a ton

231
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
It just simply

232
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,127
Didn't make Financial sense to recycle anymore

233
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
And so he has started

234
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
Landfilling

235
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,759
And cities all over the US are in the same position

236
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Summer just canceling

237
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,599
Parts of their recycling programs all together

238
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
Douglas County Oregon Franklin New Hampshire Deltona

239
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Florida

240
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
Broadway Virginia

241
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
There are entire cities that are saying

242
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,839
We're not even going to bother to pick up your blue banana

243
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,399
There are no more blue bins

244
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
An entire town

245
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,799
Nogales Arizona they're a little more optimistic they're at least making sure people are going through the motion

246
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:23,455
We don't want to just discontinue we don't want to just do away with it because I think a it'll be harder

247
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,503
Retrain people to

248
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
To do what we think is right thing

249
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
And

250
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
We have the hopes

251
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
That

252
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
At some point it'll it'll

253
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
Start up again

254
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
It took Americans so long to pick up the habit of separating our paper and our plastic that if we stay

255
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Stop doing it

256
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
Kurt worries

257
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
Residence won't pick to have it back up

258
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
Once there is a market for pasta

259
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Again

260
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
And sometimes when Kurt is

261
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
All alone at night and he sees April

262
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Killer Elite

263
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
Clean batch of cardboard boxes

264
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
His heart goes out to them

265
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,575
It doesn't make Financial sense but

266
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:05,439
These would make such great new boxes he opened up his wallet

267
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
And paste

268
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
For that stack of boxes

269
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
To get recycled

270
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Because again I couldn't

271
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
Bear to see it just going into the land

272
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
I could just throw it in the trash wood

273
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
Would not feel good at all

274
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
But then eventually Kurt says

275
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
He couldn't even pay anyone

276
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
Is cardboard they wouldn't even take it

277
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,479
You wouldn't even take it because again they've got so much product

278
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
They had nowhere to go with it

279
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,623
There have been piles of paper and cardboard stacking up all over the country

280
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,487
Like actual warehouses full of water bottles and piles of paper

281
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,815
Just waiting for some buyer to come back on the scene

282
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
So we've got all these recycle

283
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Piling up

284
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
What we're going to do about it

285
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
After the bridge

286

Hell it's called Garcia co-host

292
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Of the indicator podcast

293
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
This week on the show in the wake of the

294
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Two huge earthquake in California

295
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
We look at how Los Angeles is

296
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,447
Preparing for the high magnitude earthquake

297
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
It's science

298
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,007
To say is long overdue and will hit

299
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Directly

300
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
We also look at the jobs report

301
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
For June which

302
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
Confirm that yes

303
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
The labor market is slowing down creating

304
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Fewer jobs

305
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
Each month that it was last year

306
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
And finally we also look

307
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
And what's been happening

308
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
Deutsche Bank

309
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855

Check out the indicator

Planet Money

312
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,231
Okay so we've got piles

313
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Up recycling

314
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Piling up

315
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Or getting land

316
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Because

317
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,191
China doesn't want our dirty poorly washed and sloppily sorted recycling

318
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,007
So we wanted to talk to some experts about

319
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
What are options are

320
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
At this point

321
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
It seems

322
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
The main issue is that like if we

323
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Had perfectly clean

324
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,759
Recyclables then China would still buy

325
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
And so we could just

326
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:12,927
Clean it ourselves yeah but I'm not sure that would be I mean like there's a water question here

327
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,023
Right again Bevan Ashton Miller who teaches all the depressing classes

328
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,423
This is the argument that people are constantly having like do I spend all the water to clean my peanut butter container out

329
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,007
It takes so long to clean out a peanut butter container

330
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
An is an economically efficient for me to waste all that water cleaning out the stupid peanut butter

331
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
Everything so it can be recycled

332
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,759
Devin says in places like California where water is

333
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Precious

334
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,575
No you should not waste water on this

335
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
And hot water

336
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,927
Heated by burning fossil fuels

337
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Forget it

338
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,535
You will quickly undo the environmental benefits of reciting

339
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,143
It's okay maybe we should not clean extra carefully and then ship our recycling

340
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
The China butt

341
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
All these recyclable things

342
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
AR

343
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
Piling up all over the US so the US

344
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
Is now looking for another country

345
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
That maybe doesn't care as much

346
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
If our stuff is.

347
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
You know the way it used to be with China

348
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
So

349
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
You expected a time to be passed and it has been passed

350
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,647
This is Thomas Kinnaman and environmental economist at Bucknell univ

351
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Indonesia

352
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
India Malaysia these countries will

353
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
Except some of the stuff and they have them

354
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
Ml go through the same process

355
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,471
Accepting it until they say okay nevermind it's sweeping

356
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:33,311
At some point it looks like plastic and it's some other plant starts looking like garbage

357
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
Is that like

358
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,967
As the saying goes I actually just made that up

359
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,111
Thomas is kind of The Economist when it comes to looking at all the financial and environmental cost

360
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
And benefits

361
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Recycling

362
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
If you just landfill

363
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
Peanut butter jar obviously that has

364
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
Cost and Thomas cakes that into a cow

365
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
But he says

366
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
There are also costs

367
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,935
Do recycling like think about what it entails to recycle that peanut butter

368
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,495
A giant truck has to come to your home to

369
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Pick up

370
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Your peanut butter jar

371
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
And then drive it somewhere to get sorted and then drive it to a recycling center and then probably put it on a train which

372
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
Takes it to a boat which

373
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
Takes your jar Halfway Around the World

374
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
Their cost are there Financial cost

375
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,207
Paying the truck driver the boat driver this order and there are of course environmental cost

376
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
Like the pollution from

377
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
Trucks

378
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
And trucks

379
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
And trains and boats

380
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,119
And that's where you start wondering okay wait a minute

381
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Is

382
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
Recycling worth it

383
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
And when you crunch the numbers, says

384
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
Moore recycling

385
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Isn't always better

386
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
Sometimes

387
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
It is

388
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,943
Including in ways that you may not have thought of

389
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,343
You're sort of the untold story is that China's ban may may actually reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in

390
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Neosens

391
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,719
China was not very careful about what got into their ocean for long period of time

392
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,767
And if some of the plastic

393
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
Tiles were just too corrupted they could

394
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,911
Do whatever they wanted with that dump them in the ocean

395
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,311
Okay we know that there is a big pile of plastic floating in the ocean and Thomas is like

396
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
How do you think you got there

397
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
One bottle at a time

398
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
Really you could Maginot that big

399
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:19,295
Pyle plastic in the ocean came from the odd bottle being blown off the dock

400
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:24,671
San Francisco Bay and it went out there and joined all of its friends and they're all hanging out there also

401
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
Off the coast of Hawaii

402
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
That's probably very tiny part of it

403
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Countries

404
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Historically dumped

405
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,887
Waste out in the ocean

406
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,239
Thomas is saying that our Valiant recycling efforts have been

407
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007
Hurting

408
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
The ocean

409
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,567
In this cute sea turtles

410
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,175
You're given two options during the middle part of the country to the landfill about 50 miles away

411
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,735
Or put it on a boat to China and ask yourself

412
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
Which plastic bottles most likely end up in the ocean

413
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
I'll let you answer that stuff

414
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
And this gets us to the first

415
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,975
Of what it's going to be several controversial

416
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
Thomas Kinnaman

417
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,143
We're going to save you the Google and you can email us your complaints to Planet Money at NPR.

418
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:11,519
But here Thomas out okay he is an environmental economist he is interested

419
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
In helping the planet

420
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
So

421
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
I know it's hard to hear

422
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,943
But Thomas is saying that at the moment

423
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,759
It is better for the planet

424
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
If your

425
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
Plastic

426
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
Ends up in a landfill

427
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
Instead of on a boat

428
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Ship docked

429
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
To be recycled

430
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
And it's not just about

431
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,047
Falling in the ocean this is about the overall environmental cost

432
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Of that Journey

433
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
And actually is analysis finds that

434
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
This is also true

435
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
4 glass

436
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
It's better that ends up in

437
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
Paper though he finds it can go

438
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
Either way sometimes recycling is better sometimes

439
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
But good news everyone

440
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
You can still recycle something's

441
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Certain materials

442
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
Definitely, says it is

443
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
Terrible if it ends up in a landfill

444
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
Like metal

445
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
Tin and aluminum

446
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,391
Soup can and

447
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
Cocaine

448
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,743
Thomas says mining for new aluminum in the ground is worse

449
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,607
For the environment than the environmental footprint that goes into recycling aluminum

450
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
Even if we do ship them around the world

451
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,215
Anytime and aluminum can ends up in the landfill is that

452
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,775
Is the problem so we should be should be

453
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
Targeting 100% for those materials

454
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:25,247
We should basically do everything we can to make sure aluminum and other metals do not ever

455
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
End up in Orlando

456
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,599
All this time we've been demonizing water bottles

457
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
And Lacroix cans have been

458
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Open skating by

459
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,303
I'm going to watch you personally recycle that Sarah Gonzales

460
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
Here's the twist

461
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
Tin and aluminum

462
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
Are still being recycled by the us there is

463
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Still a market

464
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
For metal

465
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
Give me the crack another bottle

466
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
Sarah

467
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,431
I brought back up and keep it in crack it properly

468
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
Moral of the story Thomas says

469
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,015
Sarah is going to need to recycle all these

470
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Cans

471
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319
And she should barrier plastic

472
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,183
Yeah put it on the landfill or or or burn it which is what's happening this Wells and parts the world

473
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
Hold on

474
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
It is

475
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
Better environmentally

476
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
To burn plastic

477
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,911
That is not going to go down well

478
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:20,031
Are some of our listeners I feel like absolutely will not go down well in the United States

479
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,127
You have to travel to our other developed countries in the world

480
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
So you are making the case for

481
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
Burning flask

482
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
It's going to be expensive

483
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
Actually the most expensive

484
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
Way to dispose of waste

485
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
But Thomas says it is surprisingly

486
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
The best for the environment

487
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,815
Better than shipping to recycling places all over the world and better than landfill

488
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:49,215
And Germany and Anna Netherlands and in Sweden if they've embraced a new form of NC

489
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Generation

490
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,079
I refer to his consideration 2.0 consideration

491
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
2.0

492
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
Thomas's these newer

493
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
Fancier incinerators

494
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
Actually give off

495
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
You were dangerous emissions

496
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,575
That a backyard charcoal BBQ

497
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
He calls incineration

498
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,903
The Cadillac plan

499
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Because

500
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
He says

501
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,743
Basically solve all of the problems

502
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Incinerators

503
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,839
Generate electricity and hot water and the ashes

504
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
Are used for things like sidewalk tiles

505
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
It is

506
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Very

507
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
Expensive but he says

508
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
Incineration 2.0

509
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Is the future

510
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,639
That's a ridiculous that that's a ridiculous

511
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:35,039
Know that you're not being invited this is Eric Goldstein and attorney with the natural resources defense Council

512
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,111
And Eric is so not down with

513
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
Incineration 2.0

514
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
Well some people have said that

515
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,255
I guess. They don't say to me

516
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
Directly

517
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
They know that would be a mistake

518
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:51,167
Well we wanted to talk to Eric and the nrdc because

519
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
They represent another ideology

520
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
It's more absolute

521
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,823
Well we like recycling

522
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
They say

523
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
We owe it to the planet

524
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
To find a way

525
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,711
To make all kinds of recycling

526
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:07,295
Plastics are made from fossil fuels

527
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,647
If we continue to utilize every bit of

528
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,695
Coal and oil

529
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
Petroleum

530
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
That's buried under the ground

531
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,583
We're going to have a planet that is uninhabitable

532
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:25,471
Eric says the minute you burn or landfill a plastic jar instead of recycling it

533
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
You just took a resource from the Earth

534
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,567
The oil to make the jar

535
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,455
And you didn't even try to use it as much as possible you never gave that resource a second life

536
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
Not good and he says

537
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
Thomas's calculations

538
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,599
Are based on how things are today

539
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,903
Where we have to ship things around the world to recycle them

540
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
If

541
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,743
The US were to invest in more recycling plants

542
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
Domestically

543
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
The calculations would change

544
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
It could make

545
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
Sense to recycle

546
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
And

547
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:59,007
We also need to recognize that maybe it shouldn't all be left up to municipalities to solve this problem

548
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,591
And that manufacturers or the bear more of the burden

549
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:07,967
For figuring out how to deal with this ever-growing amount of waste that we're generating in the United States

550
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
Make less

551
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
And useless

552
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Reddit

553
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,599
That is the best thing we can do

554
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,391
And our environmental economist

555
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
Thomas Kinnaman

556
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
Totally agree

557
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,256
It's just that right now a lot of things

558
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
Commonplace

559
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
Your shampoo your

560
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,352
Peanut butter

561
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
So what are we supposed to do

562
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
