1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,280
Hey its toll road

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:05,888
On Tuesday California's governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that made national

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,216
California will eliminate cash bail

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,496
No more money bail

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,520
.

6
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,824
California is technically the first state

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,592
To do this

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,640
But another state came pretty close

9
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,480
New Jersey all but eliminated cash bail more than a year ago

10
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,040
The California law takes effect next

11
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,856
And it will look a lot like the system New Jersey launched

12
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
More than 18 months ago

13
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
So today in the show

14
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,744
We're giving New Jersey the credit it's so rarely receive

15
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,536
We're going to replay an episode from

16
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,864
2017 about how New Jersey's bail overhaul came

17
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,936
And at the end I'll be back with an update

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,960
On how it's going

19
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,752
Alright Keith take it away

20
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,104
We're going to start Today Show by telling you the story of an innocent

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,408
Amanda Mustafa Willis

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,712
The Story begins in the summer of 2010

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,016
We stopped it was 24 years old

24
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
He's a tall guy

25
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,320
Wears his hair in laundry

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
One day he was just walking down the street Newark New Jersey

27
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
Minding his own business

28
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
Eating a baguette

29
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,512
All the sudden he's he's a cop

30
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,072
Coming the wrong way down a one-way Street

31
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,888
The car stops right in front of them out, cop

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,472
Yeah they ran at me like I just like they just jumped out like that

33
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,800
Was swarming out like they knew what they were looking for and you know

34
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,920
I still did a whole bunch of other guys they just ran and I just stood there they Place me under arrest

35
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
The cops found a gun at the scene

36
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
And they said the gun was Mustafa

37
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
Who's taking downtown thrown in jail

38
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
Charged with unlawful possession

39
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,952
And this is where your constitutional protections are supposed to kick in

40
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,512
The gun charge is just an accusation

41
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
Mustafa hadn't been convicted

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
Have anything

43
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,864
This is how the system is supposed to work

44
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,424
Mustafa is supposed to go home to his job in

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Family

46
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
And start Gathering some evidence

47
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
Prove that the gun

48
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
It's not his

49
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,336
All he has to do is post bail

50
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,360
Annie's free to go

51
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
$50,000

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
Set by the judge and you can

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
Walk out of jail

54
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,760
He doesn't even have to come up with the whole amount right all he needs is

55
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Is 10%

56
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,600
So that he can pay the bail bondsman his feet 5,000 bucks

57
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
And then he has to find somebody to

58
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Guarantee the rest

59
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
And he's free to go

60
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,024
Dumb stuff I didn't have five thousand bucks for the 10% fee

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
And his family didn't want to be on the hook

62
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
450 thousand

63
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
So he's facing

64
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
Roodle choice

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
He can either

66
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
Tough it out in jail

67
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
Or

68
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,800
Plead guilty to a crime that he didn't come

69
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,128
But I told the public defender listen man I didn't do it

70
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,480
He said well you're probably sitting in here pending grand jury man I said well

71
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,808
Hey I guess I'm have to do it tonight it ain't my weapon so

72
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Mustafa

73
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
There is no way I'm going

74
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
To plead guilty to a crime I didn't

75
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
So he just sits in jail

76
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,000
Hand weights

77
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
While he was locked up

78
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,840
Mustafa lost his job driving a deliver

79
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,144
He missed his cousin's funeral

80
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
All because he couldn't afford to pay

81
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,752
Finally after a couple months

82
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
The judge lowered mustafa's failed

83
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,312
$30,000

84
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
And his family built

85
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
Once he was out

86
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,688
Mustafa could dig up evidence to fight the gun charge

87
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
It turns out

88
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,528
It was somebody on the Block who shot a video that

89
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
Mustafa says

90
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
Cruz the gun wasn't

91
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,160
The prosecutor that got hold today

92
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,232
Immediately she wanted to dismiss

93
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
This is what we stopped at

94
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
I've been saying all along

95
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
The charges were

96
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
But still

97
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
She had to spend

98
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,656
3 months in jail

99
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
For something he didn't do

100
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,496
And he end up owing this bail bondsman

101
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
3000 bucks no refunds left

102
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,872
I was in debt from this and I had to pay

103
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,480
All this money back to a bail bondsman company for something that I didn't even did

104
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,552
And the case was still dismissed and I still have to pay

105
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
But not for nothing

106
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Bell is supposed to help you

107
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,208
Who gets charged with a crime give them away to go home until their trial

108
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,536
But Mustafa Bale didn't help him get out of jail

109
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,888
Bill is what kept Him locked up

110
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,936
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

111
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
And I'm Keith Romer

112
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Bam has been around for centuries

113
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,592
It's pretty much the law of the land in every state in this

114
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,432
It's supposed to protect the rights of defendants like Mustafa

115
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
You haven't been convicted of anything

116
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,064
And at the same time Bill is supposed to give quartz an extra guarantee

117
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
The people are actually going to show up

118
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
But what if bail is broken

119
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
Today on the show

120
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,744
The New Jersey bail experience

121
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,071
Bunch of people who normally would not agree on anything

122
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Got together

123
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
Change the belt

124
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Their solution

125
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
They threw it out

137
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
The first thing you need to understand about

138
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,631
Is it is basically a workaround

139
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
For this fundamental problem in the

140
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
In a perfect world

141
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
If somebody got accused of a crime

142
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,335
The trial would happen instantly in a perfect world that come in the window

143
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,663
His world that's perfect but has crime in it hear me out

144
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
You'll get a trial the same day

145
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
If you're guilty you would go out to prison

146
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
If you're innocent you would go

147
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
But in the real world

148
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
There is a lot of time

149
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
Between that moment when somebody's arrested

150
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
And when the jury figures out what the right verse

151
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
You can't just lock up everybody in

152
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
Because

153
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,351
You know that annoying thing about innocent in

154
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
But if you just arrest somebody

155
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
Buddy and then immediately let him go

156
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,031
There's nothing necessarily to stop that guy from running off to Brazil

157
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Bell is a sort of compromise

158
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
That's right will let you go until your trial

159
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
If you give us some money

160
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,479
$10,000 or $100,000 whatever it is

161
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
Show up at your trial

162
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Get your money back

163
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
Not everybody thinks this is such a

164
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
A great sister

165
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
We talk to Roseanne Scotti

166
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,207
She is the sort of lawyer who looks at the criminal just

167
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
Menses

168
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Injured

169
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
She's the state director for the drug policy Alliance

170
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,935
And she thinks it is hold bail compromise we've been talking about

171
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,263
Is pretty obviously unfair for one big reason

172
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
Which is it not everybody has the kind of money to be able to pay their bail understand is that you know

173
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
One of the things that

174
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,039
Most people who are in jail have in common is that they're poor

175
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
And so for these

176
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,951
Yeah individuals having $1,000 bail or $2,500 bail

177
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,511
It might as well have been $1000000 bail

178
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
It's a pretty serious flaw it's built right into the Legal Sea

179
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
Bail is way harder on poor people in Amazon

180
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,775
Okay so that's lawyer number one or number two is a guy named Ellie home

181
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,639
He's the Assistant Attorney General in New Jersey is in charge of criminal prosecution to the entire state

182
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,687
And he had a completely different

183
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Problem of the Bells

184
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,063
4him the real trouble with how the bail system treated rich people

185
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,647
The right to bail was enmeshed in the New Jersey

186
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,975
State constitution we had a constitutional provision that said

187
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
Every criminal defendant is entitled to bail.

188
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,143
There's some people Ellie says who just should not be allowed to post bail at all

189
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
When you're looking at the leader of

190
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,287
A racketeering Enterprise a Mafia Family a large drug trafficking organization

191
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
You could have a

192
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,383
Kingpin somebody who's dangerous somebody you charged with murders

193
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
Now those folks can come up with money

194
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,783
Add the notion that those people could have could buy their way out of jail

195
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
Was really problematic

196
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
There's a reason Ellie gets so worked up about

197
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
He used to be a federal process

198
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
And the FEDS

199
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
Do not have Allah

200
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
Like the one in New Jersey that says Everybody Must Get

201
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:36,959
Ellie's new boss is New Jersey Governor Chris Christie he used to be a federal prosecutor he's used to the federal system

202
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
In 2012

203
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,311
He proposed a constitutional amendment in New Jersey

204
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,871
Create something called preventive detention

205
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Basically

206
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,967
Giving judges the right to hold somebody without any bail what's up

207
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
New Jersey

208
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
They didn't go for

209
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
His plan did not make it out of the way

210
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,903
To Roseanne Scotti the lawyer who's trying to make the whole system more fair

211
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
Chrissy's playing just look like a classic Law and Order

212
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
Exactly what you did

213
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
Expect from a prosecutor who is now a politician

214
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,399
We thought that preventive detention alone

215
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
Would not

216
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,823
In any way solve the problem will probably make things worse because you would have preventive detention as a new

217
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
New tool to keep people

218
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
I'm in jail

219
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,551
Jail by the way is where you wait for trial or serve short sentences prison is for people who are serving longer sentence

220
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
For folks like Scotty the problem was

221
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
But there were too many people in

222
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Not tfue

223
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
To try to make a case

224
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,279
She got her hands on the jail population data for the entire stay

225
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
In looking at the population we found that 40% of the people who were in hard shells were there

226
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Solely

227
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,567
Because they lack the money for often nominal amount of money bail

228
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Literally

229
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Thousands of people

230
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
If you haven't been convicted of anything

231
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,479
Sitting in jail waiting for their trials

232
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
Just because they were poor

233
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
And that weight was not trivial

234
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,415
The average length of time for someone who had officially been indicted but hadn't yet gone to trial

235
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
What's 314 days

236
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
That's 10 months

237
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,863
Well people are sitting in there in jail for months and sometimes years

238
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,959
You know they're losing jobs are losing family there use it losing housing

239
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
All that time in jail is obviously bad

240
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
In and of itself

241
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
No one wants to just sit in jail

242
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
But on top of that

243
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
You can start the change

244
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
Actual legal outcome

245
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
Weather people end up being found

246
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
Guilty or innocent

247
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Prosecutors are not

248
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
They know that people just want to go home

249
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
And they know that that give them a lot of

250
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,279
There is a phenomenon which I think you're not supposed to talk about publicly but I will

251
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,375
I called the time served and what that man is you would have defendants

252
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
Who would be held on low money Bells

253
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
Couldn't post it and they would sit there in

254
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Jail for

255
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
346 months

256
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,615
And then when it came out to make your next appearance their lawyer would say

257
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
You been in 6 months

258
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,943
If you take this please you walk out today

259
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,759
And so you got that plate was an easy way to get please

260
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
How come in a pack

261
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Very,

262
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,903
I mean I think it happened probably in every County

263
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,207
Across the state so first

264
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
You get punished

265
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
Then

266
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,047
At the end of your jail time

267
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
They figure out whether or not you actually did it

268
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
It's a crazy system

269
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
4

270
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
You can just plead guilty even if

271
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,823
You're not since that means you got to go home now instead of waiting however many more months it isn't

272
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
Tell your trial

273
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
This was

274
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Such

275
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:31,551
A terribly broken unfair appalling system it was such

276
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,623
You know just bald

277
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,439
Naked Injustice and angrily corrupt

278
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
The corrupt system

279
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,047
In 2013 was an organization put out a report

280
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
They basically said

281
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,911
This is how screwed up New Jersey's bail system is

282
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
Now I don't want to sound cynical but

283
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,775
Usually a report is where stories like this

284
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
And well-intentioned organization.

285
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Report

286
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,431
Joe Rose does a heart-rending NPR story

287
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,503
Everyone shakes their heads

288
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
And they say Dad is

289
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
Right

290
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Can we just move on to the

291
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
But nothing really

292
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
It's nothing changed

293
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
But in New Jersey

294
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
The report copy I of

295
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,791
The Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court

296
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
He calls everyone into his ceremonial

297
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
The judges

298
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
The public defenders

299
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
The ACLU the prosecutor Deli

300
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Ellie's in the room

301
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
And he tells them

302
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Fix it

303
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Lot of lawyers

304
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,711
So we got some people say you got a lot of wires together they can't get nothing done I think this is it

305
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,271
An example to the contrary we got quite a bit done

306
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
All those lawyers came up

307
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
To get rid of bail altogether

308
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
After the break

309
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
What was in that

310
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,999
How do you replace a system that we've been relying on 400

311
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
Support for this podcast

312

Come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

314
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
Developing solution

315
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
It support strong families and communities

316
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
To help ensure a brighter future for America's children

317
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
More information

When is available at aecf. Org

319
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
The most obvious proud

320
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
Problem with getting rid of bail

321
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,831
Is figuring out a new way of deciding who gets out before their trial and who stays locked

322
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
Ellie says the old system

323
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Was bad

324
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
But

325
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,487
It was simple under our old system the first thing a judge would do

326
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,559
Check the bucket the charge against the defendant look at the chart and say

327
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Okay his money bail is X

328
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
Post-it he walks out

329
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,959
If not he sits in jail until trial

330
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
Judges have a problem

331
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,799
If you take away the bail and bail chart

332
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,407
What are they supposed to do I don't know maybe use actual information about the real world

333
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Oh

334
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
You mean like data

335
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
I mean

336
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Big

337
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Oh Big Daddy

338
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,111
Researchers have been trying to solve this problem

339
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
4 years

340
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
Before New Jersey start messing around with

341
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
Is there a team of researchers

342
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
I'm the Laura and John Arnold Foundation

343
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
They get the data of a million and a half

344
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
Cases from all around the country

345
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Any run that data through a bunch of

346
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Statistical now

347
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
And they create something called

348
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
A risk assessment

349
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,103
This algorithm basically predicts

350
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
How likely somebody is

351
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
To fail to show up to court

352
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
And How likely they are to commit a new

353
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
At the risk assessment

354
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
Is automatically run

355
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:15,135
And immediately spits out a result of 126

356
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,951
I on two different scales one being low sex being high

357
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
It's not even that,

358
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
The algorithm just look sitting

359
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
Does the defendant have a

360
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,863
Prior conviction for a crime of violence

361
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,215
Has that conviction occurred within the past X number of years

362
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
You know what has the defendant had

363
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,103
Failure to appear or bench warrant issued in Prior case

364
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,943
Interesting Lee one of the factors is how old the defendant

365
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
At the time the crime was committed

366
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,319
If your under the age of 23 says the algorithm

367
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,903
You're actually more likely to commit a new crime and somebody who is older

368
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,975
Not everyone thought this algorithm though it was such a good idea

369
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
The reactions to

370
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
2 to the risk assessment tool were interesting

371
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,607
And I think it's fair to say that it first

372
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
There was

373
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
Pretty Broad skepta

374
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
First reason for the skepticism

375
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,775
The whole thing just seemed a little like sci-fi

376
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,103
I think of the movie Minority Report with Tom Cruise where

377
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,199
You know if they feed the information to these cyborgs like beings who predict

378
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
Future and that makes

379
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:18,879
The precogs and that makes people uneasy reconstitute future and they're never wrong ever get any false positives

380
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:25,279
Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife but they never go through with it out of the precogs tell the difference

381
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,679
And it is weird right like the algorithm

382
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:36,031
Looks at all this information about you like have you committed a crime before did you skip your

383
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Glass Court

384
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
And it says

385
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
Okay there's a

386
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
40% chance that

387
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,455
You are going to commit a new crime before your trial

388
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
So you have to stay locked

389
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,831
Stuff because of something you haven't done something you might do in the future

390
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
And I just feel compelled to point out here that

391
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
Precogs

392
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
They weren't always right

393
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,719
That was the whole point of the movie

394
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
It's the future hasn't happened yet

395
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,863
But okay when you compare this system to one that depended on bail and bail charts

396
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
This one looks pretty good

397
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
Because now people are being detained

398
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
Based on real information

399
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
About the risk of

400
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
The community

401
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
About the chances if they won't show up

402
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
There is a second concern

403
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
The people have about this risk assessment

404
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
When it comes down to buy us

405
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
People complain that the old system was biased

406
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
Against poor people and

407
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
What color

408
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:26,207
And what's to stop a new tool that's based on Big Data from being just as biased against

409
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
The same people

410
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
I asked Roseanne Scotti.

411
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,863
She's the lawyer who fought her entire life to make the justice system more just

412
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:38,239
She loves the tool she says the algorithm was specifically designed to avoid the bias

413
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:43,871
I think the key is what it doesn't look at you know some folks were concerned that it would look at

414
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
It would be a proxy for race

415
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,319
And things like that which it is in it does not look at your ZIP code or where you live or your neighborhood

416
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,647
Scotty says the algorithm is just as good at identifying risk

417
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,695
For rich people as it is for poor people

418
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
Black people as it is for white

419
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
Great idea right

420
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
Just get rid of bail

421
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
Replace it with the algorithm

422
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
No brainer

423
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,679
Everyone is going to love

424
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
Well

425
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
Everyone except

426
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
The Bayland

427
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Partly because

428
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,615
It's going to destroy their business entirely because it's going to destroy their business

429
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,151
They lobbied superhard

430
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Keep these changes

431
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,943
From becoming law

432
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
They warned about the crazy tsunami of crime

433
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Wipeout

434
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
The state got rid of

435
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,367
The fight pass this law was in

436
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,183
Hence we were still counting votes the morning of

437
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
It was really not

438
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
Hold the last vote quiz called that we knew we had

439
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
Roseanne and Elli and all the other reformers

440
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
They did win.

441
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
The old system is gone

442
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
There is essentially

443
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
No more cash bail

444
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,591
Remember Mustafa from the beginning of the show

445
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Under the old system

446
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
She got help

447
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
3 months in jail

448
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
On $50,000 bill

449
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,247
If you want to stop at

450
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
To the new algorithm

451
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
This is what you get

452
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
No prior offenses as an adult

453
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
No bench warrant

454
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
On the right side of 23 years old when he was arrested

455
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
She's A1

456
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
The lowest score on the wrist

457
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,559
That means under the new system

458
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,119
Usafa almost certainly gets to go home

459
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
Instead of having to spend all that time locked up

460
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Maybe he doesn't lose his job

461
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
Maybe he gets to go to his cousin's funeral

462
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,567
That's the new reality in New Jersey

463
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,895
You look at who's in jail and there is this real ship

464
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
More and more

465
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,223
The people who are locked up in jail

466
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,271
Are the ones who have been convicted of

467
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,319
Crimes instead of just accused of

468
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,391
Roseanne Scotti the lawyer who's been working for decades

469
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Make the criminal justice

470
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
System Warfare

471
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
She says this is easily one of the biggest achievements

472
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Of her career

473
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
When we got the

474
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
First

475
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Statistics

476
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
In February

477
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,239
That show that the jail population had been reduced

478
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
I'm by almost 30%

479
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
I cried

480
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
That was

481
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
An amazing moment to know that

482
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
You know you had done something

483
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:01,087
We're so many people were now going to go home to their families are

484
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
Communities

485
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,927
And to know that you had made a difference in

486
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
So many people would not

487
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,303
Face that Injustice

488
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,703
Was very profound more and more

489
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
In New Jersey

490
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Punishment

491
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,895
After conviction not before it

492
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,247
Hey it's Joel again back here in 2018 with an update

493
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,831
It's been more than 18 months since New Jersey's bail overhaul 2

494
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
And basically

495
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
It's working

496
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
Almost no one gets cash bail in New Jersey

497
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
The first 12 months

498
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Happened just

499
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
44 *

500
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Out of 10

501
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
Thousands of cases

502
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
But not Everyone likes the new law

503
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
The bail bonds industry

504
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
They still hate

505
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
The challenge the New Jersey Law in court

506
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
But that case

507
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
It was thrown out

508
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
We've also heard concerns from activists

509
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Search for Criminal Justice Reform

510
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
They say the risk assessment

511
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,087
Tool that thing that replaced money Bale May itself be biased on the basis of race

512
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,671
What we know for sure is that the states jail population

513
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Is way down

514
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
Almost 25

515
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Percent

516
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
And the sky

517
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Hasn't fallen

518
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,839
Crime is going down to

519
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:25,823
WE Post every episode on Facebook
