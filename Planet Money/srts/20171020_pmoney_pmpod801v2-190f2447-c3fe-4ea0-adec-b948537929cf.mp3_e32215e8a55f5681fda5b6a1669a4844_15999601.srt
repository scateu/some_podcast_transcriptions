00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
Grave as a sign

69
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
I remember

70
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
Rodney Dangerfield

His inscription there goes the neighborhood

73
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,736

79
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792

The great mystery

83
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
It connects and unites us all

84
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:30,944
It is inspired some of the greatest works of art and literature and in a lot of ways it defines and shapes Our Lives

85
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
But it is also a business

86
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:39,904

Carrie plot and story because you loved the Westwood Cemetery so much

102
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679

With plot brokers

106
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
So you're basically

107
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,687
Like a real estate agents for grave plots

108
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479

00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Aaron bias

2 spot it is a double plot

115
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023

And

117
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
It cost

118
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
Get ready for it

Spent a lot of money this guy probably have a reality show

122
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
Krista mausoleums of the

Rich and famous

124
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,015
I would watch that show up bear in Stanley has been in this business for more than

125
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
Because it is a very solid business

126
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,671
Demand is stable and there's a lot of money involved

127
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,999
Barons most expensive property right now is

128
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,559
Crypt that is going for more than a million dollars

129
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
What are the amenities that offer

130
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Likewise

131
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
Private entrance

132
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
One of a kind

133
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
You know 18-foot ceilings

134
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Marble

135
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Florida

136
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Ceiling

137
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
Family name

138
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,735
As big as a freeway sign Stacy

139
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
In Hollywood

140
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Even in death

141
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Billing

142
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Helen Parr

143
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Always

144
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
But this Cemetery

145
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
It's already at 95%

146
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Tank capacity

147
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
So it's really expensive

148
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
Hard to get in

149
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
Is there a certain cities like Los Angeles and New York

150
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,887
Businesses like his are always blooming

151
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,983
Necessities are growing populations are getting bigger cemeteries are filling up

152
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,335
More and more people are coming to him asking for help finding space

153
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,455
And Cemetery real estate is different from say home real estate in one very big way

154
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,015
You never move

155
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:19,903
Thanks and I are welcome

156
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:29,887
So you have your cemetery plot

157
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
But

158
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
When are you going to need

159
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,055
That question brings us to our second story because none of us knows when we are going to

160
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
Dianthus causes all kinds of problems

161
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
Existential of course

162
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
But also practice

163
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Princess

164
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
It's hard to know how much money you need to

165
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,087
To say if you don't want to scrimp and scrape your whole life only to die before you had

166
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,951
You also don't want to spend and spend and then live to be a hundred and twelve

167
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
These days we have things like

168
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Like 401ks

169
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Life insurance

170
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
What is problems

171
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
But that was not always the case

172
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,983
And brynhurst at editor of Planet Money you have a tail for

The ten of us weed Pony up $1,000

178
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
That's why

179
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
It's enough we bury it in the park

180
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
And we wait

181
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
And after everyone but one of us has died

182
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879

183
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
That person

Water it is

190
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
But it's actually a kind of deal that went on for

191
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
For centuries and it is called

192
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
A tontine

193
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
Constantine

194
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,455
It was invented by a man named Lorenzo de tonti exactly

195
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
Okay he wanted the money to go to the government

196
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
And he said

197
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
Listen Planet money investors

198
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
Don't bury the park

199
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Give it to me

200
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,695
Give it to the government and we will pay you an interest

201
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Once a year

202
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
And as investors in the tontine

203
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
Die off

204
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
The interest payments

205
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
Get bigger for the remaining

206
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,727
That's why you and I would get a regular paint

207
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
And even if everyone else is gone

208
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Will you take any money

209
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,127
So if Jacob Goldstein mysteriously disappears

210
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Blood say

211
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Princeton

212
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
We would get a little extra money to get a little extra money

213
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,831
Was this popular were there a lot of clear all over the place

214
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,647
And one of them for a while was the building that housed the New York Stock

215
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,975
Exchange it was really I was founded around 1794

216
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,023
By 200 people who got together

217
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
As I let each put in $200

218
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Will build a building will run it

219
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
And the survivors

220
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
The Survivor will on it

221
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,287
And when it shut down it was a big deal and it was like all the time teen is over the famous hunting is over

222
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,895
Who won who got the building with somebody with a very fancy old New York name

223
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,431
Of course

224
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
Why are some people who always win

225
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
It's okay these were apparently

226
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,575
Huge but I don't know what happened to them

227
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
Are there still tontines today

228
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
There were

229
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
I know there was some problems

230
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
What happened was

231
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,631
The insurance company's got into the business and they started offering tontines and a kind of professional way

232
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
And people joined up

233
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
And there was all this

234
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
Invested money sitting in piles

235
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
And

236
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,103
People didn't really do that good a job taking care of it

237
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
And it's

238
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,687
Tentative

239
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,551
And some people lived a long time and found out at the last moment

240
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
If you know what I mean

241
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
That someone had run off with all them

242
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
Oh

243
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Stoughton teens

244
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Became

245
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
Essentially illegal

246
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
But you're hoping to bring the back of hand

247
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
Think about it this way it's kind of a nice thing like

248
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
It's something you do with someone you trust

249
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:46,239
And you can't make an agreement that in a way is good for everyone

250
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,287
I think there's a kind of sweetness to it

251
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943
Thank you you're welcome

252
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,695
Our third and final business of death story

253
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,743
Comes to us from overseas

254
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,327
Sally helm Planet Money producer hello hello

255
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
You have the story for us yes

256
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
We are going to

257
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:22,335
And has a really good place to talk about death because it is one of the fastest aging Societies in the world right now

258
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
I talked to Alicia

259
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Cute about this

260
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,223
She covers Japan for MPR and she was like oh yeah

261
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
There's a lot of old

262
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,111
People in Japan and it's noticeable when you walk around especially rural areas

263
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
So what does that mean for the funeral

264
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,767
Well you would think it would be a good thing right you was upset and that would be the

265
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
Kind of intuitive

266
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,863
Response but what's happening is that others there's kind of

267
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,167
Larger Trend against

268
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
Spending as much money on funerals

269
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
And having smaller funeral

270
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,823
There are a couple reasons for that Trend one kind of

271
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,943
Sad one is that if you died older you have fewer friends around to come to your funeral

272
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
So

273
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,551
What's happening in Japan is that on the one hand there are more funerals

274
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
But on the other hand people are spending less

275
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
On each one

276
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,999
So the funeral and death is in Japan has gotten really really competitive

277
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
And there a Benny's big expose

278
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
Where death businesses

279
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,375
Come together to

280
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
Basically show their stuff

281
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
Show white people should choose

282
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Them

283
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
And Elise

284
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Went to one of those conventions

285
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
It's called index

286
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,223
Short for end-of-life Expo and it's a gathering of all end-of-life related

287
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Businesses

288
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
So coffin builders

289
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,391
Alter makers morticians there was an entire section on pets

290
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
Turn your

291
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:47,327
Pet remains into a memory Sapphire there were a bunch of purses on display there was a swill blinged-out hers

292
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
Example why would you need

293
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
A party bus

294
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
Elise

295
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Did not just

296
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,823
Go to this Expo she actually

297
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
Participated in it

298
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,271
There was a mortician there who wanted to show off his skills in traditional Japanese burial practices

299
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Is and

300
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
Elise agreed to be his model

301
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Oh my God

302
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
The big

303
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Climax

304
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,487
For me at a 10 deck

305
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Was

306
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,095
An opportunity to actually have an Undertaker

307
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:25,471
I pretend that I was dead and dressed me in the traditional funeral garb

308
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
And put me in a coffin

309
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:34,175
At least at the Undertaker wrapped her in a kimono left side over right side the way you would do it for the Dead

310
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
And applied makeup and

311
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
All of this was in front of a big

312
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Audience

313
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
There's a real ritual to all of this

314
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
And so while I was pretending to

315
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Will be dead and getting

316
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Prepared for

317
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
My coffin

318
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
This

319
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,119
Undertaker was also on display right that we were on stage

320
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,447
And so there was somebody narrating what he was doing

321
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:03,871
Olicity Undertaker was very gentle with seem like you really knew what he was doing

322
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,687
When we were all finished there was a lot

323
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
You know Ford

324
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
For the ritual mortician

325
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
I have a photo at this

326
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
In front of me and

327
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:19,487
Amazing Elise has on makeup she's in this coffin that has

328
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Cloud

329
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
On it

330
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
End

331
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
You know if that is a business

332
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
In this case police

333
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
Became the product

334
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
And she told me that the experience wasn't really

335
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:35,615
Spiritual for her if she was in touch with anything larger than herself it was

336
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
The commercial side of death

337
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Which

338
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Ultimately

339
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
Unites all

340
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
That is so true

341

374
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
He is a

375
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,839
Cemetery commissioner in a small town in Mass

376
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
So he

377
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
Runza Municipal Cemetery

378
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
Keeps track of who's buried where he

379
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
Sunblock time of grieving families

380
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
So he's really dealing with a lot of different

381
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
Logistical aspects

382
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,919
Pics of dad really practical Parts in this small town

383
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,479
And he's been doing it since he was 18 years old

384
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,831
So I thought he would be the perfect person to ask this question that

385
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
Army has been

386
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
How to hanging over the whole show

387
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Which is

388
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
If you're dealing with death in this

389
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Practical way

390
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,559
Does that make it easier for you

391
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
To deal with your own mortality

392
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
So I asked

393
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Do you feel like you've learned

394
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Things about death that you didn't know

395
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
I've learned a lot of technical

396
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
Aspects of it

397
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,615
I didn't realize say that I casket

398
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,711
Colors inside of a vault when it goes in the ground I thought they just went straight into the ground

399
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,783
Do you think I mean like has it changed how you

400
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,087
I like to think about death do you think

401
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
No I'm still terrified

402
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
So I guess no matter how often you deal with death

403
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,351
However many of the Practical parts of death you're dealing with everyday

404
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
It's still just the Great

405
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Existential question

406
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
Yeah

407
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
I think that never goes out
