And of course shipping

19
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,112
I doubt they're going to let me in but I'm going to ask

20
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,768
I'm driving up to a private golf course about an hour north of Manhattan and before they let you and you have to stop

21
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,792
Guard house

22
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,328
Hi how are you

23
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,704
Hey I'm I am a reporter with NPR and I'm doing a story about

24
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
The 13th hole on this golf course is there any chance that I can just look at that

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,432
It goes away

26
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
Ask his boss

27
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:57,856
Comes back and tells me nope I'm sorry you need an appointment okay no problem

28
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01,184
Thank you the reason Karen was at this golf course

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,952
It was because

30
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
We heard that something

31
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,536
It's our had happened on that 13

32
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
It was during a charity golf tournament

33
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
Back in 2000

34
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,448
And while I never did get into that Golf Course

35
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,776
We did manage to find someone who has not only

36
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,360
Qingdao 13th hole she was actually there during the

37
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,128
Entire anthem

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,480
How many charity golf tournaments would you say you think you've been to in your life

39
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,320
I've probably been to ya dozens of them if not I'm hundreds

40
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
This is Patricia Hannigan

41
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
She writes about golf including

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
Charity events

43
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,280
Any other of those that you've been to ended quite like this

44
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
Absolutely not

45
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
Patricia tells me

46
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,704
The day of this charity golf tournament it was a kind of muggy day this is

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
August

48
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,312
And it started out like a normal charity golf tournament

49
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
The early

50
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
The crowd there was a group of hostesses there and I saw them they were a bunch of implausibly beautiful girls also

51
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
Therefore the tournament you had

52
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
The basketball players and you had

53
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
The guys food

54
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
Had a certain look

55
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
But said heads

56
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
Anuradha

57
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,280
She declined to describe what the hedge funds are looking

58
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
We can assume it probably meant

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Rich people

60
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
And that is not uncommon for

61
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Charity golf tournament

62
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
However if the basketball players is a little unusual

63
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
But not for this event

64
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,360
Because this was a fundraiser for the Alonzo Mourning

65
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Family found

66
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
If you do not know

67
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
Who wants a warning is I'm sorry for you

68
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,064
She's one of the greatest basketball players of all time he play for the Miami Heat

69
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
Is a 7 time

70
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,160
All-Star he won a championship

71
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
Did she really stop

72
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,024
The event kicks off and Patricia

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Heads out to the course

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
And decides

75
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,400
She's going to spend the entire day at the 13th hole

76
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
That

77
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
13th hole

78
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,360
Which was the whole with the waterfall and the hold it was designated for this million-dollar shootout

79
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
Dollar shoot

80
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,480
Now this is apparently a staple of rich people golf

81
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:05,600
Razors if you donate a little bit of extra money then there is a designated hole where

82
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
Get hole in one

83
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
You win a million bucks

84
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,536
The odds of an amateur golfer doing that getting a hole-in-one I am told Art

85
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,072
12000 to 1

86
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
But just in case it does

87
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
Happened Patricia wants to be there

88
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,264
So she sits down at the 13th hole and starts watching

89
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
Sweetheart first golfer of

90
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Stay up

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
Tr4a

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176
After golfer comes through terrible shot

93
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,272
And it does not get a hole-in-one

94
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,344
Patricia sits there for a very long time

95
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,416
I have to say it had been getting a little bit

96
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
Doll

97
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
She's seen about seven or eight groups

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,120
Scott's through when it's one guy walks up to the tee and sort of seemed a little bit more like um

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,032
Maybe a Pioneer in the field that's for that way but what does that mean a Pioneer in the field and perhaps he'd been

100
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,360
Doing whatever it was he was doing for 4

101
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Quite a long time

102
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Everything he's older

103
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
Oh boy I don't like

104
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,808
This is the nicest way I've ever heard

105
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
I called old

106
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Anyway

107
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,160
The man's name was Martin Greenberg

108
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
And he walks

109
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,256
Up to the Tee Martin Greenberg

110
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
Pioneer in his field

111
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
All Odds

112
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Martin Greenberg

113
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,191
Hits a hole-in-one on the million-dollar

114
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
13 tall

115
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
And all my playing

116
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,543
I've never witnessed a hole in one

117
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,359
Even been at a tournament I think we're anyone made it home

118
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:36,479
How do people celebrate on a golf course do you do people clap and scream and shout or is that not

119
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Okay

120
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
You got the golf clap

121
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,367
Which is kind of a restrained

122
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
Constipated like that

123
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
But not today people were jumping

124
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,839
And hugging because Martin Greenberg had just one

125
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119

Couple of weeks before I really heard that there's something had gone

129
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871

Well

169
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,839

Who witnessed it

190
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Including a cop who's

191
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,687
Job was to stand at the 13th hole the entire day

192
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,319
For a million dollars they have to have a law enforcement officer witness it which they did

193
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:25,695
Mark also send an investigator to the course to meet with the man who hit the hole in one

194
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Martin Greenberg

195
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,023
They escorted him out to

196
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
The whole world made a hole-in-one

197
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,399
And they asked him to identify the spot where he hid it from

198
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
Martin Greenberg points to the team Ark

199
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
Where's the place you're supposed to hit the ball from

200
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
And when the investigator measures

201
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,871
The tee markers are 150 yards from the

202
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
And this is critic

203
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,223
Because the rule from the insurance company is that

204
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
If the person hits from any closer than 150

205
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
2 yards

206
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
The insurance company does not have to

207
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
It it's all over our contract

208
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,767
It's all over the Box we ship the signs in its on the sign itself

209
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,351
You know we do everything possible to try and alert

210
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
The person that setting up that hole

211
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,215
So Mark takes all of this evidence back to what

212
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
We like to imagine must be some like hole-in-one in the

213
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
Station lab and

214
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
He goes to the evidence and

215
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,895
Looking good everything is checking out

216
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
But then

217
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
He pulls up that video of the Holy

218
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,039
And in the Hollywood version of

219
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
This is where the

220
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
Ominous music would start

221
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
Playing and Mark would look up from that video

222
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
And say

223
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
God

224
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:37,631
The yardage that yardage was quite a bit substantially shorter than 150 yards

225
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,727
The video showed Martin Greenberg hitting the hole in one

226
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,055
From tee markers that were set at only 100

227
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,591
39 yards

228
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
But after the event when the investigator measures

229
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
Those same team markers

230
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
We're at 100 and

231
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
50 yard

232
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
That means

233
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
It's sometime

234
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,671
Between the actual hole-in-one in the hole-in-one investigation

235
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
Those tee markers were

236
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Move

237
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
After the event

238
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Back

239
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:14,239
I have tried so hard to figure out who set up that tea and who moved it back

240
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,079
Serial season 4 anybody call me

241
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
Sadly I do not know

242
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Because Martin

243
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,991
And his lawyers and actually Alonzo Mourning none of them would talk to

244
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
And to be clear

245
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
We are not a legend

246
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,415
Did Martin Greenberg or anyone else did anything intentionally deceptive here

247
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,767
But here is a theory that sources have proposed

248
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
To us about how this

249
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
Might have had

250
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
A hole-in-one

251
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Is just

252
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
So rare

253
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,239
Maybe whoever was in charge of setting up the tea

254
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Tease

255
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Was just a little too casual about

256
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,871
He might have delegated that to someone else

257
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
Sue delegated it to someone else

258
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
Who forgot to tell their dog to delegated

259
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
To someone else

260
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,367
Alright kids listen up delegate delegate clearly

261
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,671
To the T get set up in the wrong place

262
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
Ends and the golf staff innocently move those

263
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
T markers

264
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,583
Back 250 yards for the next day

265
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
Or

266
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,703
Maybe somebody instigates a million-dollar hole-in-one cover up

267
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
We do not know

268
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
What we do know

269
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
For sure

270
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,847
Is it someone owed Martin Greenberg

271
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
$1000000

272
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
And it was not

273
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
The insurance

274
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:32,575
And this case we had to deny the claim based on the artist who was that the end of it for you

275
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,415
And then they pick it up from there

276
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,535
Any attorneys get involved right then everybody start singing everybody

277
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
And sure enough

278
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Martin Greenberg

279
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Starts

280
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
And this

281
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
Turns into a lawsuit that got so complicated

282
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
I had to make like

283
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,871
Serial killer flowchart out of Post-it notes across my cubicle just to sort out how it got

284
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,199
This is true it looks like Karen is like about to catch the zodiac

285
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
That's nextaff

286
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
Martin Greenberg sued

287
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
The Alonzo Mourning Foundation

288
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
The event management company

289
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
The hole-in-one Insurance Company

290
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
And

291
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
The company that owns

292
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
The golf course

293
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
The Trump

294
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
National

295
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
Golf Club

296
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
The owner of which of course

297
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
Is President Donald J Trump

298
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
And when the lawsuit dust

299
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Settled

300
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
Martin Greenberg did get paid

301
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
By the Alonzo Mourning foundation and the

302
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Foundation

303
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Those private Foundation

304
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,431
Paid into Martin Greenberg private Foundation

305
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
But here's the thing

306
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
That improbable hole-in-one

307
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
Mysterious moving tee marker the

308

Hole-in-one investigators

309
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
It all could have just been

310
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
Wacky rig

311
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951

313
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
The actual investigators started

314
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
New York attorney general

315
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
Has just announced the lawsuit

316
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167

President Trump

340
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:31,359
Paid his portion of the million-dollar hole-in-one settlement from his private Foundation

341
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
The Donald J Trump Foundation

342
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,759
He opened this foundation in 1989 and has used it to donate money all kinds of

343
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Things like

344
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
The United Way the

345
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
New York Police Athletic League the Metropolitan

Art

347
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
His smallest donation ever

348
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
$7

349
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
Boy Scouts of America yes that is

350
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
$7 not 7000

351
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,119
And one of his biggest donations

352
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
200

353
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
And $64,000

354
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,751
To something that I took Kenny to see in person

355
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
We're standing

356
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
I'm a very busy Corner in Manhattan

357
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
On the edge of Central Park

358
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,783
And somewhere around here is one of his biggest donations ever

359
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
Hi-5 donation

360
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:18,463
Well I see some pigeons I see some art Etsy

361
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,071
This China founded

362
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
This mountain is in front of the famous Plaza Hotel

363
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:32,799
And back in 1989 Donald Trump own The Plaza Hotel and this Fountain was crumbling

364
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
And technically the fountain belong

365
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
What's the city of New York

366
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
But they didn't want to

367
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:43,295
Fix it so local businesses pitched in money including a big donation from the trunk found a

368
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
And this is

369
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,135
Arguably how philanthropy is supposed to

370
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
We agree to give

371
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,767
Private foundations a tax break we agree to reduce our tax return

372
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
On the promise

373
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
That

374
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,399
These philanthropists will use that money to benefit Society

375
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
I'm sure this Fountain benefited Trump's hotel

376
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:07,871
But also the rest of us including apparently Kenny Kenny Malone might be taking out his

377
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:13,247
Socks and waiting into the fountain

378
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
This Fountain this donation and

379
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,135
All of Trumps donations they are being scrutinized

380
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
Much more heavily now that he is present

381
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
And this is how the New York

382
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
Attorney general got interested in

383
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
And how Donald Trump

384
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Settled that

385
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
Million-dollar hole-in-one

386
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
Debacle

387
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,447
What we are alleging is that

388
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
This

389
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
Trump Foundation

390
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,567
Violated a number of laws

391
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
Of the state of New York that govern the way

392
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
Foundation a non-profit

393
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
Corporation

394
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,831
Is required to govern itself this is the New York attorney general Barbara Underwood on

395
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
CNN

396
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
Talking about the lawsuit against

397
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
The Trump Foundation

398
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
The money

399
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Of that

400
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Foundation was

401
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
Distributed for

402
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
Impermissible purpose

403
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,095
Personal purposes

404
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Business purposes

405
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:07,775
Political campaign purposes rather than what happened on the 13th hole

406
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
She argues

407
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
Is one of those impermissible

408
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Martin Greenberg

409
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
Eric the guy who got the hole in one

410
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
He sued Donald Trump's Golf Course

411
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
Which is one of Trump's businesses

412
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
But then Donald Trump

413
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
Pay the legal settlement

414
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,879
Farthest hole-in-one with his tax

415
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Exempt from

416
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Foundation

417
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,511
The Attorney General claims that this is a violation that is known as

418
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,279
Self-dealing

419
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
Which just means that you

420
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,375
You cannot use your pool of tax-exempt

421
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Philanthropic money

422
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,215
As your own personal or business

423
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,543
There are several other charges as well in this way

424
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
Trump by-the-way denies wrong

425
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
He also declined to comment for our story

426
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,271
This lawsuit is still pending it is also been referred to the IRS and the

427
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
Federal Election Commission

428
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
So we don't know what

429
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
But

430
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,159
What all of this got us

431
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Curious about

432
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
Was this

433
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,767
Thing called a private Foundation

434
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
How many

435
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Are there

436
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:08,703
Do other people do questionable stuff with their private foundations like what are you even allowed to do with

437
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,543
So we started looking into the laws around private foundations

438
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335
It got a little complicated

439
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
But then we stumbled across

440
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,479
The official podcast of the Internal Revenue Service

441
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Which is amazing

442
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:27,647
The following is a fictitious discussion between coat the knowledgeable straight-talking IRS Revenue agent

443
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,439
From the website

444
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,743
In case you want to hear this entire thing

445
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
This episode is titled

446
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,607
The wonderful world of foundation classes

447
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Hey coach

448
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
It's been awhile

449
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
I'm glad to be back

450
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
Can I still request about coach

451
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,823
Yeah what is he is he a coach and what is he a coach of his attacks coach

452
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:49,151
Is named coach what is the cheese attacks coach for nonprofit

453
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
No

454
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Anyway

455
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
If you listen to coach

456
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
Long enough what you will learn is that

457
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,135
Private foundations are their very own category of nonprofit

458
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,999
Basically they're defined as a type of nonprofit where you have one or a few donors

459
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,303
Putting money into a tax exempt

460
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
Pool and

461
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
Private foundations

462
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
The government has decided

463
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Quite a bit of

464
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Extra babysit

465
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
Right coach

466
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,871
Are subject to a number of anti-abuse rules and excise tax

467
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
If it don't apply to public charities

468
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711
This extra scrutiny date back

469
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
The

470
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,647
When Congress discovered that private foundations were abusing their tax-exempt status more than any other kinds of

471
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Nonprofits

472
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
People were doing things like

473
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,279
Putting their money tax-free into their Foundation

474
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
And then lending themselves that Ma

475
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,399
Or maybe they would put their family on the board

476
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
And then they would have a board meeting

477
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
On the beach in the Bahamas

478
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,335
Congress was also worried that wealthy people were using their packs

479
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
Exempt money to gain too much power over politics

480
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
And socially

481
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
And so in 1969 the government said

482
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Private foundations

483
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,063
You get more rules

484
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
Then all other nonprofit

485
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
But it is of course

486
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
One thing to say

487
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
Say that private foundations

488
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
Need more monitoring

489
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
It is another to

490
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,559
Actually have enough resources to

491
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
To do that monitoring

492
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
Thousand or more

493
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
Foundations and then you have another

494
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:22,335
1.5 million nonprofits all of which are filing tax returns

495
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
This is David Callahan

496
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,919
He runs a publication called inside fillet

497
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,967
And you have a small

498
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,527
Comparatively small staff of

499
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
IRS

500
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,135
Officials are supposed to keep track of all that

501
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
And so

502
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,023
We don't really know how many of them are fully complying with the rules

503
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,839
They're actually now 109

504
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Thousand

505
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
Private Foundation

506
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
Any IRS has just

507
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
256

508
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Agents

509
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
Dedicated to monitor

510
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
The number of staff

511
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,871
Set the IRS has for monitoring all nonprofit

512
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
It's has been try

513
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Trending down

514
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
And so have the number of

515
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Nevada state

516
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
Thanks for

517
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:07,903
Probably most Charities are out there doing great work my senses the Trump Foundation is an outlier

518
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
On the other hand who really knows

519
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,255
Because the foundations

520
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,583
And of America receives a little scrutiny

521
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,655
It's hard to think that the Trump Foundation would have ever been

522
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,215
Crackdown on if he hadn't run for president

523
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
Yap certainly would not have

524
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,847
Then there would not have been scrutiny of the Trump Foundation

525
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,407
So if you have a private foundation and

526
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,711
Who knows maybe one day you want to run

527
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
For president

528
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,807
You should probably make sure that your you know your house is in order

529
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
And luckily

530
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
We know

531
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
Exactly

532
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
Who can help you

533
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Hey coach

534
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
Our time's up

535
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
If we want to know more about this topic what can we do

536
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,399
Publication 557 tax-exempt status for your organization has an exhausted

537
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
Some would say exhausting

538
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
Discussion of foundation classifications

539
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:00,127
