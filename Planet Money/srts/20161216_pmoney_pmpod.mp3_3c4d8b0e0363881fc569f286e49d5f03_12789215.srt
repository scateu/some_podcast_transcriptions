00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,040

A very good friend of Planet Money it comes Tim Harford is launching a new project

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,184

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,152
Is a step back in time

18
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,688
I am in a

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
Quiet corner of London

20
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
And I'm standing next

21
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,040
The Temple Church

22
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,576
Central London

23
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,368
Which is who

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,416
Nearly 900 years old

25
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464
Let's see if we can get into the church

26
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,864
So I can hear these ethereal Voice is coming from inside the temple I

27
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,216
Imagine this is a concert by rehearsing was a beautiful door in front of me

28
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,264
A wrought iron work on it

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
Anoka

30
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:22,688
And above me a call a man on the top of it is a statue metal statue of

31
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
2 nights

32
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,064
Sharing a single horse which I think represents a vow of poverty

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,648
These nights the long for medieval order that you've probably heard of

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
The Knights Templar

35
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,744
It was funny because what we know about the knights

36
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,584
Templar what I know but the Knights Templar is that I don't know much about the Knights Templar

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
Except they Bruna Dan Brown book right

38
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
Exactly right

39
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
Exactly right there's some sort of conspiracy I'm sure of it though I don't know what it is a numerous conspiracy and

40
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,176
Who knows maybe some of them a true but the reason I'm here is not because of any particular

41
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,016
Conspiracy I'm here because the church that I'm standing in front of

42
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
It's not just

43
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,112
A religious site is not just an architectural site

44
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,184
Temple Church in London first

Of his new podcast right now

62
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,936
It's the story of the Knights Templar

XI wristband

64
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,968
Knights Templar

65
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,368
Religious order with a physiologically inspired hierarchy mission statement and code of ethics

66
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,952
They will also heavily armed and dedicated to a holy war

67
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,048
How many times can rice get into the banking game

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,704
The Templars dedicated themselves to the defense of Christ

69
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem

70
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,336
Jerusalem has been captured by the first crusade in 1099

71
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,944
And pilgrims began to streaming traveling thousands of miles across Europe

72
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
If you're Christian pilgrim

73
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
Have a problem

74
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,880
I need to somehow found monks of food and transport in a combination

75
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464
But you also want to avoid carrying huge sums of cash around

76
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,512
Because that makes you a target for robbers

77
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,840
Fortunately the Templars have that covered

78
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
Pilgrim could leave his cash at Temple Church in London

79
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
Temperature in Jerusalem

80
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Instead of carrying cash

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
It carry a letter of credit

82
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,128
The Knights Templar with a Western Union

83
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
At The Crusade

84
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:07,808
We don't actually know how the Templars made this system work and protect themselves against fraud

85
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,416
Was there a secret code verifying the documents in the identity of the traveler

86
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
We can only guess

87
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,024
That wouldn't be the only mystery 2 shroud of the Templars

88
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,839
An organization sufficiently steeped in Legend

89
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399
The Dan Brown had a scene at The DaVinci Code

90
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Contempo

91
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
Church

92
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,263
Know where the Templars the first organization in the world

93
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
To provide such a

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
Several centuries area

95
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,151
Tang Dynasty China used phaquan

96
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Find money

97
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
Tupac documents

98
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
Allowing Merchants to deposit profits in a regional office

99
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
And we claim that

100
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
Back in the capital

101
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,159
But that system was operated by the government

102
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
Templars were much closer

103
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
Tattoo a private bank

104
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
Will be at the private bank owned by the Pope

105
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,119
Allied to Kings and princes across Europe

106
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
And run by a partnership of monks

107
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
Sworn to poverty

108
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,311
Knights Templar did much more than transferring money across long distances

109
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:05,663
They provided a range of recognized B Morton Financial Services

110
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,759
If you wanted to buy a nice island off the west coast of France

111
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,367
Something King Henry the 3rd of England Aid in the 1200 with the island of Alero

112
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
Northwestern Bordeaux

113
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
Well the Templars could broker the deal

114
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:23,327
King Henry the third page 200 pounds a year for five years to the temple in London

115
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,959
Then what his men took possession of the island the Templars made show the seller got paid

116
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,519
Oh when the crown jewels of England

117
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,567
Stool today at the Tower of London

118
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
In the 1200

119
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,895
The crown jewels were at the temple

120
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
It was security

121
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
On a loan

122
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,551
That was the Templars operating as a very high-end pawnbroker

123
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,647
Knights Templar were in Europe spank forever of course

124
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,231
Toyota lost its reason to exist after European Christians

125
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,279
Completely lost control of Jerusalem

126
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
In 1244

127
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,399
The Templars were eventually disbanded in 1312

128
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,239
But then who was to step into the banking vacuum

129
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,871
If you'd be in at the great Fair of Leon in 1555 you could have seen the answer

130
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
Leon's fair with the greatest market for internet

131
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
National trade in Old Europe

132
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
Contagion back to Roman times

133
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:22,463
Could this particular fire spread

134
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,791
Italian merchants

135
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,215
Keyboard nothing and you have nothing to sell

136
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
All he had was a desk

137
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
In an instant

Day of the day at the fair continue

Receiving other Merchants assignment pieces of paper

141
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
And somehow

142
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
Becoming very rich

143
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
Extraordinary

144
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
And frankly to the locals

145
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
Fairy suspects

146
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:59,583
Thought to a new international Elite of Europe's great Merchant houses

147
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,167
This particular Italian activities

148
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
He had a very important role

149
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
He was buying and selling debt

150
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,103
And in doing so he was creating enormous economic value

151
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,431
Here's how the system works

152
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,015
Dimension from Lyon who wanted to buy say

153
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
To go to this Bank

And borrow something cold a bill of Exchange

155
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
The bill of exchange was a credit note

156
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
Iru

157
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:32,095
These are you wasn't denominated in the French liberal the florentijn lyrics

158
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631

Icty nobody had ever heard of him

171
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
That's a valuable service

172
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,311
No wonder that the mysterious Bangkok was rich

173
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
Add every few months

Encephalo remaining debts

How Financial system today still has a lot in common with a cyst

181
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:39,935
An Australian with a credit card can walk into a supermarket in that say Leon why not

182
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
And she can walk out with groceries

183
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
The supermarket checks the French Bank

184
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,847
French pancakes with Australian Bank

185
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,151
Australian Bank approves the payment

186
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
Happy that this woman is good for the money

187
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,807
What is web of banking services has always had a dark side too

188
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,671
By turning personal obligations into internationally tradeable debts

189
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,767
These medieval Bankers were creating that own private money

190
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,095
I'm not private money with outside the control of Europe

191
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
Kings

192
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
They were rich

193
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
And Powerful

194
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
I didn't need the coins minted by the sovereign

195
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,823
That description brings true even today

196
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,383
International Banks are locked together

197
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
In a web of mutual obligations

198
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,991
The Define understanding or control

199
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,111
They can use the international reach to try to sidestep taxes and regulations

200
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,231
Since their debts to each other a very real kind of private money

201
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
When the banks are fragile

202
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,583
The entire monetary system of the world

203
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
Ulcer becomes fat

204
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,959
We still trying to figure out what to do with these Banks

205
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
We can't live without them it seems

206
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
And yet we not sure we want to live with them

207
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,663
Governments keep searching for ways to hold them in check

208
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,991
Sometimes the approaches be laissez-faire

209
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Sometimes no

210
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
Fuel Regulators have been quite is autumn

211
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
King Philip

212
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
Fourth of France

213
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
Fiat money to the Templars

214
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,047
And they refuse to forgive his debts

215
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
In 1307

216
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:16,447
I'm assigned to what is now the temple stop on the Paris Metro

217
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,263
King Philip launched the raid on the Paris Temple

218
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
Temples with tortured

219
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,383
Enforced confess any sin the Inquisition could imagine

220
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,455
The order of the Templars was disbanded by the Pope

221
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
The London Temple was rented out

222
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,343
I'm a lost Grand Master of the Templars

223
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
Jacques de molay

224
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
Was brought to the center of Paris

225
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
Publicly burned to death

226
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
That was Tim Harford

227
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:49,471
New podcast for the BBC World Service it's called 50 things that made the modern economy

228
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
And wherever you get your podcasts

230
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,151
Before we go I wanted to finish up our conversation with

231
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Tim Harford

232
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,783
Still Standing on the street corner in London

233
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,343
Do a chimpanzee great story of the first

234
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:11,743
Bank it's obviously one of the things you'd want if you were doing a series on 50 things that made the modern economy

235
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,351
But I knew some everything from the list are are some of stranger things you wouldn't think about like

236
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
The Barre code

237
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
How did you decide

238
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
What made the list and what did

239
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:26,335
What's the most important thing was to get 50 interesting things 50 things with a with a few surprises is awesome

240
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Supposed to be just

241
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
Got the 50 most important things

242
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
That I could think of

243
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
Open Temple the steam engine

244
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,855
He's not on the list of the computer is not on the list because they're not important

245
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
Yeah they just so well told

246
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,815
So I was looking for a spread of different Industries different ideas

247
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
Different parts of the world and different surprises

248
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
The Barre code

249
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
Is interesting

250
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
Not because it's a way of processing

251
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
Transactions more quickly

252
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,871
It's interesting because it changed the shape of global supply chain

253
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
It changed

254
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,967
Who was a winner and who was a loser in the retail industry

255
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,319
So that that's the kind of weird looking for the economic impact as well as just

256
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
I know the computer was in poor

257
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647

261
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,775
Who made the idea of selling consulting services to managers and why did a group of academics

262
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,127
Stop providing management consulting services free in India

263
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:37,503
