00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,992
Last Friday President Trump started a trade war with

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,088
Or maybe it started months ago or maybe we're not even in one yet

7
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,368
But regardless

8
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,392
He put tariffs

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,928
50 billion dollars worth of

10
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
Chinese.

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,768
Because we have to because we've been treated very unfairly

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,584
China responded by saying we're going to slap 50 billion dollars

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,608
The tariffs on you

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,168
Did President Trump gave a reason for this

15
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,984
He said that China steals from the US

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
The China

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,544
Steals our ideas

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
And our technology has proved

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,688
Trump mentioned this big report that was put together by the US trade representative

20
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
It's office

21
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
It came out of my

22
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
Tok here

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,368
This right here is the US trade Representatives report

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,208
You got a big binder clip and in between it is like

25
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
70 pages

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,376
Okay and it has insanely long name

27
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,960
Findings of the investigation into China's Acts

28
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
Policies and practices related to

29
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,288
To technology transfer

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,872
Intellectual property and Innovation under Section 301

31
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Of the trade Act

32
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:25,760
If 1974 is a banger with a thing in the report that I was really interested in

33
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
Is appendix

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
See

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,184
Because an appendix C there's a list of all the companies that have something to say about China

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,232
Including companies that are complaining about

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,584
But if you look at it carefully what you see is that instead of individual companies

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
There's mostly a lot of trade organ

39
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
Oh yeah the American Foundry

40
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
Society the biotechnology Innovation organization the motor equipment and manufacturers Association and

41
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
A bunch more

42
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,688
So I called and I emailed just about every Trade Organization on there

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,736
And I said can you put me in touch with

44
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
One company that can occur

45
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
Spleen what it looks like

46
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,368
When China steals or demands it

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Intellectual property or

48
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Technology

49
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Yeah

50
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,512
And he said sure just hang on I waited a couple of days

51
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
Emily mosto got back to me

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,632
Sorry but we can't find a company that's willing to talk to you

53
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
Which makes sense

54
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,752
Because probably a lot of these companies are doing business in China

55
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
And they have a lot to lose

56
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
But while I was combing through appendix

57
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
See I came across this

58
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,992
Little company that testified for the report and it actually used its name

59
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Noel King and I'm exhausted today on the show is China real

60
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
Stealing from the US we read this brick of a report that the president is using to justify his trade War

61
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:47,680
And buried inside we found this strange complicated and very personal story

62
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,240
Two men a businessman and a sign

63
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,848
Together they got hold of an invention that they thought might change the world

64
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
And together they hope to make a lot of money said they descended into suspicion accusations and loss

65
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,600
How do you feel right now about the professor

66
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
Well I mean

67
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
I don't

68
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Hate him

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
I don't trust him

70
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
And eventually they ended up in the pages of the Trump administration's report

71
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,432

How to receive $10 off your dress shirt

85
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,408
The tiny company in the middle of this huge trade war is called

86
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Bonomo's

87
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,248
So I called them up and I got the CEO at Rogers

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,600
And I said to him you know a lot of the companies in this report didn't want to use their name

89
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
I mean it always

90
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
Keep in the back of your mind

91
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
When you

92
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
Stand up or raise your hand that

93
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
You know somebody's going to

94
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Probably shoot at you but

95
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
In my opinion

96
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,167
To hide behind anonymity

97
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
Cowardly

98
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
So I went down to Virginia to meet this guy at Rodger

99
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,919
Ed Rogers looks so much like Mitt Romney that he was once mistaken for Mitt Romney at a Mitt Romney event

100
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,247
He's got kind of Romney by peers how he described himself

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
I mean I'm the kind of person

102
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
Who if I see you

103
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
Wall hanging

104
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
Slightly crooked I'll go

105
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
Straightened out

106
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:49,023
Would you be offended if I'm if I'm taping the story I described you as maybe a little bit Square

107
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
No I would not be offended

108
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
Describe me how are you

109
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
It is a little bit

110
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Square

111
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Anyway

112
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:02,079
Here is the story that Ed told the US trade representative for the report

113
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,943
And the story he told me it's also the subject of a criminal investigation and a couple of Lost

114
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,271
We read the legal documents and so here goes

115
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,319
It is July 2002

116
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:17,183
And in a laboratory in Blacksburg Virginia and amazing discoveries

117
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,743
He's made that was sorta like a Eureka moment

118
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,583
It was the CEO of the company that was working out of lab his boss

119
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,119
The owner of the company

120
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
With a scientist

121
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Edwardsib

122
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
So it wasn't in the lab that morning but the scientist

123
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Is his boss

124
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
Send to miss email at 10:37 a.m.

125
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,151
We think it's going to work this is just amazing what a beautiful idea

126
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
This beautiful idea

127
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
With the new process to make a rare sugar called

128
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Tagatose

129
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,599
Tagatose is a sugar with like magical properties

130
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,951
It is very low calorie it tastes like actual sugar which

131
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Is miraculous enough

132
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,815
But also you eat it and it stops your blood sugar from rising

133
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,887
Also according to a scientist that we talked to

134
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
If you eat it in large quantities

135
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
It could give you the runs

136
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
But still

137
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Has potential

138
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,103
Yes it's one of the sugars found in nature and things like apples and cacao trees

139
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
But Justin very tiny amount

140
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,967
Do you know if you want to talk about who invented tagatose Godin

141
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,575
God may have invented it but scientists have been making it in labs for years

142
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
The dream

143
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Had always been

144
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
To put tagatose

145
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
And soda

146
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
Cereal and

147
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Candy

148
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
Imagine being able to eat

149
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,535
All the crap you want

150
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
And not worry about all the bad stuff that

151
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
Do you like weight gain

152
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Diabetes

153
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:35,007
Now the reason this hasn't happened is that tagatose is really expensive to make

154
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,079
This new process was a way to make it on the cheap and in huge amount

155
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,127
I knew the technology was

156
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Could be

157
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,455
Earth-shattering I mean just globally

158
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Globally significant

159
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,319
Financial perspective but also globally significant from the public health first

160
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
From a financial perspective

161
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
Sugar is about 100 billion dollar-a-year Market

162
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
This company could be on the verge of making a lot of

163
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,607
And I was as job he was hired to Market what was being invented

164
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
In Matlab

165
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,007
The scientist said was working for was a guy named Percival Zhang he was also a professor at Virginia Tech

166
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
And I told me that you really admired person

167
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Well

168
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
She's very smart

169
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
This is a bit of a language barrier

170
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Because

171
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
He's originally from China

172
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,759
It says they emailed a lot seem to have a good relationship

173
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
Everything is chugging along

174
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
And then it says he notices

175
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,671
I started hearing some discussion of

176
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Travel

177
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
To China and other places

178
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Bye

179
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Are the professor and other

180
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Reason the company

181
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
He didn't really think very much

182
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
Suspicious at first

183
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,447
Because the professor is a Chinese citizen right

184
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
Only the Chinese cities

185
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
Naturalized US citizen

186
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
I think he probably still has family over there

187
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Buddy at

188
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Speaking engagements

189
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:48,735
Didn't seem to be anything unusual about that personal also seem to have a relationship with a lab and Chow

190
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
I started hearing about a satellite lab

191
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,855
That there's another lab being set up somewhere in

192
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,927
China by the way principles lawyer denies that there were satellite

193
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:01,023
Did you ever just pull the professor into an office and say

194
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Hey

195
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Pal

196
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:07,423
It's making me uncomfortable that I'm hearing about a satellite lab setup in China

197
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
Did you ever just confront him and say

198
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
What are you doing

199
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,567
Well not exactly like that

200
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
I wanted to be

201
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
Respectful of

202
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
The professor because

203
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Very smart guy

204
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
He started the company

205
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
It was his company

206
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
You know what I

207
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
I didn't want to try to order him around but also

208
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
Atone stock in person

209
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
So whatever happens to the company

210
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Also happens to

211
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,303
So it says he's just kind of leery

212
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,911
And then in December of 2015 six months after the discovery in the lab

213
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
Principal is out of the office he's travel

214
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
NSS

215
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
If you get another email from Percival that worries him

216
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
It's about their amazing breakthrough

217
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
The tag

218
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:54,015
Ed told me that in this email Percival mentions a research institute in China

219
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:58,111
It's called the Tianjin Institute of industrial biotechnology

220
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
What is the

221
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:03,487
Tianjin Institute of biotechnology the Chinese Academy of Sciences

222
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
As I understand it so is owned by the government

223
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,119
And the professor tells you hey we've got an opportunity

224
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
To sell our technology

225
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
To them

226
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
Yes I the number was

227
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
Between 5 and 20 million dollars

228
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
To sell 60% of the technology

229
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,615
And I was like

230
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
Anadel canale we got a real problem

231
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967
That is a diversion Percival denies it

232
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,575
It said she was like I don't know anything about this institute in China why would we agree to do this

233
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
Yeah if the technology was successful

234
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,671
You can get it in major soda brands

235
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
It could be an candy bar

236
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,279
Actually try to Spoonful it was so good the runs

237
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
I was thinking like

238
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Little packets of tagatose for your coffee

239
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,751
All together this seems like it could be worth a lot more than 20 million dollar

240
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
3 days after that email the company holds a board meeting

241
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
The way I remembered it

242
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,687
He and Percival said across from each other at a long conference

243
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,759
It wasn't very long meeting and it was not a very friendly meeting

244
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
And it involves some shouting

245
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,367
Like what are you doing here

246
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
And why is this happening

247
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
This is not appropriate

248
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,023
And that's what I was told that my contract would not be extended past December 5th

249
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
Edison fire

250
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,143
It says he tried asking Percival

251
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,935
What was going on in China

252
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
Was Percival taking their technology

253
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
He's there but he says he wasn't getting clear answers

254
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
No it does know that

255
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
The company is getting it

256
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,711
Funding from Grants to work on tagatose in these other Technologies

257
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
Some of those grants are from the National Science Foundation

258
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,855
So he sits down and he does something that

259
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
I don't know

260
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,231
He starts reading through Grant applications looking into whether there's been Grant

261
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,047
And I realize okay well the grant applications

262
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,375
Save that the company owns these Technologies

263
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703
But the professor is sang the

264
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
Meet the company does not own these techno

265
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
And that is a contradiction

266
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
And if

267
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
What the professor is saying is true

268
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Then that makes

269
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
The statements in the grand application

270
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Untrue

271
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:08,159
Oh that is not a small deal I'm not going to say the professor's been lying

272
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951
But I will say

273
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
That

274
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
There was a

275
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
Apri big contradiction

276
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,583
You're not supposed to contradict yourself

277
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Anna Grant Apple

278
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,215
Ed Banks out an email to the National Science Foundation

279
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Apartment apartment

280
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
So

281
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
On page 3 says

282
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
I'm not a science

283
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
However in my understanding of the grain application

284
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,039
Proposed telling on the man who hired him a guy he says he admired

285
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
Respected professor

286
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
So there's a

287
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,415
Thing I've seen in my son's school that says

288
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Choose the

289
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,743
The hard right not the easy wrong

290
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
This was I wouldn't say this

291
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,887
Easy decision to let the NSF no

292
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,447
It was a decision that I felt like I had to make

293
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,311
Within a few weeks the National Science Foundation froze the company's grant money walletinvestor

294
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,895
But interestingly despite all of this

295
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
Ed and Percival

296
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Did not immediately cut

297
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
Which seems weird because

298
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
There's a lot of mistrust

299
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
But remember each other two

300
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
They both own shares in percival's compass

301
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,231
And Ed has also started another come

302
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
He called bonomo's

303
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,559
The two men negotiate a deal

304
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
Ed give shares in his company

305
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Percival's company

306
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,751
And the tagatose technology is transferred over to Ed's new

307
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Then

308
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,639
About nine months later at got good news from the US patent

309
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
And trademark office

310
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
Basically saying you guys got something unique here

311
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,063
And it's been out talking to food and beverage companies about this stuff and some of them were showing Brilinta

312
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,927
And then last April one of those companies send Zed an email

313
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
Deer head

314
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,767
I've attached to this email a patent from China

315
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
That is pretty similar to yours

316
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Did you have

317
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
Chance to see this pattern

318
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
?

319
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Best regards

320
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
That's a

321
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
What

322
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
To be clear

323
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
It is a patent Apple

324
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Application

325
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
And it's in Chinese

326
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
And so we ran it through Google Translate

327
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,759
But you really ran it through Google translate instead of

328
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
Getting a translator hearing

329
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
Charter Fitness

330
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
Google translate free

331
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
And up comes a name

332
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,463
The Tianjin Institute of industrial

333
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,559
Technology the Chinese Research Institute that Ed says Percival had emailed

334
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,327
I'm about

335
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
Now was applying for a patent

336
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
The Maytag

337
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
Yes and according to court documents that Ed has filed that application is nearly identical to

338
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
To the process that ends company-owned

339
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
The patent has for inventors listed

340
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
But two of them are anonymous

341
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,831
And this is what sets said on his path

342
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
He wonders

343
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,671
He's one of those Anonymous inventors

344
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:55,071
Percival Zhang that was the spring of 2007

345
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:00,447
A couple months later President Trump orders this investigation into China's alleged

346
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,799
Theft of us IP and technology and that is when Ed Rogers

347
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Decided to stick his head up

348
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,687
Write to the Trump Administration and get himself involved in this big trade War

I wish I can meet Percival Zhang

361
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
But it is not an option

362
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,975
I can tell you what he looks like because there a pictures online

363
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
He looks so much like a scientist

364
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,351
That he is practically a stock photo sign

365
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655

In this one picture weirdly he's wearing a pink button-down shirt and he's holding up a loaf of bread toward the camera

370
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,759
So I clicked on that one and it's a new story about Percival trying to turn

371
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Plant waste

372
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Into food

373
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,903
I really wish I could meet Percival but his lawyer told me that's not a notch

374
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,303
So I talked to the lawyer and what you're going to hear is what Percival is alleging in a counterclaim against

375
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,191
Instead my name is James hoppenfeld and I am an intellectual property lawyer

376
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Can you

377
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
Tell me a little bit about your client what kind of guy is he

378
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
Yai

379
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,359
Professor John is

380
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
A professor

381
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
And he Specializes

382
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
In

383
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:56,159
Industrial chemistry would be one way to put it okay that was a good answer that was a very very answer but I actually Mormon

384
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
What kind of guy is

385
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,023
Percival is a very passionate

386
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
Person and he believes very strongly

387
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
In

388
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
What he does that is he

389
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
He

390
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,959
He really wants to

391
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Create

392
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
And develop

393
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Technical innovations that

394
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Benefit

395
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,871
He's exceptionally intelligent

396
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
And like I said very passion

397
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
But also a guy who knows

398
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
His limit so

399
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,551
That's why he hires at to run the business end

400
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,879
The talk up his inventions to potential investors

401
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,439
And when he does that when he hires Ed

402
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Principles lawyer says

403
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
She now has gotten himself

404
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
Stuck in one of the oldest

405
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
Rivalries in his

406
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
The scientist versus the sales

407
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
The scientist

408
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,727
Will Percival wanted

409
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
He wanted to focus more

410
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,311
Taking the technology and

411
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Just getting it out there

412
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,639
And spreading it if they have the big money on the way

413
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Awesome

414
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
But the salesman

415
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
He

416
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
Really was focusing solely on making money

417
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
The lawyer says that within a few months

418
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
Percival realized

419
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
This was just a

420
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
Unfixable dining

421
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,511
And on top of that he didn't think Ed was doing a particularly good job

422
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
Sun December 2015

423
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
He fired at

424
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
And the lawyer says

425
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
Ed came after him

426
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
First kind of gently

427
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Listen first of all I think

428
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,823
I know a lot more about how to commercialize all of these inventions

429
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
Can you do you're an academic

430
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
I'm I'm the money guy

431
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,967
Why don't we form this new company

432
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
And you assign the rights

433
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551
Cities Grant and all these all this stuff to me

434
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
You go do your research

435
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
I'll focus on me

436
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,975
But by this point James lawyer says that Percival just didn't trust Ed

437
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
He said no

438
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
Then he started to get very aggressive

439
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,631
And the first thing he did as he started to hinto Elison purse

440
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,959
I see some improprieties annies Grant Apple

441
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Locations that you

442
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
And he started threatening

443
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
To report

444
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
Percival for

445
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Grant fraud

446
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
To the authorities

447
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,015
Why did principal not just get out of bed with this man why did he not just say look we are

448
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
Done I want you out of my life

449
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,367
Why continue this

450
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
Obviously

451
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
Toxic relationship

452
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,231
Ed Rogers had implied

453
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
The Percival

454
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
That if he

455
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
Did this deal with

456
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,631
That he would help Percival

457
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
We are his rep

458
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Mutation

459
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
Now you have to understand how Percival

460
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,519
You understand how personal was feeling at this

461
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
He's been accused of Grant fraud

462
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
He knows he's a Chinese National

463
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
Here is Ed Rogers

464
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
Who's the All-American boy who's accusing him

465
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,551
Of committing this route so he scared he scared that people aren't going to believe

466
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,391
So the lawyer says this is why Percival agreed to that deal with Ed

467
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,695
His back was against the wall and so

468
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
He signed over the tag

469
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
Reddit fat is a

470
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
That is a

471
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
Very

472
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
That's like

473
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
Mustache twirling

474
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
Stuff

475
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
That you've deleted

476
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,335
For lack of a better word because it's really accurate I don't let you know I don't want to

477
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Exaggerated word

478
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,943
But in this case it's not exaggerated to say diabolical

479
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Let me think about it

480
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,295
In April 2016

481
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
Ed Rogers finds himself what with what he

482
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
He thinks it's some of Percival Jong

483
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
Most valuable technology

484
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
A year before

485
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,791
And Rogers didn't even probably didn't even know what tagatose was

486
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,655
Percival John works on this technology for years and years and years and years he has a stellar

487
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
Professional reputation is everything

488
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,751
He's on his way to commercializing a technology

489
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,799
In the space of a few months

490
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
Ed Rogers has

491
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,431
A large chunk of his intellectual property and is completely damaged

492
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Reputation

493
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
That's like a coup d'etat

494
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,807
Not to be clear we have no idea whose

495
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
No we don't

496
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,647
Ed Rogers says this is all nonsense

497
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,207
He says he didn't threaten Percival

498
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,559
He never offered to help clear percival's name he didn't steal percival's company

499
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,631
It's company sued perceval in May of 2017

500
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
Claiming among other things

501
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Breach of

502
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,543
The suit essentially says principal stole the technology in the trade secrets

503
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
And took them to China

504
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
And from that point on it got very

505
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,223
In November of 2017 Percival was arrested and charged

506
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
With Grant fraud

507
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,063
He spent three months in jail he denies the charges

508
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,111
Anime of this year percevault

509
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,207
Counter Sue dead in Ed's company for breach of contract defamation

510
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Another clue

511
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
So he will have two trials over the next time

512
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
A civil case with Ed

513
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,887
In a criminal case with the USA

514
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,519
We did get in touch with the Tianjin Institute of industrial biotechnology in China

515
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,871
They told us this tagatose patent application is theirs

516
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,175
And that they developed it independently

517
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
So this is what a trade War looks like between two guys

518
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,831
In Virginia but these two guys are not the reason we're maybe not

519
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
Trade war with China

520
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
No they're really not

521
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,487
This us trade Representatives report was about so much more

522
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,143
It's about accusations that China is forcing American companies that want to do business there to turn over their technology

523
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,447
And of course companies do want to do business

524
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
China it is a

525
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
Huge Market hundreds of millions of

526
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,103
Tow companies go there and they turn some stuff over

527
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,407
And of course I don't want to talk about the compromise

528
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Texas State majors

529
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,991
And many of them probably fear retaliation from China

530
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
It's company isn't really in that

531
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,599
It's a small company and they're not working

532
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,440
But I'm lonely I think they are representative of what's going on

533
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,024
At the heart of this fight between Percival and Ed is a

534
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,560
Ton of mistress

535
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,352
Over what the other guy was up to

536
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,400
And there's also a ton of Fury

537
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,472
And whenever the US trade report I came away thinking

538
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
We are afraid of China

539
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:35,616
We are afraid that they are trying to surpass Us in part by stealing our stuff

540
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,712
President Trump seems to think a trade War may change that

541
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,272
But it could be a really expensive

542
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,024
If you are somehow involved

543
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,376
In a trade war or a price war or war war let us know

544
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:03,008
