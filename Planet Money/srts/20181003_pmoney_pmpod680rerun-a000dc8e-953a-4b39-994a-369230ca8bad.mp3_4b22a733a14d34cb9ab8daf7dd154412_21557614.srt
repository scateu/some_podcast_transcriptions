1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,280
Hey just a quick note

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:04,864
This episode originally ran in January 2016

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,424
It's reported by David kestenbaum and Audrey Quinn

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:10,240
For as long as I can remember I've seen these ads

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,800
I think the first one I saw was just on a telephone

6
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,848
Is a piece of paper stacked up

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Say something like

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,176
You can work from home and get rich

9
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
Call this number

10
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,784
Is I remember there was a picture of a person wearing pajamas and there was a

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:27,392
Decide so now all over the Internet or even videos

12
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
This is one of my favorite

13
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,976
There's this woman waking up in this big

14
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:35,328
Plushbeds she's covered in what looks like a bear skin rug

15
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,120
Harder

16
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
What is Italy

17
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
New

18
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960
She sits up crabs

19
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
The cat

20
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,008
Expanding its belly

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,032
So

22
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,080
You want to work from home huh

23
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,872
Nobody

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,944
No schedule making money from

25
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,992
Does not sound right

26
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,808
It does sound great and also Improv

27
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,624
Because of course this is a scam

28
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,928
But it is a very effective one

29
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,512
It's been around for decades and it will not die

30
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:10,912

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
Despite what those work-from-home ads suggest

45
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,784
They are not offering you a job they're not trying to hire you

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
The companies behind those that are trying to sell you stuff

47
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,440
So that in theory you can get rich work

48
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Here's how it works

49
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,024
When you respond to One of Those ads

50
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,328
You give them your name and your contact info

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
Then you get a call from someone at a call center

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Saying so

53
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
Do you want to work from home

54
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
I would have been on the phone

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
That would have been

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
The first call you would have received

57
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,128
This is Ryan Jensen in 2007 he just graduated

58
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
College in St George Utah

59
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
I was looking for a job

60
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,016
A friend of his suggested he come to work with him at this call center

61
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
Call center Industries vegan

62
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,392
His friend takes him to this nondescript Office Park at the edge of town

63
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
When you first walk in

64
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,720
There's a secretary sitting there

65
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
They just had a couch out front

66
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,840
Let me know the picture maybe a plan out and then they just bleed your own back into the

67
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,192
Call Flora there about three guys back there on the call floor they actually called it

68
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
The bullpen

69
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,752
Aaron sit in cubicles with headset

70
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,824
Ryan's call center offered all types of

71
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Images

72
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
Most of them would help you sell stuff online you want to set up a website they can build it for you so coach you on how to run a web

73
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,552
Business handle all the paperwork the accounting

74
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,624
Ryan said the pitch was this is the Internet it's huge

75
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
You can sell to the whole world

76
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,976
I didn't really understand the online world too much back then

77
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,792
I mean I was the guy that played football and hated computers

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,632
You know back then you think

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,496
Yeah they're going to Great coaching company they're going to get a website and they're going to learn how to sell online so great

80
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
There were some red flags

81
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
Sometimes you get to the office in fine white powder on his desk

82
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,432
Turned out to be residue from people snorting oxy

83
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
B cotton

84
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Ryan's job with the

85
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Call people

86
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
It responded to one of those work

87
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
And try to convince them that he had a very special offer

88
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
Try to make the sale

89
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:45,024
We actually have recordings of these calls not in the place where Ryan works but from a different company

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
The tax Club

91
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,144
We got the recordings from the Federal Trade Commission which has been trying to shut these places down

92
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
This one set of calls to that wasn't

93
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Hello

94
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,640
You Don't Know This Woman's name is bleeped out that I like to think of her as Doris

95
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
Man calling says his name is Blake Cantor

96
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Sanford Clinic

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
How are you this morning

98
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
I want to know right now

99
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,088
Cleaning up my grandson's bedroom

100
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
Oh yeah

101
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
Never ends right

102
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
So you sick

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
Steven

104
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
He spoiled

105
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Spoiled

106
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:24,447
Aren't they all most of them anyway but that's okay grandmothers are supposed to spoil their grandson

107
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,287
We played this calls for Ryan the guy who worked in some of the

108
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
And he walked us through the whole

109
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
The sales people he says

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
They're all working off of

111
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Script

112
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,991
Script is a few pages long and it lays an egg

113
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
Exactly how

114
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,343
Make the sale he says the scripts are basically works

115
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,951
Start their Homeland over years past All Around Utah they laid out the most

116
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
Time-tested most

117
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,839
Efficient way to get someone to eventually give you their credit card number

118
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
That's what they want your credit

119
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,703
In an expiration date in a CCV

120
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
That's the girl that's the

121
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
That's the bell ringer

122
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:05,151
We got our hands on one of these scripts and basically breaks the wholesale down into these differ

123
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Parts

124
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
The first part is just called the intro

125
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
The idea is to establish rapport

126
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Ryan says everybody had their own ways

127
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
Would say for example

128
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,159
Does your wife know about this business

129
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Is she going to be involved

130
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,559
They said yes then say okay is she available get on the phone as well now if not

131
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Let's reschedule this

132
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
Because obviously

133
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
I'm not a very good marriage counselor

134
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
And I don't want to get you in trouble

135
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
They got a chuckle out of that line

136
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
Oh they always

137
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Love that way

138
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,919
Imma call with Blake and Doris you can tell that Blake is using a screw

139
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,991
Because there's this one moment where she messes up

140
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,575
When the dorses answers comes unexpected and he kind of trips up

141
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
Have you ever set up an e-commerce business

142
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Just before

143
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231
I did years ago

144
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,327
Alright listen don't worry most about I mean business successful

145
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Pay attention Blake

146
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Real person

147
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
After this he just plows ahead

148
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
It goes on to the next part of the screw

149
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Which is called

150
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
The blast

151
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,567
Script for this part says

152
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,359
Ask find out question

153
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,687
Fleek means to figure out what Doris wants to do

154
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,735
So we can figure out what to push on her

155
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,039
You don't touch the products you're going to be selling it

156
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
I haven't done anything yet

157
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,999
Alright my laptop doesn't seem to do what I wanted to do right right

158
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:29,631
It's it always works that way we'll listen I'm going to let you know I'm going to guide you and getting your back

159
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
End of your business shut up

160
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
So that

161
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
You can

162
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,079
So that you can make as much money as possible as quickly as possible

163
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
Save as much money as possible

164
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,687
Taxwise okay that's good

165
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,295
Doris doesn't have a working computer or any idea what she wants to sell

166
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,575
Some people sold

167
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,415
Weight loss shakes or herbal supplements or skin cream that kind of stuff

168
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,767
She has no idea but Blake moves rate on to the next part of the script

169
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
It's called the probe

170
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,607
The probe is this critical delicate part

171
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
Is whole pet

172
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
Blake needs to figure out

173
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
How much money should I

174
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
So we can figure out

175
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
How much you can get

176
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
Needs to probe for finance

177
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:14,175
Which seems like a hard thing to just turn a conversation to so how much money do you have

178
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
The Blake signs away in

179
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
This is just three minutes into the call

180
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,087
Don't you aware of this but one out of three internet businesses are sued

181
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Every year

182
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
For one violation

183
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,791
Now I just want to get an idea of what type of assets you have that we will be

184
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
Texting with this Corporation are you a homeowner

185
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Yep

186
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Okay

187
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
Get a mortgage on the ceiling

188
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
Do you own any vehicles

189
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
Sorry about Sam

190
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
A van

191
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
Teddy is Italy store

192
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
Picture that one

193
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Okay on that

194
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,319
Ryan the guy who used to work in these call centers he says this part of the script made him feel super nervous

195
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
Yeah for him this was all just very off

196
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,231
Remember he was 20 something years old and he thought like who am I

197
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Ub advising

198
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
What do I know about me

199
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
I'm broke

200
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,375
But some of the salesman Aries has had no problem

201
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,215
With some guys who like could almost always close a deal

202
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,799
Yeah like give me 10-15 minutes to get a smoke break I'll come back and

203
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,407
Hammerless down so they just call after call after call just what they do for a living

204
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Android

205
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
How they do that

206
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,807
What makes some good as no fear they don't they're not afraid to talk about money

207
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,367
Because if you're afraid to talk about money on the phone

208
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
They're going to betray you afraid to talk about money if you just act like

209
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,839
$2,000 this is what it is where I guess you're broke where how many credit cards do you have that if

210
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
If you just talk to them normally

211
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
They'll feel more comfortable about

212
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,775
Ryan says the salesman would just be walking around the office their headsets on

213
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,871
They put a few golf balls while they're talking on the call on this call we're listening to

214
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
Blake the salesman does

215
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
Exactly what Ryan says

216
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
The pros do

217
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
He just plays it super

218
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Casual

219
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
And Doris goes along

220
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
She tells him all these specific Finance

221
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Like

222
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,975
She tells him for that mortgage that she owes about $200,000

223
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:09,375
It's really not that I mean I know a lot of people are stupid people everyday and then I mean I know people much much worse position

224
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
You are you have savings

225
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
Oh yeah a little bit little bit

226
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
Stealing another passed away

227
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
She

228
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Get up kids some

229
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
So I put it away

230
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
Just a ballpark if you had to say

231
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,039
I don't want an exact number it's none of my business and

232
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,647
Non surgery right around 50000

233
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
We have working capital in the checking account

234
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
Ballpark what would you say that is

235
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Mm

236
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,423
You can almost hear Blake doing the Matthew

237
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
Counting up how much money he can go after

238
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
At this point blank moves on to the next part of

239
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
And the script that we have

240
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
What it says is

241
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Find the path

242
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Find the fear

243
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,247
It is adamant about this find more pain if needed

244
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,063
Everybody has pain it is your job to find

245
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
It's like this demented

246
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,903
Twist on the classic salesman

247
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,487
Convince the person that you have the solution to their problems

248
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
Soap Lake manufacturers

249
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
The pain for Doris

250
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,167
This way you don't have to deal with the IRS on your own I don't know if you've ever dealt with them but

251
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
It's like dealing with the Gestapo

252
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Ryan like this

253
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,311
So fancy line that's a fancy one liner

254
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
You think if excuse is that a lot

255
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Absolutely

256
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
Absolutely does

257
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,271
How many hours a week do you think you're going to invest in

258
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
5 to 8 hours a day

259
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
Really that's fantastic

260
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,023
Okay because

261
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,863
Dedicate

262
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
7 figures that is $1000000

263
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:52,287
Darcy talking about working from home like halftime and hoping she's going to make $1000000

264
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,103
I've been thinking about why people fall for this

265
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,199
And when you're someone who's never done super great financially

266
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,527
It can seem kind of like magic how some people just make it

267
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,367
And here's this guy saying I know those Secrets I can tell him to you

268
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
It can be complicated but together we can do it

269
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,255
And 21 minutes and 45 seconds to call

270
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
Lake goes for it

271
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
He goes in for the cell

272
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:21,215
Silicon membership consists of a one-time initial setup fee and only a small corresponding retainer fee

273
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,287
Everything that we've discussed here today

274
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
It's only a one-time investment

275
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,895
$4,785

276
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Okay

277
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
And

278
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,503
$49 and ninety-five a month

279
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
Which I will wave for the first

280
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
49 what

281
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
4995

282
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
Who is credit Blake is upfront

283
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:55,263
Now he says we are talking about you paying $4,785 upfront

284
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
+ 4995

285
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
He says you can write it off

286
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
He tries to get her to pay out of a checking account

287
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,271
I have everything in the system here setup it would be very helpful to me

288
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
If

289
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Squeaking

290
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,951
Start the the billing process

291
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Okay what

292
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,559
I just maxed it out okay what can you do

293
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
Is there anything you could do right this moment

294
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,911
No not right now okay

295
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
Fine I'll just save everything here

296
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
Sorry to do that to you

297
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
She apologizes

298
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
To a guy who's trying to take her money

299
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Fat tiger

300
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
Lake makes one more at

301
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
He says

302
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Just give me your debit card info

303
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
Cremation now you can put the money in it tomorrow

304
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,159
All right you'll be using your debit card was that correct

305
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
Is that a fuse for a MasterCard

306
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Thesis

307
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
Visa

308
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
All right what are those numbers

309
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
Your fast she tells him

310
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,823
And here's this moment where I'm like maybe she's caught on maybe there's something deep in her gut is saying no

311
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
This is not right

312
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
I was totally rooting for her

313
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
But then this happened

314
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
I got it

315
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
Okay the number

316
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
Is

317
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,487
Expiration okay in the three-digit CVV number on the back

318
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
Ryan the guy who worked in the call center

319
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,375
Told us that if you are the sales person you get to this point

320
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
You are site

321
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,959
He's doing a dance in his chair right there

322
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
He got 16 digits

323
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
CCV and an expiration date

324
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
From a woman he never met

325
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,455
All he done with spend 35 minutes with her on the phone

326
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,271
And she did transfer the money into account that she promised

327
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,575
She paid the 4700

328
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
$85 membership

329
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
The salesman Blake he would have made 10 to 20% of that that's as much as $1,000 for one call

330
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,839
Ryan told he made less from the stuff that he was selling

331
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
He was right out of college easy money

332
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,959
What was the story that you told yourself to make

333
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
Yourself feel okay about

334
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,799
Trying to make living like everyone else

335
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
But like

336
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
Just reading through the

337
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
The script we have here and I don't know how this Ramirez was

338
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
It feels awfully manipulate

339
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
You know

340
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,623
Thousands of dollars for people who do not have it

341
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,463
And if you just think about it for a second the idea that they're going to be able to set up a website

342
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
And make like $100,000

343
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
Pierre excelling

344
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
Whatever it's just you

345
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,679
You know like did you write that way did you feel that way at the time

346
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,495
You know I was a little bit young a little bit naive

347
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
I mean I'd have to

348
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:41,663
Completely say I mean I wasn't completely completely oblivious to it I mean you question the times a little bit

349
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
You do feel a little

350
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
You know aggressive

351
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
Eventually that that feeling wears off

352
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,391
I mean it's a sale at the end of the day is what you end up thinking

353
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
Cell-to-cell is a Sal

354
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,023
And once you make a sale that is not the end

355
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,095
Because once someone has shown their willing to buy something

356
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,655
You can probably get them to buy more

357

After Doris had that call with Blake from the tax Club she gets what is supposed to be her first support call to help her

364
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Get started

365
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
It's a different salesman list

366
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,727
And this new salesman he pushes her further

367
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:42,079
And this gets us to some of the craftiest few lines in this whole set of calls

368
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,151
We have you done anything in regards to getting a loan for the business

369
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,991
No because I don't really want to go into more dip

370
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,879
When are sign is born today what I would rather she do is take the money reinvested

371
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,487
It's kind of like paid off with the loan just of the business would actually claim those liabilities

372
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,071
Should be like paying yourself back with a business loan that make sense

373
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,655
Do you really not borrowing anymore money

374
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,215
You just kind of pain what you've already invested

375
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Is Amazon better

376
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
But it's got to be paid back to

377
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,407
I can't hear you what you say I said it would still have to be paid back

378
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,223
What's the same exact situation you're in now isn't it

379
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
Pic of the difference

380
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
What's the

381
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,183
You know there's this moment in there where she has correctly identify the flaw in his logic

382
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,279
And your like go Doris does this math mind trick

383
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
Steamroll over

384
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,655
Despite his horrible it's like listening to someone get beat up

385
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
She does eventually take out a loan

386
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
Which is more money they can go after

387
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,591
And at the end of this call he gets another 16 digits from her

388
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
They charged her $4,000

389
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,967
And this is not the last call endorses file

390
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,575
Ryan Jensen are guide for all this says that he eventually started running his own call center

391
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,135
Ethology was trying to run a legitimate

392
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,207
Best actually give people shot at setting up a website

393
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Of the South.

394
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,351
But a lot of that coaching and services he was selling they were provided by

395
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Other companies

396
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,935
And at some point it started becoming pretty clear that

397
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Does products

398
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
We're Not Afraid

399
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:20,127
His customers were being passed from company to company just getting sold more and more stuff

400
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Call with a customer in

401
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
In particular

402
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
That kind of changed things

403
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
So I saw this guy you know

404
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,319
45 Grand and coaching to building a website

405
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,623
And do do whatnot and coaching

406
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Well

407
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
After that

408
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
He goes to the tax club and spends another

409
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
Spell $16,000

410
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
So

411
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:46,751
This guy calls us back because we were his main point of contact and he calls us back and he's like I just spent all

412
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
All this money on a business that's not bringing any income and he's crying and I mean he spent $24,000 on speaker cry

413
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Yuan to us

414
00:17:54,687 --> 00:18:00,319
You know I mean when you have somebody that's calling you back broke $24,000 later with nothing to show for it

415
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
I mean

416
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
It hit some chords

417
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
I mean it it's some chords

418
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,999
If you wondering how these call centers can just keep operating

419
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:12,607
It's worth pointing out that they have pretty strong political connections Ryan's call center

420
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
It was based in Utah

421
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,727
And a lot of these call centers are in Utah where there has not been much of cracked

422
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,335
The call centers there have made some pretty major campaign contributions

423
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:27,711
Two recent Attorneys General have been charged with bribery in connection with the call centers

424
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,807
The lawyers at the Federal Trade Commission say trying to go after this cup

425
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Is is a bit like

426
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Playing whack-a-mole

427
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,415
Once enough customers complain

428
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,975
That company just shuts down and opens up under a new

429
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:44,863
The tax Club the company you've been hearing from almost calls with Doris they did actually get shut down

430
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
Reprocessing deceptive sales tax

431
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
That's why we have according to the

432
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:55,615
According to Legal filings the tax Club took in over 220 million dollars from people

433
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,919
There's just one more phone call endorses file

434
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
And it's a wrap

435
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,503
It is from someone calling on her behalf

436
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,575
To a financing company that the tax Club headset dorsai

437
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159

00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951

Snips and coming out of her account, and it started all in August

464
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
It's going to something

465
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,535
Tax Club Global

466
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Something or another

467
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,167
A lot of those building

468
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215

And so why those Services help them

470
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,335
Either run their business or help empty the taxes

471
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:36,479
This is a woman who had dementia 75 years old and could barely turn on his computer

472
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,831
The man on the phone agrees to refund the money to Doris's estate

473
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
We do not know if she got

474
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,183
Taking back the FTC is still so they to the mast

475
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,023
Something like 20000 people said they've been ripped off by the tax Club

476
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
That's enough for you

477
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
Ryan Jensen the call center guy we talked to he was eventually find $400,000 by the state of Utah

478
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
So far he's paid about $5,000

479
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,359
Brian said he's trying to speak out about all the corruption in the Carlson

480
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431
We asked him if he felt bad about his role in it

481
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Here's what he said

482
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503

00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,575

They said they couldn't for privacy reasons I would try to reach the salesman at least by the names they gave him those recordings
