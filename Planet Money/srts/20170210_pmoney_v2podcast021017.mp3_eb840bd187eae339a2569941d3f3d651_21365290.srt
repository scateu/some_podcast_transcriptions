1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,792
At first

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:05,632
Charlie's friends life was like a dream for young entrepreneur

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,936
By the time he was 22 years old

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:11,520
The company had started in his parents basement in Brooklyn and hit the big time

5
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,056
He had dozens of new in

6
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,616
Employees company got a real office in Manhattan

7
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,176
Cool high-tech name bitinstant

8
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,736
Somebody even wrote them a jingle to use in their ads

9
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,784
Do you remember the bitinstant theme song

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,624
If you have course I can sing it word for word

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648
Would you

00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928

15

It's your money why wait

16
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,144
Get Bitcoin the fastest way in is like

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
Optonline

18
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
The place my order quake

19
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,032
Are all those all those words

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,360
As you might have guessed from the lyrics bitinstant mission was

21
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
To help people buy Bitcoin

22
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,688
This is back in 2012

23
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
Digital currency like Bitcoin

24
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
We're just starting to get hot did you buy Bitcoin you would have to arrange with somebody somewhere

25
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,928
Who knew somebody who was willing to sell you some

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,512
Or you have to wire money to a big Exchange in Japan

27
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,816
And wonder if you actually get the Bitcoin

28
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,632
Bitinstant made it as easy as getting a money

29
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
You can walk into a Walmart

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Or pharmacy tech Duane Reade

31
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,544
Give them cash and walk out with Bitcoins in your digital wallet

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,592
Theevandi Bitcoin transactions online

33
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,896
Charlie says there was a lot of demand

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456
We are processing

35
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
Over $9 a day

36
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,368
One of the things that people like about digital currency like Bitcoin

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,440
Was it unlike Bank transfers or personal checks

38
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,744
Bitcoin that you buy things anonymously

39
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,072
Which was really attractive to a certain kind of person

40
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Drug dealers

41
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
Also drug buyers truck buyers to

42
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,008
There was a website called Silk Road where people could buy and sell

43
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Marijuana

44
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
Cocaine

45
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Ketamine

46
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,688
Horse tranquilizers Hitmen one time Hitman okay one hit

47
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
All those people using Silk Road

48
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,552
They drove up the demand for Bitcoin

49
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
Which Charlie says

50
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
Makes sense when you think about it

51
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,464
It's always going to be the people that need to use something the most hurt me the first ones to use it

52
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
One of the people who needed to use Bitcoin

53
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,072
Was a man who went by the screen name

54
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
BTC King

55
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
Bitcoin cash

56
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,752
On Silk Road BTC King served as a money changer for all the drug buyers and sellers

57
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,800
Who wanted to trade dollars for Bitcoin

58
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,384
And BTC King he got Bitcoins from Charlie shrem Company

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Bitinstant

60
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,712
It seems to me that you knew

61
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
Roughly what this guy was up to

62
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
And

63
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
And yet

64
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
We were sort of like

65
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
Let's go ahead and do that

66
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,720
Curious like what you're thinking was

67
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
In terms of

68
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
Back in that moment

69
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
I wasn't thinking

70
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
That was the whole point

71
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
And for a couple of years not

72
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Thinking

73
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
Worked out just fine for Charlie

74
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
In fact it was really really profitable

75
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,336
Twenty-two-year-old Charlie shrem was a million

76
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896
Is there a moment that you remember

77
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,688
When you were kind of like

78
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,040
Oh no I've gone way too far down this road

79
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Yeah

80
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
Baidu

81
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,416
Now is the moment that replacing the handcuffs on my hands

82
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,264
Glow looking to Planet Money I'm Robert Smith and I'm Keith Romer

83
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,592
Today on the show The Story of Charlie shrem

84
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,664
How does Kid From Brooklyn went from living in his parents basement

85
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,480
Living the life of a Bitcoin millionaire

86
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
Tube

87
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
Well Federal Prison

88
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,368
Charlie shrem Odyssey into prison and back out again

89
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,184
He's a kind of parable for everything that has happened

90
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
With Bitcoin in The Last 5 Years

91
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
Charlie and Bitcoin

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
I've gone from being idealist

93
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
2 Outlaws 2

94
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
Trying to make it as respectable citizen

Understand

104
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,687
How and why Charlie shrem ended up in handcuffs

105
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,783
It helps you get your head around the culture that surrounded a lot of the early enthusiasm

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
You know that guy in high school who

107
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Picks up Ian Rand

108
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,415
For the first time

109
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
The Fountainhead and then

110
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
Cannot stop talking about this new

111
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
World and what it means man

112
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
That was the young Charlie shrem

113
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
Only instead of The Fountainhead

114
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
For Charlie it was

115
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,799
Bitcoin was going to be the key to unlocking the libertarian Utopia of the future

116
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,407
Because think about it Bitcoin is sort of the exact opposite of something like a credit card

117
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
Credit card leave the whole paper trail that can

118
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
Be tracked by Banks or the government

119
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
If they want to get up and do your business

120
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,415
Chinese Bitcoin takes a power back from the banks of the government and gives it to individual

121
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,719
At the end of a like I have a dollar bill I handed

122
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
To you

123
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
There's no one in between the transaction

124
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,375
There's no law that prevents me from handing you a dollar bill

125
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,959
Take one is the same way so that same way that I can hand you a dollar

126
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
And the room can no longer be in the room

127
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
No one can see it now

128
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Hear it

129
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
I can send a dollar to someone in China

130
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
The same exact way

131
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
If everyone used Bitcoin

132
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Charlie evangelized

133
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,063
The time government wouldn't be able to control how and where people spent their money

134
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,415
Big Banks wouldn't be able to get rich charging people for moving their own property

135
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
From one place to another

136
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
Charlie didn't just kind of thing

137
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,143
Remember he was 22 and he was one of those twenty-two-year-old who is so sure he's figured everything out

138
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
I believe that I was

139
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
Completely right about everything all the time

140
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,567
Including you know that it was okay for his company to help

141
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
Drug dealers buy Bitcoin

142
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,663
You know who didn't think it was okay for a company to do that

143
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
The federal government

144
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,807
Charlie was just coming back from a Bitcoin conference in Europe when he was arrested at JFK

145
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,343
I did a perp walk

146
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
Into waiting vans

147
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
And then

148
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
2

149
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
Metropolitan Correctional Center

150
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy

151
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,191
In the end Charlie was convicted of aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitted

152
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
He was sentenced

153
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,031
Did two years in federal prison in Pennsylvania

154
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
You got to prison

155
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,871
And you say goodbye to your family

156
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Strip down naked

157
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,503
The guards take away your clothes they do a full body search cavity search check

158
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
Eye doctor looks you over you get you

159
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
The prison uniform

160
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Your bunk assignment

161
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
You're on your way

162
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
Prison was hard for Charlie at

163
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
You ever have that

164
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
That feeling that you want to cry but you

165
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
You hold yourself back

166
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,631
And you just want to start bawling any other place to cry in the shower

167
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
How long did that feeling last

168
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
3 weeks

169
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
That sounds like a terrible few weeks

170
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
Who was

171
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,639
Charlie is 5 foot 4 he's not a big guy

172
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
And there is in federal prison

173
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
He's scared I mean scared of what's going to happen

174
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
One night

175
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Early in the sentence

176
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
He's reading in the prison dorm

177
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,879
And one of the other inmates comes up there

178
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
In the middle of night

179
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,743
Semi huge guy walked up to me and thought he was going to beat me up

180
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Because I have my light on

181
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
I said hey man you got to turn your light off

182
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,887
If you want to read here borrow my book light

183
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
I was like oh wow exactly like blending his book light

184
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
Because feel like that's a good outcome

185
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
Yeah he was really we ended up here

186
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,895
Weekly even make me Gyros like once a week he was really nice guy

187
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
Gyros like click click Heroes like Greek food

188
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
Nothing I mean like

189
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Cooked on a radiator whatever it still

190
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
What's the time in prison

191
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
I truly didn't just get things for

192
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
Because in prison just like the outside world

193
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
You have

194
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
The pay for most

195
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
But you can't just

196
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:04,095
We change your pocket and pull out a $5 bill right in prison there is no paper money

197
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
For a while that you cigarettes but

198
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
Federal prisons outlawed cigarettes

199
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,751
I'm so now there's a bunch of different ways you can pay for the

200
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,591
The guy who fixes headphones only accepts protein bars

201
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
The guy who cut your hair

202
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
Wants

203
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
Jars of peanut butter

204
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,503
But I would say the overwhelming majority

205
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
How people would accept Mac

206
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
Just because everyone else would accept it

207
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,415
So if the guy if I only had mackerel

208
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Big Mac album

209
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,767
Yes it was like they were like packets of mackerel

210
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
In soybean oil

211
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
Nicholas about a dollar fifty

212
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,887
These Vacuum Pack things of macaroni

213
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
We're basically occurrence

214
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
Prison and remember Charlie

215
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
Has a lot of

216
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,567
Fox about current problems that come up with current

217
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,919
How safe was a packet of mackerel in soybean oil as a currency

218
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
Someone could steal your life savings from underneath your bunk

219
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,599
Or the mackerel itself could go bad those packets of mackerel had a shelf life of eggs

220
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
3 years

221
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
And that happens

222
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
Not so easy to get your hands on more macro

223
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,279
There's a finite amount of money that people can send you from outside

224
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
And now you can spend

225
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
At the prison commissary

226
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,423
And even that there's a finite amount that you can actually

227
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Spend every week

228
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:17,055
Each week one inmate was allowed to buy a maximum of 14 packets of Mac

229
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
But Charlie says at one point

230
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,943
The guard sees this one guy's entire supply of mackerel

231
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:28,831
Just left it out in the common area for anyone to take you know what happens when you give out free money

232
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
Inflation

233
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,439
Physical macro comes with all of these built-in problems

234
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
As a currency

235
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
So

236
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,303
Lying in his bed at night Charlie starts

237
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,887
What if prison mackerel could be more like 50

238
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
Inside of people trading like

239
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,031
I individual mackerels between each other they be able to trade

240
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
Digitize Mac

241
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Charlie puth has

242
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Plenty of time

243
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
The lightest car

244
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,735
Mary sleeps on end and do this thought

245
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
He's in prison

246
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Nothing but time

247
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,159
Okay so obviously there are a lot of problems with setting up a new digital currency in prison

248
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,207
I mean maybe the most obvious one is

249
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
You're in prison they don't have computer

250
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,839
And this is where Charlie has an insight

251
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
What's important about Bitcoin

252
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
What's most revolutionary about Bitcoin

253
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Is not

254
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Bitcoin

255
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Itself

256
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
It's how the Bitcoin system

257
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Track where the money is

258
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,455
Yeah with Bitcoin the computers in the network keep a record of all the transactions if

259
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
People are making

260
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
The system even has its own catchy name they call it

261
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
The blockchain

262
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,879
A list of the latest transactions that the block

263
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
You think that block of transaction

264
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
The block

265
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
Before

266
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Before that

267
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,327
But without computers Charlie has to think of a different way to

268
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
To do the macro block

269
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,959
Chain so thinks you know what if we just had inmates write down all the transaction

270
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
In physical notebooks

271
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
In blockchain lingo these inmates would be

272
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Notes

273
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,479
I want to pay you to mackerel to give me a hair

274
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Yep

275
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
Instead of trading the actual mackerel

276
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
We go to one of these nodes

277
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
One of these people and say hey

278
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,695
I have this money in my account

279
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
Can you transfer it to his account

280
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
That way no physical macro would have to change

281
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
All going to be in Tommy Knuckles notebook

282
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
I'll be back.

283
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:22,239
I made that up by the way to the best of our knowledge Charlie was not in prison with anyone named

284
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
Okay so he solved the first

285
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
Problem how do you record transact

286
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
That's done

287
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,431
But there's a second problem Charlie's Got saw

288
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,759
All the people he wants to use his macro currency with

289
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
The criminal

290
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Every single one that

291
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
That's why they are in prison

292
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Even

293
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
The trust is an issue

294
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Acute issue

295
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,511
Naturally know the other inmates could just go to the warden

296
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
Like third-party and say hey

297
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,375
I'm not sure Tommy Knuckles is always writing down the right thing in his notebook with

298
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,471
Would you mind being in charge of the notebook maybe they don't want the warden to have all day

299
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Or maybe they don't trust the warden to do a good job either

300
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
The question was how do you do it without a trusted third-party

301
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,919
How do you do it without a centralized

302
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
Authority so if you don't want the warden to be in charge

303
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
And you don't want one guy

304
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
Tommy knuckles

305
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Being charged

306
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
What are you doing

307
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
You make it

308
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
So that no one isn't

309
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
Instead of just Tommy knuckles with his notebook

310
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,023
You get lots of different inmates in different parts of the

311
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,119
Prison all with their own notebooks writing down all the digital macro transaction

312
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Happening in their parts

313
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,983
Just kills me at every every hour or so out in the yard

314
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,823
He's inmate note sit down with each other and copy the new transaction

315
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:30,847
Into the Roundup

316
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,407
Today update each other's now you have two notes

317
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
The Hobbit

318
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
Each of these guys meet with other guys

319
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Notebook notebook

320
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Books baguette notebooks

321
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,111
And all of a sudden everyone has the same record of transactions

322
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
It is a distributor

323
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
Ledger

324
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
As they like to say in the Bitcoin world

325
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
Distributed Ledger

326
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Kelly did not

327
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
Please set up the whole digital currency in prison

328
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
Completely against prison rules

329
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
And Charlie had learned his lesson about break

330
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
He was in prison all together for a year-and-a-half

331
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
And in that time

332
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
He did try to keep up with what

333
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
What's going on in the outside world

334
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,431
Blockchain and Bitcoin and all the rest of it

335
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
What prison is not

336
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
A great place to

337
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
Keep track of what are the

338
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
Bitcoin kids are talking about on websites like Reddit

339
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
People with print out like the front page of

340
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
Reddit vim for send it to me

341
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
But you couldn't click on any of the links

342
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
I know that's why I was funny was so stupid

343
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Making print out the front page of Reddit

344
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,607
Email it to me but I couldn't click the links

345
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,935
What Charlie would have learned if you'd been able to click on the

346
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:32,287
Lynx was it thinking about Bitcoin was undergoing this huge change while he was locked

347
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,639
It's in the focus being what Bitcoin could do to revolutionize the world

348
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
Now we will spend it look at what the

349
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Technology underlined

350
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
The blockchain that

351
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Distributed Ledger

352
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Wet vac

353
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Could do

354
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
On its own

355
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:51,487
And the people starting to get interested in blockchain and distributed Ledger stuff we're not just libertarian 22 year olds

356
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
Now you've got like the shouty financial journalist and Fortune Magazine a new report says the blockchain

357
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,775
I told you that underpins the digital currency Bitcoin will become Central to the Global Financial system

358
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,127
I buy it hook line cigarette

359
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
Giant Global Banks

360
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
They wanted a piece of the action to

361
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Welcome

362
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:19,135
And thank you for your interest in Block that we're going to discuss this topic today with two experts from.

363
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Okay the banks were in

364
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
And then as proof that

365
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
Radical underground ideas of Bitcoin

366
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,607
Had become completely mainstream

367
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Play gentlemen

368
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
A TED Talk

369
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
The technology

370
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
Likely to have the greatest impact

371
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
On the next few decades

372
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Has arrived

373
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
And you'll be surprised to learn

374
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,783
But it's the underlying technology of digital currencies like Bitcoin

375
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
It's called the blockchain

376
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Block

377
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Chain

378
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Block

379
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
Chain

380
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,255
So one of the reasons that everybody in the financial in

381
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
Industry is so excited about the

382
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Block

383
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Chain

384
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Is

385
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Leather distressed problem

386
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,215
It's essentially the macro problem all over again except

387
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
Instead of convicted

388
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Criminals

389
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
It's unconvicted Grumman

390
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,359
Unconventional

391
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
Bakers

392
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
For sorry

393
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
Okay okay so

394
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
Francis there are

395
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
Two sides to every

396
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,599
Two Banks One Bank might think I just sold under chairs

397
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
The other one might think

398
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
Wait I thought I just bought a thousand shares

399
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
An honest mistake

400
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,047
That's a lot of mistakes but for whatever reason they disagree

401
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
And this is expensive to sort out

402
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
With a distributed Ledger there's a record

403
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,983
The both of you made together at the time in the first place

404
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
So no disagreement

405
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Thing is

406
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
These days for a lot of transactions it's not just

407
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
2 bags

408
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,919
3 or 5 or 20

409
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
And every time you add an addition

410
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
No thank you add all this complexity

411
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
And all this paperwork

412
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,135
And lawyers and sometimes they're even faxes still in 2017

413
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,951
You put all of that on the distributed Ledger though

414
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
You get rid of the fax machine

415
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,815
You cut way down on the lawyers having to review every little

416
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
Accounting mistake

417
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
It's all automated

418
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Efficient

419
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
It's cheap

420
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
Thanks love the idea

421
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
In July of 2016

422
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,311
Charlie shrem gets out of prison

423
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Into this

424
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
New world

425
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
His girlfriend's waiting for

426
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
I came out in my

427
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
Prison clothes and I had a box

428
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Stuff with meaning

429
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,599
I got rid of my prison clothes that changed in the car and

430
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,927
With left what is that what is that feel like to be on the outside

431
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,535
You ever seen a statue of Atlas with the world on his shoulders

432
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,607
Imagine having that in the magic being lifted Within

433
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,191
You feel a physical weight being lifted off

434
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,775
You it's like it's as if that whole year you were slumping

435
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
And all the sudden you

436
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Stand up straight

437
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
The first thing Charlie does when it's on the outside

438
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
Is to get a cup of coffee

439
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
The second thing is to finally

440
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
Click on those links

441
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
On the Reddit page

442
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,295
Everything is changed

443
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,135
Have you ever went to prison there were no really many blockchain products

444
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
It was only Bitcoin there were a few other like

445
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:06,047
Pledging ones but it was mostly Bitcoin when I got out that year was the year of the blockchain

446
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
That's what a lot of things happen

447
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Twenty-two-year-old Charlie

448
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Would have

449
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Heated the

450
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,751
Back then he called himself a Bitcoin maximalist

451
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,079
Meaning he wanted the entire Financial system to be replaced by big toe

452
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
What was the take power away from the bank

453
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
Not give them one more tool to control us

454
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,271
But older wiser twenty-seven-year-old Charlie

455
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Please find

456
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,111
Well I'm definitely not a Bitcoin maximalist anymore

457
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
I believe that

458
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
And it's not like one chain to rule them all

459
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
Bitcoin does

460
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,583
Something's really amazing but there are other projects I can do something even better

461
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
Charlie's not only okay with all the changes

462
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
He's kind of excited about

463
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
He starts thinking about

464
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,775
What the best way is for him to get back in the game

465
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
Meid comes up with his own clever twist

466
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
On this whole

467
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Can't Stop

468
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,503
He thinks what is blockchain could be used to do an end-run around the way companies go public

469
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
The way stock

470
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
Secreted in trade

471
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
Charlie create a new company

472
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
Intelisys Kappa

473
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,439
Intellisys is going to run an investment

474
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
It will buy up

475
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,767
Privately-owned companies in the US

476
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
Shares in the fund will be sold not to run

477
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Broker on

478
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
Stock Exchange somewhere

479
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
But

480
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Wait for it

481
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
On the blockchain

482
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
Instead of a paper stock certificate

483
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,287
You're going to digital one on the distributed Ledger

484
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
A creative ability

485
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
For people to

486
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,175
Take their own companies public

487
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
For their own assets public

488
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,039
And sell sell shares to those people

489
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Anywhere in the world

490
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
I need to wear as

491
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
Bitcoin relies on the

492
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,439
Collective Agreement that Bitcoin is in fact

493
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Worth something

494
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:41,535
Charlie's new project will be based on real

495
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
Physical

496
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Tangible

497
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
Companies

498
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
Make money to do

499
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,191
In this case a really physical really dance

500
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,775
The first company sanitary way septic tank pumping

501
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
And Porta-Potty cleaning

502
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
You are selling a

503
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
A made-up currency

504
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,967
That's supposed to represent shares

505
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,759
In a business that moves

506
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
Human excrement from place

507
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,623
Yes might like my dad would say Do not invest in

508
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
Your dad

509
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:12,767
You know what be very smart to tell you that never to invest in something that you don't know everything about

510
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
So your dad the smart guy and that is

511
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
My guy

512
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
Charlie is not really

513
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,703
Counting on the Keith rumors of this world and their dads

514
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,727
To invest though

515
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,287
The funniest close to most American investors

516
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,335
In fact to avoid violating us

517
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
Securities Law

518
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,151
He's registered his new company

519
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
In the Cayman Islands

520
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,503
Why are why is it in the Cayman Islands

521
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,807
That's just what the lawyers

522
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Decided

523
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
And that more than anything

524
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,463
It's how you know when a technology has really matured

525
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:49,119
Everyone starts listening to their lawyers
