In California if we did it while we were there

9
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,224
One day I tripped up a hill in Los Angeles

This reporter in LA

12
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:28,928
Senoia where are we we're at the Baldwin Hills Overlook which is

13
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,000
You've likely seen this in a commercial

14
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,072
We're sort of in the middle of the LA basin

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,632
And it gives us this incredible View

16
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,472
So you can look almost 360 and see all away

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,752
Around

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:47,872
The Los Angeles Basin this is what the literary types of call a sweeping Vista I think

19
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
Where it where are the movie lights

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,760
Well one of the movie last words like very nearby that

00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
Culver Studios

00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:01,184
That's what Mel Brooks as office is where they filmed Gone with the Wind

20th Century Fox or 21st Century Fox the movie studio

28
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:15,520
And the other movie studios you can't see cuz they're in the valley and Paramount is somewhere in Hollywood

29
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Okay

30
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080
And we've got you out here because when

31
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
When people think of LA

32
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
They think of some

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
Fairly obvious interest

34
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456

Hollywood

37
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
There's more to it than that

38
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,880
Yeah you think that 18 million people moved here

39
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
Because of Hollywood

40
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:37,280
It's a lot of people with dreams of Stardom Hollywood is very

41
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
Important clearly

42
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,376

One of the largest economies in the country

49
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
Actually also one of the biggest economies in the world

50
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,648
California's economy part of is bigger than France

51
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
To take that

52
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256

First harvest all there

95
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,624
It smells like celery on here

96
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
Yeah I know you don't forget that

97
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,024
It's kind of nice where we are today cuz we're really close to the ocean she get a combination of that

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584
See are in a little bit of celery hands

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
So pretty nice spot to be

100
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:53,216
That pretty nice spot to be is a celery field in Ventura County

101
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
California we were there with Tom.

102
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
His family has owned farms in that area for a

103
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
About 8

104
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
It's like an ocean of celery

105
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,456
Yeah I know there's probably

106
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
80 acres of celery here in

107
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Really

108
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
So that will

109
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
I'll get harvested

110
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
About

111
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Two and a half weeks

112
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,512
In the middle of the ocean of celery

113
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
There is a crew of about

114
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
30 workers

115
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375
They walk in a row in big straw hat

116
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
Hacking up celery

117
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
Restocks and tossing them

118
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
This motorized class

119
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Stretches

120
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
The field and chugs Along by

121
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
They're so fast it's really cool they are it's a skilled physician that takes a lot of years of

122
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,295
Experience to be able to perform at this level and

123
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,343
Obviously you can see they've mastered it

124
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,671
On that moving platform another worker cleans up

125
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
The celery stalk and impacts

126
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
Fit into a box

127
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,583
Alex Martinez is the Harvest manager out here and he shows us his celery

128
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
It's a 12in

129
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
Dexter Stainless Steel machete

130
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
That is then

131
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
Cut about

132
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
4 inches from the top

133
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
Turned in re-welded back to it

134
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
Otis like a custom job

135
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
A lot of crops

136
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
Can be harvested by machine

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Crops like wheat corn potatoes

138
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
The most fruits and vegetables are

139
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
Quite uniform enough

140
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Harvested like

141
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
For the most part they have to be harvested by

142
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
It is really hard and dangerous

143
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
10 hour days

144
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,767
Swinging a knife

145
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
In the hot sun

146
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
And when the job market strong

147
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375
Like it has been for the last few years

148
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
These workers have a lot of other options

149
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,031
They move into whether it's landscaping jobs construction jobs

150
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,335
Food service jobs Whenever there is

151
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
An increase in demand for

152
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
For the general economy

153
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,759
Workers generally migrate away from formwork into other areas

154
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
Tom deardorff

155
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
Just had to compete for work

156
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,391
He's raise their pay by Acts

157
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Quite a lot

158
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
Back in 2006

159
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
Working the celery field paid about $8 and seventy

160
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
An hour

161
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
Now it pays more than $21

162
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Pay

163
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
Has gone up by more than double

164
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Wayfair

165
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
Campground in most of the

166
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,079
Now we are well aware of the criticism that

167
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
That's been around for a while that the app

168
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,735
Agriculture sector relies on underpriced labor and in particular on undocumented workers

169
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
Take very little money for back brake

170
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,855
Can work we couldn't speak to any of the workers on Tom's Farm but

171
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,671
Tom says his workers all are documented and the

172
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Even doubling wage

173
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
Hasn't solved the labor

174
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
Yeah I don't think it's an economically should I think it's a political issue

175
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,655
I mean it is not sustainable under the current political environment that is true

176
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
Because we do not have a legitimate

177
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,567
Immigration policy that allows us access to workers

178
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
Tom says the agriculture visas that the country offers

179
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
Are not real

180
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Sick for his business

181
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
They're too difficult to get their expensive and there's a

182
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Just aren't enough of

183
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
Deirdre Farms used to hire more than

184
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
600 workers

185
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Every year

186
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
But Tom says he can't make that happen anymore

187
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
More so he's had to make changes to his business

188
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
For example

189
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
He's changed

190
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
The crops that

191
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,375
We've shifted away from the most labor-intensive crops

192
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:06,495
So things like Vine ripe Tomatoes we no longer grow anymore you don't grow them at all cuz of Labor

193
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Correct

194
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,103
They're just spit those. Program alone took about 400 workers

195
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:17,503
And so we just got to the point where we could no longer find the steady supply labor and

196
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,575
Decided that we just need to get out of that business

197
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
All together

198
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
Doodle Farms also got out of strawberries

199
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
It's that time has gotten into leafy green

200
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
Things like kale cilantro broccoli

201
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Ancillary

202
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
They require fewer workers and can be at least partly automate

203
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
Where Tom used to hire about

204
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
600 people every year

205
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Now he hires around 2

206
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
But you can find in 200 work

207
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
So I made another

208
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,407
We've also shifted large amount of our production down in the max

209
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
So you shifted

210
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Production

211
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
A big chunk of what you do

212
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,831
Away from the United States and now it's

213
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Being made

214
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
In Mexico

215
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
You couldn't find

216
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Workers

217
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Correct

218
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Yeah I mean basically

219
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
The fact that matter is is it a

220
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
Foreign-born person is

221
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
Harvesting your fruits and vegetables

222
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,775
So the decision is do we want to do that within the United States with a guest-worker program or do we want to have that

223
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
Foreign-born workers stay in

224
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Second Harvest

225
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
Fruit and vegetable sale

226
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:22,015
Based on what we've seen in the political environment over last 15 and 20 years we have decided to go down there and

227
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
How hard was it to make these kinds of

228
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
Decisions based on life

229
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
What you were

230
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,279
I mean if I was looking at spreadsheets all day long as a really simple decision and one we probably should have made five years before we made it

231
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
But I mean these are ranches it

232
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,679
My great-grandfather farmed and we'd rather keep them active but the economics in the politics

233
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Debater suggesting

234
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
So Tom keeps doing what he

235
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
He can to attract workers

236
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,871
Including using that little motorized platform

237
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,175
Cuz it means that the workers don't have to

238
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
Security giant boxes

239
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
Celery across the

240
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
So this machine is like kind of one of the ways that you attract

241
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
The best people

242
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:02,207
Definitely yeah I know you're looking for a competitive advantage in the labor market and this is one way to do that

243
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
To provide a work

244
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
Environment it is

245
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,071
Is safer

246
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,679
It's more efficient and it's slightly easier than what may

247
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
Occur in somebody else's

248
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:19,103
He worried that one year you're just not going to be able to produce whatever it is that you're aiming to

249
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
Mapreduce because

250
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
Enough people just don't show up

251
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
Yeah we try and forecast at a little bit we reduce planting sizes and we spread things out a little bit and

252
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
Just based on what we

253
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
Feel the labor

254
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
Availability is going to be

255
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,255
And then we're constantly looking for Innovation to get us

256
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
The same

257
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
A production with less people

258
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
So we're we kind of attacking on two fronts

259
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
Tom says his business has become this

260
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Constant calculator

261
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
How to harvest more wood

262
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
How to get more crops at

263
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
The ground was

264
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,943
Because in spite of everything the harvesting machines higher pay the different crops

265
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
His turnover rate

266
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Keeps growing

267
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Fewer and fewer

268
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,319
The same workers come back to his farm

269
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Every year

270
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,327
When we were in California there was one very big

271
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Snooze

272
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
State legislators killed a bill

273
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
Called Senate Bill 8

274
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
27 or just s

275
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
To 7

276
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,055
Yes spa27 was meant to address

277
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Housing

278
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
In California

279
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
It's a shortage that has led to

280
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Sky High

281
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
Of course that is not just

282
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,759
California issue it's a problem in California shares with a lot of Pi

283
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,135
Is it talk about California's housing problems and to discuss why bills like SBA

284
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
27 in particular struggle to get past

285
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
We called Pablo monkey

286
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
He's a professor public policy Norman

287
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Planet UCLA

288
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
She said

289
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
You know what

290
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Meet me at the

291
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
This one particular Metro Station

292
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
And I'll show you

293
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,335
This is all about the platform Edge we're sending the Westwood Ranch

294
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,199
Show Park Expo station one of the stations in the city of La new Transit infrastructure

295
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,855
Why did you choose to have us meet you at this Metro station is a good example of what's wrong

296
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:12,255
I was planning in California so we've had this massive public investment in a Metro System surrounded by

297
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,655
Single family homes as far as the eye can see most of them are one-story 1950s stock

298
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,983
Station surrounded by all these 1950s one story houses

299
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Is new

300
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,663
And looks like not that many local residents are using it very skeptical that they do but even if they do

301
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
Did you know maximum 150 people from this neighborhood would be commuting to downtown Los Angeles

302
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
1/4 /

303
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,415
People who drive cars living in flat single family houses

304
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
As far as the eye can see

305
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,767
And you're the strain station there are no visible apartment,

306
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
Papa says that's too bad

307
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,399
Local zoning laws don't allow for certain kinds of buildings

308
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Like apartment complex

309
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Certain areas

310
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
And that limits the overall housing

311
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Supply

312
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
And that means fewer people using public

313
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,615
Transit stops like this train station

314
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,663
And also it means that house prices stay

315
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,063
High and so does the rent if you look at zoning in Los Angeles 75% of residential land

316
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,135
Is zoned exclusively for low-density single-family homes

317
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
Those low-density single-family homes on average are 20% more expensive than houses in in multi-family build

318
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
So I think that

319
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
A logical housing policy would to be to legalize the less expensive kind of housing if in fact we want to make housing more

320
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,799
And Los Angeles can't do that why

321
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,407
Political opposition to change

322
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,711
River that housing Reform Bill SB

323
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
B82 7

324
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
It was defeated

325
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
Literally the day before I met Pavo

326
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
With that Metro

327
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
Literally

328
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,999
Literally not and not like the way the kids use literally or at least figuratively but actually like

329
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:53,887
Right and it still would have literally allowed more construction of apartment buildings close to busy public transit stops

330
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Bus stops

331
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Train stations

332
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,983
Any idea what was the building more apart

333
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
We need more

334
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
And that would mean cheaper rent

335
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
It was kind of amusing to see how many pallets

336
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Lights with the bill was trying to

337
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
To do

338
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
But ended up

339
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
Opposing the bill itself

340
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,343
I do think we have a housing crisis in this state

341
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
But we also have to get it right

342
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,463
Unfortunately be supporting the bill today

343
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:25,119
It pains me a bit to to have to refrain from supporting the measure today

344
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,215
And I will continue to work with your bills doesn't get out of this committee

345
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Today

346
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,799
And hopefully bill is supported at the Seawall

347
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:39,455
The reason spa27 was so controversial is it it would have overruled the zoning laws that were already put in place

348
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
By cities and towns

349
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
California

350
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,575
The laws determining where new construction is allowed

351
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,135
What kind of buildings are allowed Apartments

352
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Prince's houses

353
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,951
How many stories high the build

354
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,535
Can be problem on Canon says there's a few reasons that neighbor

355
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
Like the one surrounding the train station where we met him

356
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
Don't often allow new building

357
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
One reason

358
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Is it new building can go against

359
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Stephen Ansell in

360
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Of homeowners in the US weaved evolved land use controls to the local governments and often they respond

361
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
Find very much to Neighborhood associations

362
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
Interest

363
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
So

364
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,063
I think there are a lot of reasons that people opposed new housing near them

365
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
But one of the main ones that

366
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903
Been out there for a long time is

367
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
Thinking about single-family home owners

368
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
As a kind of cartel

369
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:27,327
Where they get together include to prevent new Supply

370
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
In order that their assets

371
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Increase in value

372
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
That's interesting cuz nobody really think so

373
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Homeowners

374
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,543
Where's as a cartel at their thought of his like living the American dream

375
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
Yeah I mean I think and that's a problem with the way we think about housing in the United States right so we want housing to be affordable on the one hand

376
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,855
But if we own a house we might be happy when that house increases in value right and so I think people often

377
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,159
Their own minds don't realize what's happening

378
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
The second reason people opposed more building in their neighborhood

379
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
Is that they could simply be afraid of having their lives disrupted by the

380
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Changes by the

381
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Construction

382
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:06,495
People think that the city might come in and bulldoze their house and put up a public housing unit when in fact what would happen is

383
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
As people sell their houses

384
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
From year to year

385
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
Some people that want a single-family house might buy that in

386
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
Keep it the same

387
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
In some cases a developer might buy it

388
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,295
And tear it down and build a 4-story building or something

389
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:25,695
There are neighborhoods like this in LA and people like them they're not unpopular neighborhoods so I don't think that people

390
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:31,839
I kind of understand how the the change would affect the quality of life and I think it would be probably minimal

391
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
More legitimately publishes

392
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
A third reason is it people worried that there will be more traffic

393
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
More congestion

394
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
10 in their neighbor

395
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:43,871
Of course that worries someone addressed at the building takes place near public transit and also

396
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
Some neighborhood and

397
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
He is going to have

398
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
Set the traffic Pablo's point is it

399
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,551
The traffic would be more evenly distributed throughout the city

400
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,111
If more building were allowed in the wealthier neighbor

401
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,487
1/4 reason to some communities have opposed more building is it they just don't like developer

402
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,655
And also we have a recent paper we look at an experiment where we give people different reasons to oppose

403
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:13,055
Housing Development and we found that the one that elicits the most opposition to a hypothetical project is when we

404
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,359
We say that the developers going to make a lot of money

405
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,199
So this is the one reason that actually doesn't affect Peoples Neighborhood

406
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,503
But there's kind of this fairness

407
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
Repugnant

408
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:26,111
Idea where developer getting ripped off or something

409
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:31,231
I think it's connected to people seeing housing as kind of an important accessory for for human life

410
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
And then

411
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
Disliking people that profit off that

412
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,607
When often they themselves are profiting off

413
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
The fact

414
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
Did there's a scarce supply of housing

415
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:46,079
So people are complicated and often holds contradictory opinions and finally one of the effects of Provera

416
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
New building Pablo says

417
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Is it a computer

418
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,687
City segregated by wealth and in some cases

419
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Buy racing

420
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,063
Ethnicity people who live in apartments in pay rent on average make less money than people

421
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Who own homes

422
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,183
But those apartments are not getting built in areas with a lot of single family

423
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Mike Holmes

424
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,767
So final reason also the ugliest reason

425
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
Is it some communities

426
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Want to exclude categories

427
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
The people from living in their neighbor

428
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
Now there's no simple solution

429
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,543
To the conflict between communities that feel they have the right to decide for themselves what their neighborhood

430
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
What you look like

431
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
Anthony from warehousing

432
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:24,479
But Papa said when housing costs remain unaffordable it doesn't just hurt people who were forced to leave

433
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Thriving area B

434
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
They couldn't afford rent or people who couldn't

435
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
Afford to live there in the first place

436
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,647
It also affects future Generations

437
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:38,047
Papa said the paper from Economist Raj Chetty some of the County's where it's best you know for your life

438
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,863
Best prospects to be born to a low-income family

439
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
Are in the Bay Area or in LA

440
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,311
And so by preventing low-income households from from living here we're denying their children the chance to kind of had a better future

441
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:55,199
Critzer knows when making it impossible for low-income people to move to somebody's high growth areas

442
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:01,599
It also has an effect that reverberates down to the Next Generation or multiple Generations even

443
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,743
Yep that sucks California

444
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
After the break

445
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
We take to the Sea

446
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
We go to a port

447
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,215
And side note one of the best things about being a reporter is it

448
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,543
You can be a grown woman and still ask people to honk their horns for you

449
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:27,199
How long do you want it for

450
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
The first one

451
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:38,719
That's something that we're not supposed to do anymore we became adults I didn't know that

452
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351

Man actually still is talking about

471
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
Is possible trade war between the US and

472
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
China

473
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,567
Because California is among other things

474
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
Homes the biggest ports in the country

475
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Port of Long Beach in

476
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
Port of Los Angeles ship nearly 390

477
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
Billion dollars worth

478
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Worth of goods

479
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,319
So you can see this is the

480
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,719
The greater Harbor the state-of-the-art terminal be here will you see the screens movie

481
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
The Port of Long Beach is the

482
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
Long stretch of coast

483
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
Southern California giant white and red cranes

484
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Hang out over the water in

485
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
Huge ships crawling along the bay

486
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,519
I'm here with Mario Cordero he's the executive director of

487
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,127
He points out this massive pile of lumber being loaded onto ships

488
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,199
Bound for Asia there's a big oil tanker on the horizon

489
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,503
And an enormous white ship called

490
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,647
Is launches a satellite to satellite

491
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:17,791
Oh my gosh Ecuador satellites down there

492
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
Wow

493
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
And then they're just like

494
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
Stacks and stacks and stacks

495
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:29,311
Stacks of shipping containers all different colors over there we moved over to the 375

496
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
5 million containers

497
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
Coming from and going to

498
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
China

499
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
You invite him as a president

500
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Of the board of Harbor

501
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
Commission for the port of long

502
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
She loves

503
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
I think it's beautiful

504
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
I think it's a piece of art

505
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:48,255
I mean everything that everybody has their homes is touched by the Port of Long Beach and one way or the other

506
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,279
Is that true

507
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,815
I think so

508
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,935
I mean really about textiles and in electronics and furniture and

509
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
Clothing in

510
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,775
You know they're all good to come through the port

511
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,359
Glenn says more than 7 million teus

512
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
Please come to the Port of Long Beach

513
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
What's a teu

514
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
A total equivalent unit

515
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,575
What's the total equivalent units equivalent unit

516
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Are those the big

517
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
The boxes

518
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
You just go like right onto the back of the truck right now

519
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
A teu is basically the back of a semi-truck

520
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
And the Port of Long Beach moved

521
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
Seven and a half million of them last year

522
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,400
The stuff in those

523
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,448
Use is going to retailers

524
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,240
Walmart and Target and Lowe's

525
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
In the port

526
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Facilitates

527
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,592
The deals between shipping companies and these retail

528
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,688
Mario Cordero says that the poor business all about volume

529
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
Sport makes more money

530
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
When more ships

531
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,016
In and out

532
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,064
The last decade business has been on

533
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,904
Hair the economy's been growing us consumers have been buying more stuff

534
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
Has been expanding

535
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,488
And ships have been getting bigger and bigger to me

536
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
The Port of Long Beach has been investing

537
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
Billions of dollars

538
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
Accommodate

539
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
We've been dusted

540
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:02,496
The tuna for billion dollars over a 10-year. To increase our infrastructure here we're ready to

541
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,056
Receive here 20000 teu vessel

542
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
20000 t

543
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,944
You vessels that is a ship that can hold 20,000 semi trucks loaded up with

544
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,784
Like the Benjamin Franklin ship which came through the port last year

545
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
It made a big impression on

546
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,624
20 stories high

547
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,672
That can hold

548
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,976
91 million pair of shoes

549
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,072
This would be like if you tipped over the Empire State Building

550
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
And filled it with shoes

551
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
Shoes from China

552
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:35,008
In fact 70% of The Ships coming to and going from the Port of Long Beach

553
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
Are coming from

554
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
To China

555
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,104
So when the trade War talk started

556
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Between China and the US

557
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,432
Luigi Mario Grand Hyatt

558
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,016
Do you remember when you heard about the tariffs

559
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,320
Do you remember like where you were when you heard that news

560
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,672
Yes I was glued to the TV like I've been glued to the TV for the last 18 months

561
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
When am I overweight

562
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,560
They were waiting for China and the US to release the list of things that would be

563
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
Text

564
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:01,632
And when those lips finally came out

565
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Poured over

566
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Right away

567
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
Demario sollozzo

568
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Nuts

569
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,032
Fruit you also sell Steel

570
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Aluminum

571
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,848
The Port of Long Beach ships all of this

572
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,896
The Mario says the list

573
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,432
It was actually kind of a relief

574
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,224
Because the Lion's Share of their business

575
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
Was not on the

576
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
Here at the Port of Long Beach are largest commodity that

577
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,368
It's important is in fact furniture

578
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,696
You know and that's at the tune of

579
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,976
25%

580
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
25% of what comes in here is like

581
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
Dressers in couches and beds

582
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
Furniture

583
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,656
Which is the reason

584
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,496
For The Targets in the lows in Nederland Walmart

585
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,056
Naddition number 2 is Footwear

586
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:42,848
So

587
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
Right now

588
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:48,480
Those bodies have not been talked about in terms of the Tariff discussion

589
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,040
Those items are on the Tariff list right now

590
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,344
What Donald Trump has talked a lot about rethinking

591
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Betrayed and

592
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,392
Deals

593
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
He scrapped the transpacific

594
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
Partnership deal

595
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
Repeat early on in his presidency

596
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,560
And he's talked about throwing out NAFTA and

597
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,120
Of course there's the trade War talk with China that has been asked

598
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,168
And this is happening just as

599
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:07,936
The Port of Long Beach

600
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:08,960
Just finishing up

601
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,728
4 + 1/2

602
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,008
Billion dollar

603
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
Remodeling to accommodate bigger

604
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,408
I mean there is a possibility that at least for a little while for the foreseeable future

605
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:23,040
Free trade is going to move backwards in this country inn and the larger ships won't have

606
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
Maybe as

607
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
Much of a future as we

608
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,184
Thought it going backwards

609
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,744
Even in a temporary nature whatsoever

610
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,792
Really I'm cuz it does seem like

611
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:39,424
Maybe were in a moment's at least politically that we may be stepping back from free trade and and

612
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
You know I mean if if huge tears get put in place

613
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
There's nothing you could do

614
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Let's 2018 not the night

615
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
1930s

616
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
That's true

617
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,504
Have you just think things are too interconnected and globalized to go

618
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,320
I think that the economy is so in

619
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
Integrated and Link anymore

620
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,440
Got to admire her optimism it's true

621
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
When points out the present

622
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
Trump got a lot of backlash

623
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,304
From Farmers over the China Terrace

624
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,352
And she also noted some reports that

625
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,168
The Trump Administration has been reconsidering entering the

626
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,728
PT. That's all still really uncertain

627
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,056
Raven shoulder and says they are covering their bases

628
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
See you tomorrow been exploring trade routes in

629
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,896
To South America and even Africa

630
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,712
And that's a tiny part of the port's business now

631
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
But she says they've got to be ready for

632
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,088
After all Luanne wants to keep ships moving in and out of the pool

633
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,136
In fact she says sometimes she just likes

634
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,416
To go out on the pier

635
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,816
I need to be able to see the terminals and the cranes and the ships moving in and out of the harbor

636
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:45,472
It's a it's a wonderful appreciation of this economic engine

637
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:55,712
That's the piece of art that's the artwork

638
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:02,112
