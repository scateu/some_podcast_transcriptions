00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,608
Just a quick note Today's Show originally ran in 2015

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,936
I've been going to Sushi Bar since I was a little kid

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:12,032
But in all that time I've never been on the other side of the sushi

4
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:12,800
I've never been

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,336
Back where the chefs dance

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,640
Last week we made it back there

7
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:22,016
Thanks to chefs team Alicia Coppola at the sushi restaurant Jewel Bako in Manhattan

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,088
What's the most popular fish to sell

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,440
Poop pooping officiant

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,232
Tuna they've got lots

11
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
Of tuna

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:41,728
No wonder, the second most populated

13
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,264
You don't expect

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
Served and eaten

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568
Basically every

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,616
Sea urchin of Coricidin

17
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:52,224
Poisonous Blowfish versus got a special license in Japan for pear poisonous

18
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,296
But in all his years as a sushi chef

19
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,088
He's never ever had

20
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,112
A single bite

21
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,136
Of raw salmon

22
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,464
I'm about to eat the South

23
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,512
Never

24
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,328
I never eat them the same way you know

25
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,680
So never you never even taking one bite of raw salmon

26
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
Can we get you to try it today

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
Not that long ago

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
Everybody in Japan was like you

29
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
Ishikawa

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
Nobody ate Roxanne

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
It was like eating raw pork

32
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
It just wasn't done

33
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
And then

34
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
A few people Halfway Around the World

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,256
Marshall plan to change

36
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm taking cold

And I just Jay today on the show

38
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,520

39
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,224

There are so many different labels on food these days

50
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Organic

51
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
Non-GMO

52
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Fair trade

Freehand gathered it's overwhelming

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:39,232
I sometimes jokingly refer to it as been a scarring of our food life get has a new episode making sense

60
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
When we talk about

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,800
International trade you know we often didn't to talk about thing

62
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Like tariffs

63
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Quotev

64
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,944
There's this idea that if you get rid of those things get rid of those barriers

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,272
New products just come rushing in across borders

66
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,344
But clearly that is not always the

67
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
Sometimes you have to spend

68
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
Years and years and years

69
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,304
Working and begging and trying to convince an entire country that

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,632
Whatever thing you have a lot of wood everything you want to sell

71
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
Is something they should want to buy

72
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
Like paper example salmon

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
In Norwich

74
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
Hello

75
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
Villa, Altamonte

76
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
Hello can you hear us

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688
The other day we were trying to connect to this

78
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,016
Video and Trump set on this little island in Northern Norway

79
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,344
We overheard them talking about us in Norwegian

80
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,440
Public in Santa Marta Colombia

81
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,768
Mooney Mooney planet

82
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Hello

83
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Hello

84
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
Does Planet Money translate as money planet

85
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
Is that right

86
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
This is Bjorn adac

87
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:59,104
And when we talked to him the other day he told us that back around the time you graduate from

88
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
This is a few decades

89
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Norway had

90
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
The government had been

91
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
Subsidizing the Norwegian fishing in

92
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
For decades

93
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
I've basically been paying people to

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,928
And of course when you subsidize something you get more of it

95
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
It's not a very

96
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:20,607
Clever way of using money because the more you use their the worst situation get

97
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
The government says

98
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Okay

99
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
Let's wind down these

100
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,031
We're not going to screw over our fishing industry

101
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,895
Let's figure out a way to get the rest of the world to buy our fish

102
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,223
They look around the world and they see one country in Virginia

103
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,807
Really loves fish and that needs to start importing more

104
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Yes

105
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
Japan at the time

106
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
Salmon sushi

107
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
Is not a thing

108
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
Not in Japan not in Norway

109
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Sure it's

110
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Cured or smoked

111
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
But a hunk of raw salmon

112
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
No

113
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,167
And in fact the idea of salmon sushi just began is this

114
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,751
Tiny little little thing at the Norwegian Embassy in Tokyo

115
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
They were just

116
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
Playing around with ways to

117
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,871
To serve Norwegian products in a Japanese style

118
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
They just try let's try

119
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
To have a little bit Solomon

120
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
Drawer

121
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,551
Just in the end Amphitheatre

122
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,647
Thundershift under ambassador

123
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
Around this time

124
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
Don't get hired by the Norwegian government

125
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
Too selfish to the Japanese

126
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Used to be a fisherman

127
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
He speaks Japanese

128
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
Kind of the perfect guy for this mission

129
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Any figures

130
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
Yeah sure we could sell salmon

131
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
Cheap in Japan

132
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
Can people in Japan already eat salmon

133
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Grilled

134
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
But when people buy fish to use for sushi

135
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,663
They're willing to pay a lot more

136
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,759
Sometimes people pay five times as much for the same kind of fish

137
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
If it's going to be used

138
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
So if you can get people into

139
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
Japan to eat salmon sushi

140
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,671
Don't make all that Norwegian salmon much

141
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
More value

142
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
Sofi Ryan goes to Tokyo

143
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,095
And he gets a bunch of Japanese fish industry Executives into a conference

144
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
And he unveils the next

145
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Salmon

146
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,263
And they say directly over the table

147
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
It's impossible

148
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
We Japanese

149
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,359
Do not eat salmon Raw

150
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,455
Well just put it's good to taste good

151
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
No they say

152
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
It doesn't taste good

153
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
They say the color is wrong also its

154
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
It's too it's too late Reddit should be right there

155
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
The state that has a smell

156
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,999
And also because they knew the shape of the salmon and it said that

157
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
The head has the Bronx Tale

158
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,863
And the Gillis look wrong everything is wrong so

159
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Everything

160
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
Everything The Taste the smell

161
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
The texture

162
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,519
The fact that the color of everything

163
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
What did you think when they said that

164
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
This this this is completely crazy because we are human beings

165
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,551
Phoenix Japanese but we have taste and we have feeling in ormiston

166
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
How is delicious and I think

167
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
Happy Japanese awesomest

168
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
Feel the same as I do

169
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,279
Of course what you taste when you bite into something isn't just

170
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
Like a chemical reaction

171
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,655
And it's not just the fundamental molecular properties of the finger eating

172
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,215
You taste all the baggage you bring into it

173
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,591
The more I started to dig into the the more I became aware of the importance of

174
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
Bjorn's Big Challenge was this

175
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
He's going to have to change the perception

176
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
Of an entire country of

177
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,111
People people who thought the color or the shape of the head of salmon

178
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
Was all wrong

179
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,719
If you want to change perception if you want to get people to buy something

180
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
What you do is not a miss

181
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
The Luncheonette

182
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
Enzo Buren and his colleagues figured alright

183
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
Start doing some TV commercials

184
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
Maybe have a cute cartoon character

185
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,775
Did you have a mascot like a dancing salmon or something

186
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
A we had but it was it was very silly it was a white cake

187
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
A Viking

188
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Yes yes

189
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:52,319
It was a viking with a helmet and it was like a funny drawing with a big head

190
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,623
Animated Sentinel Eastern Seafood

191
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
He actually sent us a picture

192
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
Of the Viking of the Mask

193
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
I have to say it's like

194
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,327
If you were to imagine what some Outsider trying to

195
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Pander to Japanese audience would come up

196
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
I know that right like it smooth

197
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,031
Super cute little boy Viking with his great big head in like big eyes

198
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,823
A huge giant fork

199
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
Yeah like as tall as he is

200
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
And so the Vikings surprise

201
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
Partly because there was this

202
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Really

203
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,063
Bigger problem about getting Japanese people

204
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Apple to eat raw

205
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,159
And that was they were afraid that raw salmon had

206
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Parasites

207
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,511
People in Japan were used to eating this kind of salmon

208
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
Dependents have parasites in it

209
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
And would make you

210
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
Stick if you eat it raw

211
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Bjorn says

212
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,959
The salmon from Norway was totally different

213
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
Parasites just born a problem

214
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
But it's not like you want to just

215
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Run an ad in Japan that said

216
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
Don't worry our salmon is parasite

217
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,503
We didn't want to mention it at all because if you if you say that

218
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,855
My my my fishes has no poison than you say is no

219
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Pyside is no

220
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
It's no bad things in it

221
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,999
So then people will also say that

222
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,839
Yeah the first thing I'll think of is if their voice

223
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
Yeah yeah yeah

224
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Why do they save it

225
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Why do they keep saying that

226
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,727
So we didn't say that at all

227
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,079
We concentrated our information to the consumers about

228
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
The cold

229
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,431
Pure Norwegian sea water

230
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,503
Just put the thing the pictures of all the

231
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Fjords

232
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
Mountains

233
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,647
I sent additional fishing boats and end

234
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
Then then you gave the impression about

235
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
Is some something that is

236
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Pure and fresh

237
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Pure and fresh

238
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,655
Not enough to get Japan to start eating raw Sam

239
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
After years of AD campaigns

240
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,799
Norwegian salmon still haven't taken off in the Japanese sushi Market

241
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,383
And the country's fishing industry the wholesalers are at the

242
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
Supermarkets in distributors

243
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
They just wouldn't buy it

244
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,063
It didn't matter whether ordinary people were worried about parasites

245
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
Whether they love the viking mask

246
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
Heat of the Viking mascot

247
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,463
Big companies that control the fish business weren't convinced

248
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
Salmon sushi wasn't going to go any

249
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,375
And back in or wait their Norwegian salmon industry was getting desperate

250
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,007
The glut was getting so bad that they start selling industrial size freezers with

251
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
Tons and tons of salmon

252
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
The Japanese wanted to buy some of that song

253
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
But not for sushi

254
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
We wanted to sell it cheap for

255
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,831
For grilling smoked so companies that wanted to sell it on out on the market for for grilling etcetera and they said no

256
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
We don't want it there

257
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,927
Yuan says there was a lot of pressure for him

258
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
To give up

259
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,511
To just sell the salmon to whoever would buy it

260
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
But he thought

261
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
He just needed

262
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
One big deal

263
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,191
One company that would believe in his idea of salmon sushi

264
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
In a minute

265
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751

So pure and is trying to find somebody in Japan

278
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
To buy into his

279
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
Dream of Japanese people eating raw salmon

280
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
And there was this one company called nichirei

281
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,111
That he's been building a relationship with

282
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Everybody in Japan knows this company

283
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,487
They're like Kraft or Stouffer's or something in

284
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
They self

285
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,071
Frozen food you know dumplings chicken nuggets

286
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Squid

287
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
Bjorn told them I will sell you

288
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,703
5000 tons of that frozen salmon

289
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
For really cheap

290
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
All you have to do

291
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Is salad in the grocery stores

292
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
As sushi

293
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
Just try it

294
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
Nichirei said yes

295
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Yuan how to deal

296
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
Ready for the day of happiness

297
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
I remember that then and the

298
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:12,159
It was like being in the heaven if you see what I mean just the happiness

299
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
That was shared

300
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,999
You have a history of money hundred years of

301
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
Sushi consumption in Japan

302
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
And this

303
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
It's almost not the pocket with

304
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,703
There was a feeling of of making history

305
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,287
When's nichirei start selling salmon for sushi

306
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
The idea of salmon sushi Des teams

307
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
More normal

308
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
You'll be like if I don't know if in this country

309
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
Dannon

310
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Started selling

311
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Yogurt with

312
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Raw pork

313
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:48,255
Definitely not something I would have come up with but I've been eating Dannon Yogurt on my life

314
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
Never made me sick

315
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,911
Whatever maybe I'll just throw one park at the bottom in along with my strawberry banana

316
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
My shopping cart

317
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
Pretty soon salmon sushi start showing up

318
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Everywhere engine

319
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,591
Especially in those conveyor belt sushi restaurant

320
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
This has meant

321
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,967
Applebee's of Japan almost everybody is trying

322
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,551
Tadashi Ono is a sushi chef he's 53 now

323
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,879
The first time he tasted salmon sushi it was about 20 years ago and

324
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
It did not go well I was scared

325
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
Yasso

326
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
Couldn't he enjoy it

327
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
I wasn't either

328
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
Clear about how it taste

329
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
I was

330
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,911
Thinking about how my God

331
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,751
Am I going to get sick or do you know what kind of stuff he didn't get that

332
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
And he wanted to understand

333
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,359
Why everybody was so into raw salmon

334
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
And he kept trying it

335
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,015
The first time I said maybe

336
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
So you know I started liking Gates

337
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Actually you.

338
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Buttery

339
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,975
Creamy melt in your mouth

340
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
It's creamy and it melts in your mouth

341
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,327
Yeah it is in the way

342
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
You know it's very soft meat

343
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,959
This really is a testament to how malleable art

344
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Rkc

345
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Can food art

346
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Fashion whatever

347
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:09,407
So that's what he told us there was a taboo against eating raw salmon

348
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,479
Of even touching Rock

349
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
A few tries later

350
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
He's in love with it it's like

351
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,855
We imagine that we would never ever

352
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
Eat something or wear something

353
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
And then we do

354
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
I'm a very stubborn guy so it's like

355
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
My mind is say it's hard to change

356
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
But you changed your mind in this case

357
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
I did

358
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Why

359
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Because the ingredients is good

360
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
Tadashi says

361
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
Hammond Sushi is his teenage daughter's

362
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Favorite

363
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,943
She had no idea that it used to be taboo

364
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,015
Not long after the need to re deal Bjorn move back to New

365
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
A few hours later he was back in Tokyo visiting on

366
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
And that was when he knew

367
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Salmon sushi

368
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
One day he was walking around

369
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,791
And he noticed these little plastic Sushi replicas

370
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
In the restaurant windows

371
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,655
And then suddenly I saw there was some oh no

372
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Plastic copas

373
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Percentage

374
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
In the sushi shops

375
