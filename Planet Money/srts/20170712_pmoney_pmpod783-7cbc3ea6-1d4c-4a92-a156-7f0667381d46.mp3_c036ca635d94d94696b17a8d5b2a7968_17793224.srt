1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:04,608
We're going to start Today Show by telling you the story of an innocent man

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,656
Amanda Mustafa Willis

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,960
The Story begins in the summer of 2010

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,264
Stop it was 24 years old

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,544
He's a tall guy

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
Wears his hair in laundry

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,408
And one day he was just walking down the street Newark New Jersey

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,688
Minding his own business

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,712
Eating a baguette

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,016
All of a sudden he's a cop car

11
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,320
Coming the wrong way down a one-way Street

12
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,136
The car stops right in front of him out, cop

13
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,720
Yeah they ran at me like I just like they just jumped out like that

14
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:37,120
Was swarming out like they knew they were looking for and you know I still did a whole bunch of other guys they just ran and

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,168
I just stood there they Place me on the rest

16
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,704
The cops found a gun at the scene

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,752
And they said the gun was mustafa's

18
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,056
Who's taking downtown thrown in jail

19
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,848
Charged with unlawful possession

20
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,200
And this is where your constitutional protections are supposed to kick in

21
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,760
The gun charge is just an accusation

22
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,320
Mustafa hadn't been convicted of anything

23
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,112
This is how the system is supposed to work

24
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,672
Mustafa is supposed to go home to his job at

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
And his family

26
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,976
And start Gathering some evidence

27
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
Prove that the gun

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
It's not his

29
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,584
All he has to do is post bail

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
And he's free to go

31
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
$50,000

32
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
Set by the judge and he can

33
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Walk out of

34
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,008
He doesn't even have to come up with the whole amount right all he needs is

35
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
Is 10%

36
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,848
Cincinnati can pay the bail bondsman his feet 5000 bucks

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
And then he has to find somebody to guarantee

38
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
The rest

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
And he's free to go

40
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,272
Dumb stuff I didn't have five thousand bucks for the 10% fee

41
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,064
And his family didn't want to be on the hook

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,088
450 thousand

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
So he's facing

44
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
Roodle choice

45
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
He can either

46
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
Tough it out in jail

47
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,000
Or

48
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,048
Plead guilty to a crime that he didn't come

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,632
But I told the public defender listen man I didn't do it

50
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,728
He said well you're probably sitting in here pending grand jury man I said well

51
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:51,616
Hey I guess I'm have to do it tonight it ain't my weapon so there is no way I'm going

52
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
To plead guilty to a crime I didn't

53
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
So he just sits in jail

54
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
Hand weights

55
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
But he was locked up

56
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,344
Mustafa lost his job driving a delivery truck

57
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
He missed his cousin's funeral

58
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,440
All because he couldn't afford to pay

59
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
Finally after a couple months

60
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,560
The judge lowered mustafa's bail to $30,000

61
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
And his family feel

62
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
Once he was out

63
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936
Mustafa could dig up evidence to fight the gun charge

64
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
It turns out

65
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,776
It was somebody on the Block who shot a video that

66
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
Mustafa says

67
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
Cruz the gun wasn't

68
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
The prosecutor the got hole today

69
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,224
Immediately she wanted to dismiss

70
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
This is what we stopped at

71
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
I've been saying all along

72
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
The charges were

73
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
But still

74
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
She had to spend

75
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
3 months in jail

76
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
For something he didn't do

77
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,744
And he ends up falling this bail bondsman

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,120
3000 bucks no refund that fee I was in dead from this and I had to pay

79
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:49,728
All this money back to a bail bondsman company for something that I didn't even did

80
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,800
And the case was still dismissed and I still have to pay

81
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
But not for nothing

82
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
Hell is supposed to help you

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Who got charged with

84
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,456
The crime give them away to go home until their trial

85
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,784
But Mustafa Bale didn't help him get out of jail

86
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,136
Bill is what kept Him locked up

87
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,440
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

88
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
And I'm Keith Romer

89
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
Bails been around for stench

90
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,840
It's pretty much the law of the land in every state in this

91
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,680
It's supposed to protect the rights of defendants like Mustafa

92
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
You haven't been convicted of anything

93
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,312
And at the same time Bill is supposed to give quartz an extra guarantee

94
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
The people are actually going to show up

95
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
What is bail

96
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Is broken

97
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Today on the show

98
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
The New Jersey bail experience

99
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,320
Bunch of people who normally would not agree on anything

100
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
Got together

101
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
Change the bail system

102
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Their solution

103
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
They threw it out

104
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Support for this podcast

Is children more information is available at aecf. Org

109
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,872
The first thing you need to understand about

110
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,432
Is that it is basically a workaround

111
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,736
For this fundamental problem in the

112
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
In a perfect world

113
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
If somebody got accused of a crime

114
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
The trial would happen

115
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
In a perfect world

116
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
His world that's perfect but has crime in

117
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Hear me out

118
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,512
You'll get a trial the same day

119
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
If you're guilty you would go out to prison

120
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
If you're innocent you would go free

121
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
But in the real world

122
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
There is a lot of time

123
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Between that moment when somebody's arrested

124
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,263
And when the jury figures out what the right ver

125
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
You can't just lock up everybody in

126
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Because

127
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
You know that annoying thing about innocent

128
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
But if you just arrest them

129
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,759
Buddy and then immediately let him go

130
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,575
There's nothing necessarily to stop that guy from running off the bridge

131
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
Bell is a sort of compromise right

132
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Will let you go until your trial

133
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
If you give us some money

134
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,279
$10,000 or $100,000 whatever it is

135
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
Show up at your trial

136
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Get your money back

137
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,631
Not everybody thinks this is such a

138
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
A great sister

139
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
We talk to Roseanne Scotti

140
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,263
She is the sort of lawyer who looks at the criminal justice

141
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
The menses

142
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Injured

143
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,639
She's the state director for the drug policy Alliance

144
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,735
And she thinks that this whole Bale compromise we've been talking about

145
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,063
Is pretty obviously unfair for one big reason

146
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:17,951
Which is it not everybody has the kind of money to be able to pay their bail understand is that

147
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:23,839
You know one of the things that most people who are in jail have in common is that they're poor

148
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,751
And so for these individuals having $1,000 bail or $2,500 bail

149
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
It might as well have been a million.

150
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Spell

151
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,127
It's a pretty serious flaw it's built right into the

152
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943
Bail is way harder on poor people

153
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
Okay so that's lawyer number one

154
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,831
Lawyer number 2 is guy named Elie honig

155
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,439
He's the Assistant Attorney General in New Jersey he's in charge of criminal prosecution to the entire state

156
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,487
And he had a completely different

157
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
Problem of the Bells

158
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,607
For him the real trouble with how the bail system treated rich

159
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,775
The right to bail was in mashed in the New Jersey state constitution we had a constitutional provision that said

160
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,847
Every criminal defendant is entitled to bail.

161
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,943
There's some people Ellie says who just should not be allowed to post bail at all

162
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,087
When you're looking at the leader of a racketeering Enterprise a Mafia Family a large drug trafficking organization

163
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
You could have

164
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Kingpin

165
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
Somebody who's dangerous somebody you charged with murders

166
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
Now those folks can come up with money

167
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,839
Add the notion that those people could have could buy their way out of jail

168
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
It was really problematic

169
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,447
There's a reason Ellie gets so worked up about

170
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
He used to be a federal process

171
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
And the FEDS

172
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,543
Do not have a law

173
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,591
Like the one in New Jersey that says everybody my

174
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:45,759
Ellie's new boss is New Jersey Governor Chris Christie he used to be a federal prosecutor he's used to the federal system

175
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
In 2012

176
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,111
He proposed a constitutional amendment in New Jersey

177
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,671
Create something called preventive detention

178
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
Basically

179
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Giving judges the right

180
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
Hold somebody without any bail whatsoever

181
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
New Jersey

182
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
They didn't go for

183
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
His plan did not make it out of the

184
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,703
To Roseanne Scotti the lawyer who's trying to make the whole system more fair

185
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,031
Chrissy's playing just look like a classic Law & Order me

186
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
Exactly what you did

187
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Expect from a process

188
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Security is now a politic

189
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,199
We thought that preventive detention alone

190
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
Would not

191
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,623
In any way solve the problem will probably make things worse because you would have preventive detention as a

192
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
New tool to keep people

193
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
I'm in jail

194
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,767
Jail by the way is where you wait for trial or

195
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
Serve short sentences

196
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Prison is for people who are serving law

197
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
For folks like Scotty the problem was

198
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
But there were too many

199
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Not tfue

200
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
To try to make a case

201
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
She got her hands on the jail population

202
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
Data for the entire

203
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
In looking at the population we found that 40% of the people who were in our jails were there

204
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Solely

205
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,367
Because they lack the money for often nominal amount of money bail

206
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Literally

207
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Thousands of people

208
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
If you haven't been convicted

209
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Of anything

210
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
Sitting in jail waiting for their trials

211
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
Just because they were poor

212
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
And that weight was not trivial

213
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,375
The average length of

214
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,215
The time for someone who had officially been indicted but hadn't yet gone to trial

215
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
What's 314 days

216
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
That's 10 months

217
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,663
Well people are sitting in there in jail for months and sometimes years

218
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,759
You know they're losing jobs are losing family they're using losing housing

219
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,087
All that time in jail is obviously bad in Nevada

220
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,135
No one wants to just sit in jail

221
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
But on top of that

222
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
You can start the change

223
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
Actual legal outcome

224
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,071
Weather people end up being found guilty or innocent

225
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Prosecutors are not

226
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
They know that people just want to go

227
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
And they know that that give them a lot of

228
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,079
There is a phenomenon which I think you're not supposed to talk about publicly but I will

229
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:52,479
I called the time served and what that man is you would have defendants who would be held on low money Bells

230
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,783
Couldn't post it and they would sit there in

231
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
Jail for

232
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
346 months

233
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
And then when they came out to make the next appearance their lawyer would say

234
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
You been in 6 months

235
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
If you take this please you walk out today

236
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,559
And so you got that plate was an easy way to get please

237
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
How common a practice

238
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
I'm very,

239
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,703
I mean I think it happened probably in every County

240
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,007
Across the state so first

241
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
You get punished

242
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Then

243
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
At the end of your jail time

244
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
Time to figure out whether or not you actually

245
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
It's a crazy system

246
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
Or you can just plead guilty even if

247
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:30,623
You're not since that means you get to go home now instead of waiting however many more months it isn't

248
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Until your trial

249
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
This was such

250
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
A terribly

251
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Broken

252
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
Unfair

253
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
Hauling system it was such

254
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
You know just bald

255
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,031
Naked Injustice and angrily corruption is a corrupt system

256
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
In 2013 Roseanne's organization put out

257
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
They basically said

258
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
This is how screwed up New Jersey's bails

259
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,759
Now I don't want to sound cynical but

260
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
Usually a report

261
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Is where stories like this

262
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
Well-intentioned organization puts out

263
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
Report

264
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
Joe Rose does a heart-rending NPR story

265
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
Everyone shakes their heads

266
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
And they say Dad is

267
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Right

268
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
But nothing really

269
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
But in New Jersey

270
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
The report copy I of

271
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,591
The Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court

272
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
He calls everyone into his ceremonial

273
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
The judges

274
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
The public defenders

275
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
The ACLU the prosecutor in LA

276
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Ellie's in the room

277
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Can you tell them

278
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Fix it

279
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
Lot of lawyers

280
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Lottery

281
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:40,511
We got some people say you got a lot of lawyers together they can't get nothing done I think this is it

282
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,815
An example to the contrary we got quite a bit

283
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
All those wires came up with a

284
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
To get rid of bail altogether

285
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
After the break

286
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
What was in that plan

287
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,799
How do you replace a system that we've been relying on 400

288
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,151
Support for this podcast and the following message come from Slack

289
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,991
Used by companies all over the world to get everything done

290
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
Where every part of work

291
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,391
From documents to decisions is stored archived and searchable in seconds

292
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,463
Slack where work happens find out why

293
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
Is slack.com

294
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
The most obvious proud

295
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
Problem with getting rid of bail

296
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,423
Is figuring out a new way of deciding who gets out before their trial and who stayed locked

297
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
Ellie says the old system was bad

298
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
But

299
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,079
It was simple under our old system the first thing a judge would do

300
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,151
Jack look at the charge against the defendant look at the chart and say

301
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,199
Okay his money bail is X

302
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
Post-it he walks out

303
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
If not he sits in jail until trial

304
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Judges have a problem

305
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
If you take away the bail and bail chart

306
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,999
What are they supposed to do I don't know maybe use actual information about the real world

307
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Oh

308
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
You mean like data

309
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
I mean

310
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Big

311
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Oh Big Daddy

312
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,703
Don't researchers have been trying to solve this problem

313
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
4 years

314
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Before New Jersey start messing around.

315
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
Is that a team of researchers

316
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
I'm the Laura and John Arnold Foundation

317
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
They get the data of a million and a half people

318
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
Cases from all around the country

319
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
And they run that data through a bunch of

320
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Statistical now

321
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
And they create something called

322
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
A risk

323
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,695
This algorithm basically predicts

324
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,023
How likely somebody is to fail to show up to court

325
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
And How likely they are to commit a new

326
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
At the risk assessment

327
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
Is automatically run

328
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,727
And it immediately spits out a result of 126

329
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,823
I on two different scales one day in love six being hot it's not even that,

330
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
The algorithm just looks at me

331
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Does the defendant have

332
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
Prior conviction for a crime of violence

333
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,807
Has that conviction occurred within the past X number of years

334
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,623
You know has the defendant had

335
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
Failure to appear or bench warrant issued in Prior case

336
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,535
Interesting Lee one of the factors is how old the defendant

337
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
At the time the crime was committed

338
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,911
If your under the age of 23 says the algorithm

339
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,495
You're actually more likely to commit a new crime and somebody who is older

340
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,567
Not everyone thought this algorithm though it was such a good idea

341
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
The reactions to

342
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
To the risk assessment tool register

343
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,199
And I think it's fair to say that it first

344
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
There was

345
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Pretty broad skepticism

346
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
First reason for the skepticism

347
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,367
The whole thing just seemed a little like sci-fi

348
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,695
I think of the movie Minority Report with Tom Cruise where

349
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,791
You know they feed the information to these cyborgs like beings who predict

350
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Future

351
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,959
The precogs and that makes people uneasy precogs to the Future and they're never wrong ever get any false positives

352
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
Someone intends to kill a boss or his wife but they never go through with it how does prepass tell the difference

353
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,271
And it is weird right like the algorithm

354
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,623
Looks at all this information about you like have you committed a crime before did you skip your

355
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
Glass Court

356
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
And it says

357
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Okay there's a

358
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
40% chance that

359
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,047
You are going to commit a new crime before your trial

360
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
So you have to stay locked

361
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,423
Because of something you haven't done something you might do in the future

362
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
And I just feel compelled to point out here that

363
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,751
Precogs

364
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
They weren't always right

365
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
That was the whole point of the movie

366
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
It's the future hasn't happened yet

367
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,455
But okay when you compare this system to one that depended on bail and bail charts

368
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
The pool looks pretty good

369
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
Because now people are being detained

370
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
Based on real in

371
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
About the risk

372
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
To the community

373
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
About the chances if they won't show up

374
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
There is a second concern

375
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
The people have about this risk assessment

376
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
When it comes down to buy us

377
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,167
People complain that the old system was biased against poor people and

378
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Color

379
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,799
And what's to stop a new tool that's based on Big Data from being just as biased against

380
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
The same people

381
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
I asked Roseanne Scotti.

382
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,431
She's the lawyer who fought her entire life to make the justice

383
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
System more just

384
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
She loves the tool

385
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,831
She says the algorithm was specifically designed to avoid the bias

386
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:54,463
I think the key is what it doesn't look at you know some folks were concerned that it would look at

387
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,863
It would be a proxy for race and things like that which it is in it does not look at your ZIP code

388
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Where you live or your neighborhood

389
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,239
Scotty says the algorithm is just as good at identifying risk

390
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
For rich people as it is for pork

391
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Black people

392
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
As it is for white

393
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
Great idea right

394
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
Just get rid of bail

395
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Replace it with the algorithm

396
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
No brainer

397
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
Everyone is going to love

398
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Well

399
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
Everyone except the bail-in

400
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Partly because

401
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,951
It's going to destroy their business entirely because it's going to destroy their butt

402
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
They lobbied superhard

403
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Keep these changes

404
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
From becoming law

405
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,839
They warned about that crazy tsunami of crime that

406
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Wipeout

407
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
The state got rid of

408
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
The fight

409
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
Pass this law was in

410
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775
Hence we were still counting votes the morning of

411
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
It was really not

412
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,895
Hole in the last vote quiz called that we knew we had one

413
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,967
Roseanne and Elli and all the other reformers

414
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
They did win though

415
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
The old system

416
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
As of January 1st of this year

417
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
There is essentially

418
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
No more cash bail

419
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
Remember Mustafa from the beginning of the show

420
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
Under the old system

421
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
She got help

422
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
3 months in jail

423
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
On $50,000

424
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,935
If you want Mustafa to the new algorithm this is what you get

425
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
No prior offenses as an adult

426
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
No bench warrant

427
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,079
On the right side of 23 years old when he was arrested

428
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
She's A1

429
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,151
The lowest score on the wrist

430
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
That means under the new system

431
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
Mustafa almost

432
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
Certainly gets to go home

433
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
Instead of having to spend all that time locked up

434
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
Maybe he doesn't lose his job

435
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
Maybe he gets to go to his cousin's funeral

436
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
That's the new reality in New Jersey

437
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,535
You look at who's in jail and there is this real ship

438
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
More and more

439
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,863
The people who are locked up in jail

440
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
Are the ones who have been convicted of crimes

441
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
Instead of just accused of

442
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
Roseanne Scotti the lawyer who's been working for decades

443
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Make the criminal just

444
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
System Warfare

445
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
She says this is easily one of the biggest achievements

446
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Of her career

447
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:55,295
When we got the first statistics in February

448
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,879
That show that the jail population had been reduced

449
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
I'm by almost 30%

450
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
I cried

451
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
That was

452
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,095
An amazing moment to know that

453
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
You know you had done something

454
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:14,751
We're so many people were now going to go home to their families or communities

455
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,567
And to know that you would made a difference in

456
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
So many people would not

457
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
Face of Injustice

458
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,807
Was very profound

459
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,135
More and more in New Jersey punishment

460
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:37,535
After conviction not before it

461
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,263
