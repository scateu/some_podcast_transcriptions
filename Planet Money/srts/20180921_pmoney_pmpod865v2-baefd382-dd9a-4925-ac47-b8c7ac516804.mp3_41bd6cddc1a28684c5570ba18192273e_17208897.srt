00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,560
The following message

4
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,840
Come from the UPS

5
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,888
Offering services from shredding

6
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,168
To printing to mailbox

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,448
And instead of closing

8
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,472
This Memorial Day we

9
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,008
May 24th and 20

10
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
The UPS Store

11
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,568
He's doing another thing

12
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
All together

13
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Opening

14
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
The UPS Store

15
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,176
Everything for small business

16
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,712
And of course shipping

17
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,248
The other day I have

18
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,272
Early morning

19
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,832
You and I ran downstairs to get a cup of coffee

20
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
And ran into the

21
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:26,880
So

22
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,208
I turned on my recorder and I kind of bombarded her with my mic

23
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,000
Maybe you should say

24
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
Who are you

25
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,584
This is Kathy I'm sorry I don't know what

26
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,032
Catherine rampell imma calling to The Washington Post

27
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,592
Specifically Katherine writes about the economy for

28
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
Washington Post

29
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
It occurred to us that

30
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
Actually

31
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
The coffee shop is

32
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
Perfect

33
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,016
To show this thing that in

34
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
Infuriates

35
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
All right

36
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
So you're looking at an I see what size you looking

37
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
4

38
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,208
Can I get the

39
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,000
16 ounce iced tea

40
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
How much

41
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
3:15

42
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
Does on the board

43
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
289

44
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Taxes

45
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,448
2610

46
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Okay

47
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
Okay so maybe that sounds like somebody buying ice tea and then having

48
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,944
To pay tax

49
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
It only sounds normal

50
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
Because we've gotten used to

51
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
What conference is here

52
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,624
Is one price on the board

53
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,976
And then this extra hidden thing that she has to pay for it's not just taxes

54
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Sometimes it

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,536
It's fees and service charges

56
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
That seems

57
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
Pure out of thin air

58
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,632
Check out and drive us all

59
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Crazy

60
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
Booking rental cars buying

61
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,032
Concert tickets for Lake have you booked hotel room recently sometimes

62
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:53,408
There's an internet fee parking fee sometimes there is something called a resort fee

63
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
Even though you're staying at a place that

64
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Is not a resort

65
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
It's by the highway

66
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
Catherine

67
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
Brought her ice tea

68
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,880
Into the studio to explain why these fees and service charges

69
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,904
We're not just annoying

70
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,696
They are bad for the economy

71
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,256
Company should be competing based on

72
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
Price and quality

73
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
And not

74
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Obfuscation

75
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,656
And the fact that companies do compete on apus

76
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Is not

77
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,520
Create a better economy does not create a better experience

78
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
For consumers

79
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,848
And can infect raise prices

80
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
Consumers that are buying

81
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
Something they don't want

82
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
It's like everyone is a used car

83
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:33,088
I have a very good friend who's a used car salesman so I don't want to denigrate that profession

84
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,696
So what is your one tiny tweak that would change the world

85
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
My my one tiny tweak

86
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
Is that

87
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
We should require

88
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
Moron

89
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Including taxes fees

90
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,496
Particularly in common types of

91
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
Consumer purchases were pplelectric

92
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
Price

93
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Should be

94
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
The price

95
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
That is how Catherine rampell

96
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
Would make the world better

97
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
With one simple trick

98
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Nick Fountain and I'm Kenny Malone and Planet Money we tackle

Big questions but

101
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,352
Today on the show we look for small answers this is something we've done here

102
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,168
Before we caught the smartest people we know and we ask them

103
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
What TV thing would you change about the world

104
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
To make our lives better

105
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,896
We have a suggestion for how you can get more money from your boss how to make the most boring sport

106
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Little less boring and

Okay little tweaks that can make big changes Our Lives go

123
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
First idea

124
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,232
Comes from a labor Economist at the University of Notre Dame

125
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Abigail

126
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
Wozniak

127
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:22,399
So I have actually a little wind up if you are interested in the moment I wish this occurred to me was

128
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,215
A couple of weeks ago so I am

129
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
Naturally a football fan

130
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
Since I come from Green Bay Wisconsin

131
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,383
Haha and I was reading about Aaron Rodgers

132
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
Contract negotiations

133
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Aaron Rodgers is the quarterback

134
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,807
For the Green Bay Packers in over the summer he was asking for more money from the back

135
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,879
And what caught Abby's I was this quote from Raj

136
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
Where he said something like

137
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
Sure

138
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:50,047
I'm in a multimillion-dollar salary negotiation with my bosses but

139
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,839
Whatever I've got an agent

140
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
He's dealing with it

141
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
I'm just going to

142
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,191
Keep practicing football I feel amazed

143
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,799
And I thought that just doesn't sound like any kind of

144
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
Job negotiation that I have ever heard anyone go through personally like a normal person

145
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
They're like

146
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,623
I know this is a good problem to have I know I'm getting a good job but this is the most stressful thing I've ever gone through.

147
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
And

148
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
I think so

149
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
Thing that popped into my head was

150
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
More people should have someone like

151
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
Abby was next week is

152
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
All of us

153
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
Not just famous people

154
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
Should have

155
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:31,263
Agents know she's not saying this has to be your own personal Hollywood agent

156
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Or even an expense

157
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Lawyer

158
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
We know about those kind

159
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
She said

160
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
Make it as a different job

161
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,431
It doesn't exist yet

162
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
ABC

163
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
Intermediary you pay a flat fee

164
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
And then they'll have a couple of conversation

165
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
On your behalf when you need

166
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,903
So imagine Abby gets a call

167
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,487
Hate is the University of Michigan we'd like to offer you a new job

168
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
I would say thanks

169
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,839
That's exciting

170
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,887
I'm using this new service

171
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
This

172
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
Third person is going to contact you with my questions

173
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,871
It is it is it weird to think about actually saying that to someone offering you a job is weird

174
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
So weird right

175
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,199
Abby thinks that having this intermediary

176
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
Negotiate for you

177
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,551
Could be a huge benefit over the course of your

178
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
First of all

179
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,439
It would be this person's job to study your field and to know what your worth

180
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,767
And this takes a little Advantage away from your employer

181
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Secondly

182
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,399
She says there's research showing that if you make less at the beginning of your career

183
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
You're going to make less down the road

184
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,031
Enter the sooner you bring someone in to negotiate a great salary

185
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
The better that is going

186
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
Also Abby says

187
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,711
This intermediary could help deal with some of the things that add to the gender pay Gap

188
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,575
Well it's clear that two things happen when is that women don't quite ask for

189
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,719
The same things that men will ask for in a negotiation but there's also evidence that when women ask

190
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,279
It's not received the same way as when men ask

191
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
Can an intermediary

192
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
Helps to fix that a little bit

193
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,215
LivingSocial it just kind of jams the signal a little bit

194
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,311
If we're going to name this new profession dude you have an idea like what we call this

195
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,967
Negotiator I think is maybe better than agent in terms of just capturing more what's going on

196
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
It's good talking to ghosts

197
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,855
You know I could do that has a neutral party but I'm not sure these people really going to be neutral

198
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
Mediaries accurate but also kind of bland

199
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
Yeah so

200
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
Yeah like negotiators good I like negotiate

201
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
I'm not in marketing

202
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
Everyone needs a negotiator

203
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,447
Lyle Lovett negotiator also a 1998 movie

204
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Starring

205
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
Samuel L Jackson

206
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
What happened

207
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,895
Negotiates by what are you I don't know

208
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,975
Kenny has left the studio we assumed to go watch

209
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,559
The Negotiator the 1998 movie by Samuel Jackson

210
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
I'm in the studio now is

211
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
Sarah Gonzalez hey Sarah

212
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Your tweets

213
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
Is about the wedding Industrial

214
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
And we gave you this assignment

215
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:15,871
Because you're about to get married congratulation comes from

216
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,199
Damon Jones he's an economist at the University of Chicago

217
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,271
And Demon you're planning wedding right now right

218
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,831
I just recently was married in

219
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
You just oh so you're out you're in the clear I am in the clear but I do have to write thank you notes

220
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,327
Are you behind schedule you have up to a year

221
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
To send out thank-you notes

222
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
Yeah who makes these rules

223
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
And that the time from

224
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
From the wedding gods

225
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
I don't know that I would call them the Gods

226
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
It would be like the wedding Gremlins

227
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,687
Damon's tweaked has to do with the way we think about wedding

228
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Register

229
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
I hate weddings

230
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,111
Everyone hates them it feels like this sideways way of asking people to

231
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
Reimburse you for like

232
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Their dinner in their boobs

233
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:07,583
Yeah and Demon also says that you can't even ask for what you really want on a wedding registry because it's

234
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
A little tacky

235
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
There's some gifts that are not acceptable to ask

236
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,495
For you know can you give me season tickets to the Knicks

237
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,799
But for some reason plates

238
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Enforcer acceptable

239
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,175
We have enough plates we have enough Forks we don't need any more of those

240
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
I feel him here on the forks and plates

241
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:30,623
Maybe that made sense when those things were handmade in Pennsylvania but like this stuff is getting cheaper

242
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,719
And cheaper and throwing a wedding is getting more and more

243
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Expensive

244
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
So here is Damon

245
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
I say

246
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
Let's discard the registry

247
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
And maybe just have some Tikka

248
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Good old-fashioned tickets for the wedding

249
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Weights

250
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
Sell people tickets

251
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
To attend your wedding

252
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
Okay we wouldn't use the word cell

253
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
Well that might be

254
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Not popular

255
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,503
Instead of a wedding registry so like don't buy me a gift

256
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,319
Just pay for your plate of food at the wedding

257
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,415
Don't buy a gift just help us to

258
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,951
To have the best wedding

259
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
Now you want to use the right turn gif

260
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,095
You may want to charge different prices

261
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
Okay so no

262
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
Different prices for different people

263
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
Okay so a flat prices

264
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
Easiest but it's not fair

265
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:25,151
Like maybe you want to cut your undergrad College cousin a break

266
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
But your investment banker friend

267
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
She's paying full price

268
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
This guy is

269
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Hold

270
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,831
And calculating and I kind of like it

271
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
But

272
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
Here Maps

273
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
You have plus one

274
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,767
Okay this is the are the worst

275
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,583
Yes yes

276
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,239
You have a really good friend that you want to invite to your wedding but they have a new boyfriend or girlfriend

277
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,311
And that you don't know

278
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
And now you have to spend like

279
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
About 300 person

280
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
For their food their booze there

281
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,271
Chair their table their Fork

282
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Yeah and

283
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,111
If you have to pay for your new girlfriend's ticket

284
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:12,511
Maybe she doesn't have to come after all and there's another big benefit

285
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
No shows

286
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,863
Can you believe that you're going to go through this entire process

287
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,447
And only to have someone maybe not show up

288
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,751
Okay so I understand that it's a risk

289
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,335
Yeah so why not share the risk

290
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,711
You have a deposit that's none refundable on your ticket and if you decide not to show

291
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,367
We understand and we also appreciate that to your deposit is going toward the food that's going to be sitting there

292
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
Cold and I need

293
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
At the wedding

294
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
Okay so Sarah you are getting married in

295
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
About a month

296
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
Are you going to take

297
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Damon suggestion

298
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
And charge

299
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,703
For entry to your wedding even asking people to give me

300
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,031
But I am going to go on the record right now

301
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
I just say this publicly

302
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,127
If anyone RSVP to my wedding

303
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,247
And fails at the last moment like that is not cool we are not going to be okay

304
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
At least tell me

305
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:12,671
Two or three days before so I can let all the Avengers know Sarah thank you so much mazel tov

306
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,999
And when you're out there can you get Kenny

308
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583

A modest proposal to make baseball more in

313

People often think annuities are too conservative

314
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
Too complex or only for retirees

315
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,295
But annuities can be a smart way to

316
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Two-head marquetry

317
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,367

I'm just kidding

337
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,623
Just tell me the plot of The Negotiator how was it

338
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
I Saw the Light

339
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
But anyway

340
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
Our actual final two

341
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Is about

342
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Baseball

343
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,815
It is also probably or most country

344
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:28,447
Yes Major League Baseball knows that it's games are a little too long

345
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,495
And so they've been trying their own tweaks

346
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
To speed up the game

347
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Little things like

348
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:36,383
Limiting the number of warmup pitches making the commercial breaks between

349
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
Queen Innings shorter

350
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
That's all fine but if they

351
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
Really wanted to Speed the game up

352
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,831
They would be a little more serious about listening to tweet

353
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Proposed by this man

354
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,719
My name is Steven Brams I'm a professor of politics at New York University

355
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
You like baseball

356
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
I'm a fan

357
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
But not a rabid fan

358
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,911
Nope not one who's willing to blindly follow all the rules

359
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Expose

360
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,495
No I suppose some reforms

361
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
Steve and some colleagues have proposed

362
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
What is now known as

363
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
The catch up

364
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,455
Yeah like guy you want ketchup or mustard on that guy that's not that kind

365
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
This is the kind where if you are losing

366
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
You would like to catch

367
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Steve

368
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
Can you give us

369
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,671
The simplest explanation of the catch-up rule

370
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:28,351
In baseball at works as follows that if you're the team ahead in an inning and you're at bat

371
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
Then you get

372
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,447
Only two outs rather than 3 oz

373
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
In that inning

374
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
In other words when you are ahead

375
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
You get fewer chances

376
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,871
The score your opponent who is losing

377
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Get more

378
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
Steve and a colleague

379
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
Tested this out

380
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
Using historic baseball

381
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
We looked at the

382
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,599
100000 games

383
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
100000

384
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
We went back

385
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
Spectra 1967

386
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
50 years

387
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,023
And we analyzed

388
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Each pitch

389
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,655
Are over a hundred thousand games and asked if the ketchup bro I've been in place

390
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
How would things have changed

391
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
As an impatient baseball fan

392
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
How much

393
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,151
Shorter with these games have been the average game which now last 3 hours and 5 minutes

394
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:18,527
Would be caught by 24 minutes OU cutting almost a half an hour from the game and that's one of the biggest

395
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
The game yes

396
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
And not only where the games

397
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Shorter

398
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
They were way more competitive

399
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,487
Which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with its de

400
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Declining a

401
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
So

402
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
How

403
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
Have

404
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Fans

405
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
Reacted

406
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
Teeny tiny toys

407
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
To America's past

408
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,567
Well critically I would say

409
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,895
Let's just say there have been a lot of anger

410
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,967
But Steve is not here to win

411
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
A popularity

412
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
In fact

413
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
He tells us

414
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,855
He's also got a version of the catch up rule

415
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
4 Americas

416
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
Actual favorite sport

417
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Football

418
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,767
In the NFL we would

419
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,863
Give the winning team only $3 rather than $4 to make a first down

420
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,191
Steve you were like you're blowing up every single sport

421
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
Oh yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would

422
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,871
Instead of giving the team ahead 24 seconds to shoot leave the money

423
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
18 seconds at the end of a game

424
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
Oh my God

425
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
You are a true iconoclast

426
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Well

427
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319

428
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,671

431
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,423

432
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,823

Illuminate

The only option that leaves

Deschutes

453
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Understand

454
