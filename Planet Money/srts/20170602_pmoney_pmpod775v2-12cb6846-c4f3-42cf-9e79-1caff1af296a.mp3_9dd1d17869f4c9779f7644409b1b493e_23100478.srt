Reporter Marianne McCune

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,864
Just got back from the border of Arkansas

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,400
And Missouri

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,680
I've been there before it is

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,448
Gorgeous

6
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
Really gorgeous

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,008
Field after

8
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,824
Fairfield can look like they go all the way out to the end of the Earth

9
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
It's so beautiful

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,896
But you were not there

11
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
Just lights

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,432
See you were there

13
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,200
Because

14
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,224
There was

15
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,504
A murder

16
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,320
Of a cotton and soybean farmer

17
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:28,928
And this was no random murder wasn't about a drug deal gone bad wasn't a bar fight

18
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,208
What About Love

19
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,048
Was about something people care about a lot in this region

20
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
Weeds

21
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,376
Nasty invasive weed

22
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,424
One weed in particular

23
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
It is called pigweed

24
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,520
Robert this thing isn't ugly

25
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,128
Horrible weed one plant can make more than a million Seas

26
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:52,224
This thing will choke your crops it'll spread to your neighbor's field

27
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,784
People are in a constant battle with

28
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,368
They rip it out of the ground they spread with harsh pesticides

29
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,488
Former technically herbicide herbicides are the kind of pesticide you use to kill weeds

30
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
Endless fight

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,048
With pigweed

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,864
Led to a real world

33
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
So set the scene for

34
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
Okay it's October 27th

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,984
2016

36
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,288
A 55 year old farmer named Mike Wallace

37
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
Make a phone call

38
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
Weird

39
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,712
Three young man his family says he doesn't even know but who works on a farm that Mike has been having a problem with

40
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,808
The argument is about a pesticide that Mike thinks they're spraying

41
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,880
And it's a pesticide that maybe killing their pigweed

42
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,416
But it's also killing Mike's

43
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Crops

44
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,768
To Mike Wallace and the young farmer decide to meet up

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
They get in their trucks

46
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,376
Drive to a County Road between their two field

47
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,216
Sir neutral ground for the both of them talking nobody knows

48
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,544
About what and then the younger man pulled a gun and shoot

49
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
Mike Wallace in the chair

50
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Robert Smith

51
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Amber dermis

52
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,648
Not exactly what happened we pretty much know that or

53
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
Who did it someone has already been charged

54
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Is prime

55
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
The mystery is why

56
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,560
Why would pick weed and pesticide

57
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Turn Neighbors

58
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
So completely against

59
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
I went to Arkansas to find out

60
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,752
Talk to a lot of the friends and family of Mike Wallace

61
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,360
Spend time with the neighbors and ask the same question over and over again

62
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,408
What is going on here

63
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,736
Why would a man get murdered over pesticide Duster

64
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
Money

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Money is it

66
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
Just a quick note

67
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
In this podcast will be using the word pesticides a lot

68
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
Pesticides include herbicides

69
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Twitch kill weeds

70
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
As well as insecticides

71
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Kill box

72
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
It's the broader term

73
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,568

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,528
I am standing on Long dirt and gravel road

84
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,880
Line on either side by greenfield

85
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
Trees

86
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,488
And farm houses in the distance it is

87
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
Flat

88
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
The sky is blue

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Only few white clouds

90
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,680
It is the quietest

91
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
Comus place you can imagine

92
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,568
And this is the spot where Mike Wallace was

93
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
Killed shot and killed

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,248
To really understand how an argument about weeds and pesticides could come to this

95
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
Points

96
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,344
911 call from the road between two farmers fields

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
I started with a visit to Mike Wallace

98
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:17,791
Is family about a half hour drive away I like your Wallace Farm sign it has been sold out shapes of

99
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
What they grow

100
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,119
Corn cotton

101
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,191
Christmas

102
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:29,567
Mike's Auto Care in and they're 33 year old son Bradley are of that Hardy farmer variety

103
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,967
Squinting their eyes against the Sun and wind while they keep their heads up and get their fields planted on their own without my

104
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,551
Well it's hard that we're pushing through it

105
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,671
In their Big Shed every tool is in place every machine well-cared-for

106
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
They just build the shop last year

107
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,559
Bradley designed it so little do we know that he's going to take over it

108
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,119
Beautiful

109
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
We go inside to Karen's office

110
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,751
To talk more about how in the world this war with pigweed

111
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
Led to Mike's

112
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Death

113
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
The office is spare and so orderly

114
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
Just a few Family Photos above her desk

115
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Mike with his

116
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
Square jaw buzz cut

117
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,343
Kennebec Christopher Reeves smile

118
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Delena Fielding

119
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,463
Get it and drag it out to the end I mean he was just not going to leave the pig weight in the field

120
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,767
Mike was not an organic farmer or anything

121
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,863
He also used pesticides kill pigweed like most everyone around here

122
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,239
And in the 90s when the first genetically modified cotton seeds came on the market he planted those two

123
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,311
BOCES were engineered with a genetic trait

124
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,151
That protected them from a very powerful pesticide called

125
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Roundup

126
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
And this was

127
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Huge

128
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
For the First Time The Seas allowed Farmers to

129
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
To spray Roundup all over the cotton

130
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Without killing the cotton itself

131
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,719
Imagine you see some of those pigweed plants invading

132
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,327
You can get out there and spray Roundup all over everything and the pigweed eyes

133
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,887
Well the cotton remains completely healthy

134
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
It was a dream

135
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Hi

136
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,871
Harrison Bradley comes in to talk and their longtime adviser and friend Dave

137
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,711
Pierce and Dave jumps in to try to explain how Roundup

138
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,271
Fits into the confounding story of Mike's

139
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:19,391
Stop Roundup made a lot of people good Farmers he would kill everything in your field

140
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
That didn't have the trade-in

141
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
To protect it

142
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,119
It was a once-in-a-lifetime chemistry I mean we depended on it for years and years and we depended on too much

143
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,191
Too much because after a decade of spraying Roundup

144
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
Pigweed did its own genetic morphine

145
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,359
And became as immune to Roundup as those miraculous soybeans and Cotton Were

146
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Spray as much Roundup if you want

147
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
The penguin

148
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Did not care

149
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
Mother Nature's pretty shower

150
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
There were other pasta

151
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,879
One particularly powerful one cuz I can book

152
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
Still kill pigweed easily

153
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,511
So the big companies that make seeds and pesticides invented

154
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
A news

155
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
One that could survive die camba

156
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Great

157
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
Except for one big problem

158
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,471
It's illegal to spray dye camp on your cotton and soybean

159
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
It's an old pesticide

160
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:12,127
And all pesticides can drift but they camba is especially prone to it

161
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Wherever it lands

162
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
It will kill everything

163
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
Everything that isn't real

164
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,599
The big companies were working on a new version of the spray one that didn't drift

165
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
But it hadn't been approved yet

166
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,487
So the resistance e came out before you could buy the pesticide to go with it

167
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
Karen says her husband saw a right away where this

168
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
Along the way might knew that

169
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,167
Invincible people know that this seed

170
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,543
Could present a problem a problem because the old Zicam but was so tempting

171
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:45,407
The old formulation is cheap to use and I thought it would take care of the weed population and

172
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
Just would go ahead and do it anyway

173
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,295
As soon as those Farmers got their new seeds growing

174
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
Mike saw trouble in his

175
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,743
He could spot a problem pretty pretty rapidly and we knew that you know something wasn't just quite right

176
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
So hang on what it look like

177
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
The plant just curls up

178
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,167
Curls up in the leaves pucker and when it's bad

179
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
The plant dies

180
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,031
So Mike did what he always done in the situation he was

181
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,383
Just wanted to go out and try to talk through problems and Nash I can't believe

182
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
Medicine Bradley says this time it didn't seem to work

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
When Mike went to tell one neighbor

184
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,527
Hey you sprayed me

185
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,599
First time exotic dad went back out and looked and

186
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
Delta Dental

187
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,207
Alpha you can tell by the way he's in his field or dying

188
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
Calling back

189
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Ignited again

190
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,887
So Mike called The Plant Board which is like the pesticide police

191
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,519
And let me just say spraying these kinds of pesticides is a serious Affair you have to have a license

192
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,127
Arkansas universities County offices give yearly refresher courses on the steps

193
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
Keep Farmers up

194
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
The date

195
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,503
I went to what they must have said read the label 15 times

196
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,855
And the label is like seven pages of complicated instructions

197
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
The label tells you when you can spray

198
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,279
What types of crops at what wind speeds even what kind of nozzle to use

199
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,375
What are the University of Arkansas guys I talked to Tom Barber told me if

200
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
Plant board

201
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,703
Suspect you did not follow the rules

202
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,311
They will come swab the tank that holds the pesticides Bell check your nozzle

203
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
Is hard to hide a lot

204
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Oh so there is Avenue

205
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
So there is evidence you can

206
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
You know there's wife

207
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
To figure it out

208
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,063
So they're like we found a camera in your

209
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:28,831
Tank

210
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:33,183
Your crops are cotton there for you used I can loan you weren't suppose

211
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
And then they say so we're taking you to jail

212
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,143
Well I don't know if I took him to jail actually the farmer is called to a hearing usually months later

213
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,215
And if they find he did indeed spray illegally he is

214
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
Find when Mike filed his complaint with

215
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Plant board

216
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,871
They called in a Missouri farmer who's got Fields next to Mike's

217
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,967
His name is on the transcript of the hearing so I drove over to his farm

218
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Hello

219
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,087
The Masters Farm is just a little bit bigger than the Wallace

220
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,159
These are multimillion-dollar operations

221
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,231
But at the same time none of these Farmers look rich to my eyes

222
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
The Masters live in an old house

223
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
With a rickety screen door

224
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,167
They take out huge loans to buy the season the pesticides and

225
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:20,031
Farmers margins are thin and especially these last few years with cotton and soybean prices

226
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,127
I'm a Long Way From Home

227
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:29,503
Some Farm hands tell me Donald Masters at lunch and to watch out for the dogs

228
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Bites

229
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
1 suggest

230
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
Carrying a piece of plastic pipe

231
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,647
When the sun Douglas arrive

232
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
Hi how are you

233
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
I'm good

234
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,559
Is 50's big beard wild hair

235
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
I asked him about

236
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
The plan towards visit to his farm and he says yep

237
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,751
They did figure out that he and his family spray dye Campbell when they weren't supposed to

238
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
If you get dye, you can smell it and taste it

239
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
I do

240
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
Taste like metal

241
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
In your mouth

242
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
You never mixed it

243
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
I haven't

244
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,391
Anyway Douglas said the plant board investigators were too late to actually find that I can buy in their tank

245
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
But they found plenty of other oven

246
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
Yeah everybody got in trouble

247
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,559
And did you know that you weren't supposed to be spraying it

248
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:22,495
You on a mission of y'all don't you actually really want to understand it what I want like is taking us.

249
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:26,591
Economics

250
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
And what what

251
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,943
What did that make you have duck if you would a spray dye camel a

252
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
To get rid of it

253
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
To get rid of these pigweed

254
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Read ahead

255
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,671
How many of them Choppers we can bring in here by the truckload by the bus

256
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:45,791
Shoppers are people with hoes in most cases immigrant laborers who manually pull out the pickle

257
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
Over a hundred and they go bid on Phil's

258
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
They bid on feels to go chop

259
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
And you'll lose money

260
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
I mean

261
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
You lose money

262
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
When they do that

263
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
At this point

264
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,151
Douglas's dad gets back from lunch which they called dinner

265
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:06,527
He's got white hair eyes that look like they've been peering into the Sun for 70-plus years

266
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,647
And when he sees me he pays no attention just climbs up into a huge Red Machine

267
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
I head over

268
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
Can I come up and have to climb up 6

269
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
Steps to reach him

270
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
What is this machine called

271
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
Watch

272
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
What were you in

273
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Tractors

274
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,079
I always want to call everything attractive but I'm never sure if I'm right

275
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
He takes a quick phone call and then we talk

276
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Acme in a buddy seat

277
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,063
You know it's it it look like from the plant board record I saw in Arkansas that you were

278
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,415
Accused of bring that, when you weren't supposed to and

279
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Other place Vine

280
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
And why'd you do that

281
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
While doing

282
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,631
Go I got weed you can't kill it away

283
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,215
Well he could have sprayed some other pesticides but

284
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,031
They were three times as expensive and not the best

285
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,847
And he was with these by cama tolerance

286
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
Donald told me when he bought the seeds

287
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,479
He thought he'd be able to buy the new improved I came and within months

288
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
And that didn't happen he just figured he

289
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,343
She could use the old I can buy without hurting anyone

290
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
It all

291
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,207
I have the machine that didn't drift

292
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:24,607
And what do you say to people who say the law is the law that you got to read the label and and do it like the labels

293
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
Your uncle drive over 60 miles an hour

294
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
Starve 35 La play but I bet you do

295
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
All right I got to work

296
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Duluth

297
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
All right

298
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
So much

299
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,991
The penalty for spraying illegally was not a lot more than a very expensive speeding ticket

300
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
A maximum fine of $1,000

301
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
And that made Mike Wallace and his family

302
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
As mad as anything

303
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,999
Back in their offices wife Karen and Dave Pierce can crunch the numbers in there

304
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:58,399
How much does a thousand dollars matter compared to the savings that people are getting by sprained I can buy

305
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
You dealing with

306
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,007
Multimillion-dollar operations you know I mean just the

307
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Harborside

308
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,919
Alone you know that could be saving 25-30 $40,000

309
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:16,575
So $1,000 didn't really mean that much when they're saving 14 $50,000 they go down in the

310
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Walkaway

311
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:25,023
That first year that the dykema tolerant cotton seeds were out Farmers across Arkansas Missouri and Tennessee

312
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,631
Found their own plant dying because their neighbors were spraying die camba

313
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,935
Mike Wallace did not want

314
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,983
Switch to the new cotton seeds himself

315
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
They were more expensive and he liked what he had

316
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
But Karen says they switched anyway

317
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,407
Even though they still couldn't spray that I can buy pesos

318
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,247
We felt like we had to protect ourselves we plan it all

319
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,855
That can't be cotton just to keep from having the drift on it and the damage

320
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,975
But the following year another genetically-modified seed came out this time of soybean seed

321
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
I could survive die camba

322
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,863
So now they're words I can't be tolerant cotton and soybeans on the market

323
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:05,471
But still no updated and legal version of dye canvas spray to go along

324
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,799
Tom Barber says his phone started ringing off

325
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,359
Off the hook about cupping and curling leaves

326
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,991
They started calling in June and we started getting pictures of da Gama symptoms on sensitive celebrities

327
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:22,111
And what kind of level damage were you seeing results of ear and we saw

328
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Minimal

329
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,487
I may not do you know if you would mean like 50% of somebody's crops or something

330
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Ride

331
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
What yeah

332
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Mike was pissed

333
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
2

334
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,471
He'd switch to dicamba resistant cotton

335
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,775
But now he's soybeans for dying

336
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,383
There were so many complaints of damage from drift that summer of 2016 that the

337
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
The federal government stepped in to investigate

338
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
More than 100 thousand acres damage

339
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
Millions of dollars

340
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,111
And Mike Wallace was speaking out

341
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,927
He was pushing the state to raise fine

342
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
You've been talking about mounting a lawsuit

343
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
Suit against his neighbors

344
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
He was quoted in the Wall Street Journal

345
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,911
Makes complaints that summer had gotten another big farmer into trouble with

346
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
What the plant board

347
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:13,055
Documents show the farmer was contesting it refusing to give over his pesticide records

348
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
And carrots is the farmer called Mike

349
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Point upset

350
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,503
And then one day months later for reasons Mike's family members say they cannot figure out

351
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,599
Mike got a phone number for a young employee of that farm

352
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
I called him

353
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,671
As crop year was over

354
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,255
Our Harvest was done he was he was moving dirt

355
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
And you know just

356
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
From hearing

357
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:38,143
What others have said you know there was a conversation between me and my husband

358
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
And Mack

359
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,007
Just want to talk to him about it that day a little before 5 on a

360
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
October 27th

361
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:47,359
The two men drove their cars to that quiet County Road

362
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Between the two Farms

363
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Got out

364
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Started to talk

365
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
Farmers always have

366
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
And things

367
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Got out of control

368
00:16:54,783 --> 00:17:00,927
We have continuing coverage tonight after a man in Mississippi county was arrested after reportedly shoe

369
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,511
And killing another man Mike was unarmed

370
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,095
The other man was a 26 year old named Alan Curtis Jones

371
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,423
There was one witness Jones's cousin had come along

372
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
And according to the Sheriff's press release

373
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
Mike Wallace grabbed

374
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
Curtis Jones by the arm

375
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
Jones pull away from him

376
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Drew his gun

377
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
And quote

378
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
Shot Wallace until the gun with

379
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,295
According to sheriff Dale cook the shooting happened after the two got into an argument

380
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
Preliminary information it was

381
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
About this doc hammer drill

382
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
The sheriff's press release says the cousin Presta shirt onto one of Mike's wounds and told Jones to call 911

383
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:44,703
The 911 call log says Jones told the operator that he shot Mike in the chest

384
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,495
After Mike had quote attack

385
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,567
By the time police arrived Mike was dead

386
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,407
There is a lot that remains a mystery

387
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,503
Like why did Mike call Curtis Jones and what did they say

388
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Harvest

389
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Is over

390
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:04,671
Over in arbyrd Missouri where Curtis Jones is from people can't believe it happened

391
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,511
Farmers like Donald Masters that guy I met on a big red tractor

392
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
He says he watched Jones grow up

393
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
Oh

394
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,935
Well I don't know the boy shot him in the guy that got shot

395
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,495
They said cars were just scared

396
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
I can't believe you get those

397
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
Buddy Charters had a gun

398
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
Mike Mitchell

399
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Have you seen him since

400
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Yeah

401
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,599
Curtis Jones got out on bond the same night at the shooting

402
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
I like everyone else I talked to you was still confused about how a fight over drifting pesticides could lead one

403
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
Farmer to kill another

404
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
I did go by the place Curtis Jones work

405
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
Mileage to from the master

406
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Walked in

407
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,239
And there he was sitting behind the counter

408
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
I've seen lots of photos of

409
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
Hi my name is Mary and I'm looking

410
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Curtis Jones

411
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
But when I said I was there to talk to

412
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
The Curtis Jones

413
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
Curtis Jones said

414
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
He wasn't there

415
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,575
Okay

416
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Sure

417
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,487
We go back to Mike Wallace Farm after this short break

418
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,839
Support for Planet Money and the following message come from ishares

419
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,655
Because the best preparation for tomorrow

420
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,215
Is building for your future today

421
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,007
Ishares by BlackRock

422
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
Inspired to build

423
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,151
There are a lot of ways to think about why Mike Wallace died

424
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,015
You can certainly fault Curtis Jones at the very least for pulling a gun on an unarmed man

425
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,855
Some fault the state for not regulating all this more effective

426
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,439
Arkansas is now raising the fines for illegal spraying

427
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,999
A lot of people including the wallaces

428
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
Are furious at

429
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,583
Company that put out that camera tolerance

430
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Seeds

431
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,423
Without being able to sell the new spray to go with it

432
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
That company is Monsanto

433
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
And they say

434
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,567
The new seed had a lot of benefits even without the right path

435
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,591
How to cite a spray on it

436
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
And they wanted to get into Farmers hands fast

437
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,687
Possible so they could work with

438
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
They also told Farmers not

439
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
To use the old I can buy

440
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
Monsanto is now

441
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,183
Prove to sell an updated version of Zicam at that is less likely to drift

442
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,255
So it's three times as expensive as the old one

443
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,815
And it's still restricted during growing season in Oregon

444
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
I don't blame Monsanto

445
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
I mean.

446
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
Tumi

447
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,215
That Tom Barber the researcher from University of Arkansas

448
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
You know that's almost blaming

449
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
A gun manufacturer for

450
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
Making the gun

451
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
You know I

452
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
You know people make decisions

453
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:37,247
One thing that people seem to agree on is that there is a hunger for

454
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
He's

455
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,367
Bees that farmers experienced during those magic years of Roundup Ready

456
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
When the pigweed could be conch

457
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,511
Barbara says people are hoping this new died, technology would be it

458
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
I wanted to believe that he was going to be as easy

459
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
As a Roundup

460
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Which is not

461
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,215
But at night they wanted to believe it was going to be that easy

462
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,055
Barbara is pretty convinced it's never going to be that easy

463
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:07,199
Because as soon as everyone goes with this new Dai camera technology pigweed will play that trick

464
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
Mother Nature

465
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271
You know we have a history

466
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
Of just

467
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,879
Hitting the next herbicide using it for 3 or 4 years

468
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,416
And then we can resist

469
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,768
I mean it's just makes sense if you just rely on one and one alone

470
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,816
You're going to develop resistant

471
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:28,192
Back at the Wallace Farm Karen and Bradley are waiting for a rain to pass so they can get

472
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
Cotton in the ground

473
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Without mic

474
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:35,872
Karen Wallace says more than a thousand people showed up for her husband funeral at their Church

475
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,200
We want to tractors around the cemetery and there was probably

476
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,272
5220 tractors the people got there quick

477
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:49,184
He was very very good gif

478
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,768
Not everyone agreed with Mike Wallace

479
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,792
Some didn't like his

480
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072
Finger pointing

481
00:21:55,584 --> 00:22:00,448
But his friends and family saw him as a man who deeply believed Farmers should be in it together

482
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,008
But if someone needed help digging a ditch

483
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
Michael be there

484
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Someone got

485
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,080
Sick during Harvest

486
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,872
He be out there harvesting for them

487
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,944
You know it'd be a perfect world we could all get along

488
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
But it's not

489
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
Enough

490
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
I just hope it to

491
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
Tumescence

492
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
Generation

493
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,672
Bedtime

494
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,768
That we can strive for that and dad that we can

495
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,072
Work together for the

496
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
The greater good

497
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
It all

498
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,424
And now you know I just helped

499
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Is that group of young men

500
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
Can carry on this Legacy

501
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,080
The young man who shot Mike Wallace

502
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
Goes on trial later this year

503
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,920
He pleaded not guilty to First

504
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
Degree murder

505
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:55,488

This season they're asking this

Did question

517
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
How is it that

518
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
Two people look at the exact same thing

519
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
And see something completely different

520
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:35,168

Robert Smith

524
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Why are you here

525
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,672
I work over money guess what

526
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,952
I work for a show called

527
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
Planet Money

528
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:03,072
So that is absolutely why I'm here

529
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,864
I wasn't pretending I wasn't
