Here is kind of money we work in and open

8
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:24,064
If I turn my chair around I can see the entire team

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,112
And even if I don't turn my chair around

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:26,880
I can hear it

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:32,000
So that the marginal cost is so different

12
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,536
I said between

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,120
David kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein and they are bickering

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,192
All day long it's like there a married couple who

15
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,984
You're not really sure if they're going to make it

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,848
No I know when I first started a Planet Money on my first day they got into a fight about

17
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,872
Keynesian economics

18
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
An actual fight

19
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,944
And I remember sitting there thinking

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,224
Number one I need to

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,248
To read up on Candida

22
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,272
Economics right now

23
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
And number two

24
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,856
I'm never going to be able to get any work done in this off

25
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:02,208
It's too loud I can't even hear my own thoughts I can just hear Jacob

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,256
Robert has some really loud

27
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,024
Thoughts to

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,656
It was literally that's white exist

29
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,960
And then there is Noel Kings laugh

30
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,800
Love that laugh

31
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,080
I know it's a pretty girl

32
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
But it is hard to get work done with all of this noise app

33
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,504
This is the world that most of us are working in

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,832
70% of us work in some kind of open Office setup

35
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
I will be honest right here

36
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
Sometimes

37
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
I just

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
Dream of having

39
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
Adore

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
With walls

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
The go all the way around

42
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
Hello and welcome

43
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,472

45
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Who gave us the

46
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Hell

47
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
That is the open on

48
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,224
Oh come on it's pretty nice you have a nice office

49
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,576
Also we have the inside story of one of the first open offices

50
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
And all the drama that ensued

51
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
Just a heads up

52
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,256

So before we get into the story of the OpenOffice

69
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,936
I'll introduce you to one of the people who ended up working there

70
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
His name is Paul Spencer and he works an adverb

71
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,056
Juvenis campaigns that are really proud of

72
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:58,432
The one I most famous for and I'm still coasting on decades later

73
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,968
Is for the New York Lotto

74
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
Hey you never know

75
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
That was that was

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
No way

77
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
Wow

78
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
You probably sold a lottery

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
I know

80
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,256
Back in 1994 Paul was just starting out in his career

81
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
He was freelancing

82
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
And he got a call from chayet day

83
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
It was like the hottest

84
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
Ad Agency in New York

85
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
Shiet was

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
The prestigious place you know

87
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
You were really creative

88
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,568
If you were there and you wanted to be able to say I was a shy

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Yeah

90
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
No big deal

91
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
Yeah you know no big deal they just

92
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Baby Energizer

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Funny famous animated

94
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
Super Bowl ads

95
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
No big deal just like the most creative people you can put in a room in New York advertising at the time that was

96
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,232
And at the time Paul got the call

97
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,304
All New York was buzzing about china's new office

98
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
As The Story Goes

99
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
The CEO of Sade

100
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
Jay Shetty

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Had a vision

102
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
On the ski slopes

103
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,264
Italia right as one does as one does

104
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
Of a totally new works

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,128
So we hired the super famous

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
The Builder poem

107
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
His name

108
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
Gaetano Pesce

109
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
It's outpatient battalion

110
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
From Venice

111
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
I am 76

112
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
When they work on day

113
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
Female creativity

114
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,256
This is the man who stole my joy

115
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
Depressed

116
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,399
For what turned out to be such a big moment in office history

117
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,215
The instructions that Josh I gave Gaetano

118
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
They were pretty vague

119
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,103
What did he say when he came to you without people

120
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,431
An office without paper

121
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
Super sounds kind of Monday

122
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
But if you think about it

123
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
This was prefer

124
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
I mean most of the things

125
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
We think of as being associated with an office

126
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Are essentially paper management

127
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,767
Staplers hole punches file folders

128
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
File cabinets

129
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
Even desks

130
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,143
Pretty much just there to hold paper

131
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,935
But this was 1990

132
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,727
Didn't really need

133
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
People that much anymore

134
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Are laptops

135
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Service email

136
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
The office

137
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
It was kind of just a hold over

138
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
From a more primitive time

139
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
And you guys they were trying to reinvent off

140
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
Start anew

141
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,295
She was given a blank

142
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,879
The entire floor of a skyscraper in lower Manhattan

143
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
29000 square feet

144
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
Sophie went down to check it out

145
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
Yes I remember was in the evening

146
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
This place was wrong

147
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Empty

148
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,911
With bulbs attached to the ceiling

149
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
What did you think when you thought

150
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
Because you don't need

151
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
The office

152
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
You don't

153
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
Need the author

154
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,479
Gaetano Pesce started sketching out designs for this new office

155
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
The likes of which the world has never seen

156
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,599
It looks like a giant living room

157
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
Jose open space

158
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
VT Lottery

159
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
Kona results

160
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
Sulfur

161
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Comfortable chair

162
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
Weed coffee shop

163
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,447
Because I think people when they meet so they like to have a drink they like to eat

164
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
This was Radical

165
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,031
At the time remember it's 1994

166
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
The typical workplace was all about

167
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
Cubicles everything was uniform everything was

168
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,175
Efficient they were neutral colors

169
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
I got tunnel was going to build

170
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
A big living

171
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
With a copy shop

172
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
There was also a ping pong table a giant steer

173
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Nowhere

174
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
And PS Teresa stones

175
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
The floor

176
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Poured plastic resin

177
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,535
And not beige or white or

178
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Any normal color

179
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
It was the color of a

180
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
Tangerine

181
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
With all these red yellow and

182
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
Who designs

183
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
Like arrows

184
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Oops

185
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
And words

186
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,543
Chord by Gaetano himself

187
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,359
Who had to walk around with special spiky shoes while it was dry

188
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
The way he tells it

189
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
His inspiration was

190
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
Pretty much whatever he was thinking about that day

191
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
I remember Nocona one day

192
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
When I was doing the floor

193
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,623
I8

194
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,671
I was thinking Benny's

195
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Hey put the arrow

196
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
On the floor

197
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
Hadley and they right

198
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Vanish because that for

199
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Did the election of Venice

200
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
You know East

201
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
The desks in his office

202
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,567
Cuz we're all on Wheels and the chairs were plastic

203
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
With coil springs

204
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
4likes

205
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
Critics

206
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,175
Crazy over this new off

207
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
Here's a quote from the New York Times

208
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
Men's magazine it said

209
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,111
The workers seem to be traveling through some new improved dimension

210
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,183
These young Gap guard HotShots go

211
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
Breathing by

212
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
The paste

213
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Bestride

214
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
The circle

215
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
Gesticulating with one hand clutching

216
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
Cellular phone

217
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
In the other

218
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
Or they briefly touchdown attic

219
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,007
Computer console one of a cluster of free-floating Workstation

220
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,311
They can be wheeled around the floor

221
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
To take advantage

222
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Of the spectacular Skyline View

223
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
Thumbs up

224
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
Really long-winded for thumbs up

225
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Thumbs up

226
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,599
So many people wanted to see the office showed they started arranging tours

227
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,183
This is the office that Paul Spencer walked into on his

228
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
First day

229
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
That was the guy you heard from the beginning with just taking this

230
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
Exciting new job

231
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
His dream job

232
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,143
And when you showed up he was almost as excited to see the office

233
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
As he was to start working

234
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
The elevator took him up

235
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
To the 38th floor

236
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
And he walked into the office

237
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,639
You know I just remember a lot of orange and

238
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
Taupe colors in

239
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,223
There was a design like

240
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,039
Drawings and paintings built into the

241
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Floor

242
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
It was like there were

243
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
Kind of rubbery code over at

244
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:31,487
And it felt good I remember thinking wow this is great this is so beautiful

245
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
Carrie was at one of the most

246
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,143
Creative places to work in advertising and in the most creative office space he ever seen

247
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
This was not a bland cubicle Farm

248
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
This was inspiring

249
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
Power walks up the reception

250
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
They had this

251
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Cool sister

252
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,383
Where you would check out a laptop and a cell phone for the day

253
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,455
And the laptops and cell phones were kept in these lockers

254
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
It looks pretty cool they looked like they were out of a movie

255
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,599
You know like a police drama where there like unlocking

256
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
Metal cages in giving you your

257
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,487
38 revolver whatever it was like while I'm

258
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
Going into creative battle

259
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
Pump it up with this guy he was going to partner with

260
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
Is art director named Mike

261
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,983
And he said hey Mike it's so nice to meet you this place is amazing

262
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,079
Just kind of like shrugs and rolls his eyes

263
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
And you were like

264
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
I wonder why I mean

265
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
So beautiful

266
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
Paul starts his first day at work

267
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:29,087
And a few hours later he and Mike the art director are sitting in Gaetano Pesce

268
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,903
Caffe batting around ideas for an ad for

269
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
Telephone company

270
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
Imposters to have this

271
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
Weird feeling

272
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
It was kind of like

273
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,375
Late in the day looking across the table in the

274
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
The kitchen at Mike

275
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
Oh there's a problem

276
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
This place is kind of

277
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
Scorching my brain

278
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
It's like Ike

279
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Focus

280
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
Everything was

281
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,943
Too bright too loud

282
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,223
To open

283
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
And Paul was not the only one having a bad reaction

284
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Into the office

285
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,623
Shalom Auslander was a creative director at shayetet

286
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
Sitting inside of a migraine

287
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,047
I guess you to climb inside a migraine headache

288
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
That's what that felt like

289
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
It wasn't just the bright colors and the plastic

290
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,215
For although he did say that the floor had this weird smell the game

291
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
Headaches

292
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
Shalom says the real problem was the open

293
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
Extreme open

294
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,919
That's right cuz once you got your laptop and your cell phone

295
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,479
You had no idea where to go

296
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,807
For me it was a very unmoored on the feeling

297
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
So you spend a lot of time I walked away

298
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
I walked a lot

299
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
Cuz I was constantly walking

300
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
Around and around

301
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
You know had to deceive John yet he is

302
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,935
In that room or isn't that room or detention until he just left to that room

303
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,519
I'm passing other people who were walking around

304
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
The other direction

305
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
And all the stuff

306
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
Personal stuffs

307
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
Set the old style of office hat

308
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Contain

309
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
It all came spilling out in this big

310
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Openstack

311
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,855
The saddest element of it is that you see somebody with a

312
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
Phone

313
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
Or human being

314
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
Internist awful plastic nurse

315
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,839
With a phone press to their ear and clearly something was going on are getting divorced

316
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Somebody

317
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:21,471
Somebody was die something human was happening on the other end of that phone

318
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,799
And they're just walking around and then other saying is hang on

319
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,383
Help me find a planet

320
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,455
Hey Jim Hayden Hayden

321
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,575
And just like desperately and going into some dark corner somewhere and

322
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,879
Iran

323
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Trying to have

324
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Interaction

325
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
Which was an actual human being

326
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
Shalom says he just

327
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
Couldn't get any work

328
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
Did you like coping mechanisms

329
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,399
Yeah it's called my house

330
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
That would go to my house which did not have plastic floors

331
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Or hives or not

332
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,639
Work trannies or whatever they called it

333
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,967
I would just go home and sit my ordinary kitchen table and

334
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
Have an ordinary martini and

335
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
Figure out

336
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
Commercial for whatever and

337
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,647
And go back the next day and act like I've been there

338
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
Paul Spencer told me he started to

339
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
Hate the open Office

340
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
And he felt really bad about

341
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
He felt like maybe

342
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
He wasn't cool enough or maybe somehow he was

343
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Failing

344
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,727
It's like this whole thing was a big big

345
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
To figure out

346
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
What would happen if

347
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,591
Free people from cubicles from their cages

348
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,431
What potential can be realized when you let people run free

349
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,479
It turns out people realized

350
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
They just

351
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
Really wanted

352
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Walls

353
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
Paul says he would walk into the office

354
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
Is looking for his colleagues

355
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,951
Any find them in the few places with doors

356
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
With walls

357
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
The conference room

358
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:52,863
Clearly there was like tribal happenings going on there where people had like

359
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
Camped out in

360
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,495
Like oil conference rooms that were supposed to be just

361
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,383
Temporary he would come in and he taking them over

362
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
They like

363
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
Cobra Corner in them

364
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
We're in here

365
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,551
And it was like all about kind of getting in and

366
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
Getting your corner early

367
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
You felt like you were part of somebody's

368
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,951
Idea of how people work

369
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Supposed to be

370
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
But we're not really that way

371
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,607
The architect of this space Gaetano Pesce would drop by to

372
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
To visit his

373
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Creation

374
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
And he told me yes

375
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
He did hear this complaint

376
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
That the OpenOffice thing was just

377
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Not working

378
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Looking for some people

379
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,127
Does that make you feel bad

380
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
New things

381
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Bother

382
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
At the beginning

383
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
When you make something you

384
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
First of the actually is I don't like

385
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
I mean do you think the OpenOffice

386
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
Went too far

387
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
No no there is never too far

388
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:56,095
I mean what would you say to somebody who said I worked in this office and

389
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:59,679
Like it was beautiful but I couldn't get any work done

390
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
Evita understand

391
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
The possibility

392
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
The creativity

393
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
Gaetano said he's heard from a lot of people

394
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
People who love this

395
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
And also

396
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
For what it's worth

397
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
These did turn out to be some of the most creative years

398
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
Forsyth Tech

399
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
They came up with a famous

400
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
Apple think different campaign

401
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
With the Taco Bell Chihuahua yo quiero Taco Bell that one and other companies look at Cheyenne days off

402
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
Space and they said

403
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
I want

404
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
The OpenOffice seemed exciting it was cool

405
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
People could communicate and collaborate really easily

406
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,567
And Adam plus it was cheaper you can fit more people into a smaller space

407
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Save on rent

408
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Innuendo

409
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Wish I had a OpenOffice experiment

410
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Was short-lived

411
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,503
It was doing so well it got bought out by another cop

412
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
A much bigger company

413
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,135
That moved them out of this office and into a much more traditional

414
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,487
Just a few years after they moved into this crazy new open Office

415
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
They moved out

416
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
Gaetano's creation was dismantled

417
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
Architecture critics started calling it a failure

418
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
A good idea taking too far

419
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,751
But the office didn't die in tirely

420
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,079
In fact Gaetano Pesce started seeing pieces of it all over the

421
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
He's not one of the Rolling desks

422
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
In Milan

423
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
A plastic chair in Paris

424
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
A piece of a wall panel in Aspen

425
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
The elf evoxac

426
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,319
Loaded around the world

427
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,903
It really was an open Office

428
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,231
Shalom Auslander and Paul Spencer both eventually left

429
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
But he said everywhere they went

430
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Is office follow.

431
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
I followed all of us

432
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,703
If you look at pictures of the old child day and you look at pictures

433
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,287
Of Google or Facebook or the NPR headquarters in DC

434
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,359
They look the same the OpenOffice in some form

435
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Is everywhere

436
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Is interstate

437
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,479
When I die I am going to hell and it is

438
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
They've definitely gone

439
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Over the open space

440
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,951
So Nick I have been working in this office with you guys for almost 2 years

441
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:03,583
And even though I had my doubts in the beginning have to say there are some things that I really like about it

442
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,143
I feel like my ideas get a lot better X where we

443
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
Batting around all the time

444
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:13,311
And I feel like I laugh a lot more than I did when I was working in a room by myself think I'm actually happier

445
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
Yeah I feel like

446
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,919
This is the most collaborative and funny place I've ever

447
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
And I think

448
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
For all of us

449
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
There's a larger just

450
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Human Experience

451
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
Which is that as human beings

452
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,415
We crave human interaction

453
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
We like to be around other humans

454
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Yes that's true

455
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
All of those things are true

456
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
And

457
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:41,727
Sometimes I just want you guys to tell you what I had a piece of chicken

458
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
So I went to hell and hearty

459
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,527
