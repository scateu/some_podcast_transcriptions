1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,816
1 things I love about the phrase

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:03,840
Trade War

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,120
Is it sounds

4
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,144
So dramatic

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,912
Council

6
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,680
Viola

7
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:11,520
But at the same time a trade wars fought using these incredibly boring weapon

8
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,592
Percentages and lists

9
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,640
Spreadsheets

10
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,992
I am in the Excel spreadsheet trenches absolutely

11
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,808
This is Chad Bown a trade Economist with a Peterson in

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,112
And like ask your Planet Money

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,160
He's been pouring over these lists

14
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
Products that

15
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,952
The United States in

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
In China

17
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,512
Have been slapping new tariffs on

18
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,304
It started with President Trump's berries

19
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
Shortlist

20
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,632
A new set of tariffs on Chinese steel and

21
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,960
Lendup hitting about 3 billion dollars worth of

22
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:47,872
Chinese exports of Steel and aluminum to the u.s. owe China came up with a list of three billion dollars worth of imports from United

23
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
Red states to retaliate over

24
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:54,272
President Trump then the next day said well we're going to hit you with 50 billion dollars worth of

25
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,808
Tariffs on other products

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
China

27
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,624
Responded by saying okay well here's our

28
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,904
50 billion dollar product

29
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,696
And what makes the list

30
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,256
And doesn't make the list is a sort of international game

31
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,560
As a trade Economist Chad noticed that

32
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
China's list of new tariffs

33
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,168
We're filled with an awful lot of agricultural products

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728
There are a lot of food products

35
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
I need less sleep make you hungry doesn't it

36
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,104
It really does and this is primarily because a lot of what

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
America sells to China

38
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
Is food

39
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
I know so many nuts

40
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,992
NN fruits

41
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
And

42
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
And pork

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,624
There's really something there for everyone regardless of your culinary tastes

44
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,744
Is there any way that you could cook a delicious meal made up of China's retaliate

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,608
We could start off with a refreshing smoothie

46
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,704
A lot of fruit on the on the list things like apples and pineapples

47
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
We could add a little bit of

48
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
Ginseng and maybe some coconut

49
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
And

50
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
We can actually make it with almond milk so there's not an actual dairy products on there but we could use almond milk as sort of

51
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
The base I will note that on this list

52
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
Stirrups is

53
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,416
Sparkling wine so we can have a nice little cocktail hour he won't go thirsty

54
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
I'm for the main dish

55
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,584
You did you're probably going to build around if you're thinking about meat is is a busy Port Friday

56
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,656
Sure lots of Chinese tariffs on American

57
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
I either ham or

58
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,056
Pate maybe dice up some hazelnuts pistachios and and

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Set up that way

60
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
Another weird

61
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,712
Just joking here there is a real

62
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,320
Affect all these American Products in this fantasy meal are now subject to

63
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Tariff

64
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,648
Which means they are 15 to 25% more

65
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
Expensive for the Chinese consumer

66
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
Which means China will buy less

67
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
Which means we might have a surplus of these products

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
Here

69
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,632
And we might just want to get

70
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
Used to smoothies and pork pate

71
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,288
Planet Money I'm Robert Smith

Aluminum

75
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,296
Chef American scrap aluminum just got hit with a 25% Chinese tariff

76
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,416
Yes. Planet Money reporters open up the scrumptious list of retaliation

77
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,976
And find some surprising stories inside

78
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
Hope you saved room for durian ice cream

As many of you know I am a father

91
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
And one of the rules of being a

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Is if you want to punish

93
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Your child

94
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,760
What you do with you find the things they love the most

95
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:12,160
My God why did you take it away from them know this is how you punish children

96
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
And mostly the iPhone

97
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,280
Is mostly the iPhone

98
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,351
But in the case of retaliatory tariff

99
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
I feel like

100
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
China took a look

101
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
The United States

102
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
Ghetto what do they love

103
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
The most

104
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
Or more accurately what do they love to

105
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
To export

106
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
The most

107
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
Until today we're going to look at this list of

108
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
128 us products

109
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Targeted by China

110
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
The delicious

111
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
List

112
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
Did we mention at the top of the show

113
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,391
And we're going to pick out just a few of these products.

114
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
To talk about

115
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,743
After flipping through this one thing that really stands out is

116
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
The list of pork products

117
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,607
Fresh or cold bone Pig for legs

118
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
Hindquarters in a meter

119
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,215
Pressure cooker pulled pork Frozen whole head in half

120
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
Pork frozen pork liver

121
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
China has slapped

122
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
A 25% extra Terra

123
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
On this thing

124
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
Stacey Vanek Smith

125
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,991
Yeah since you into pork world I went full bacon

126
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
And

127
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Who did Utah

128
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,831
I talked to this man named Brian Duncan he

129
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
He's a hog farmer in Illinois

130
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
It is his family business his father also raised

131
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
Is there something about Hogs that

132
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
People don't know

133
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
But you know from working with them so many

134
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Too many years

135
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
They had opposable thumbs they run the world

136
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
They are

137
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Martin Mystery

138
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,079
I thought that I knew all the things I had to work hip how did life

139
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,407
Fat pigs with opposable thumbs is my new nightmare scene

140
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
I know and in your nightmares let's just hope that

141
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,783
Set the pigs are a little nicer to us

142
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,367
Then we are to them or at least that we are a little bit less delicious

143
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
That would help

144
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:52,511
If you are a pork producer and you all the sudden wake up one morning and find

145
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
That

146
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
One of the main places do you export your product

147
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
2 China has slap this additional

148
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
Tax on it what do you think

149
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,471
Well would Brian told me was it

150
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
The second he heard all the

151
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Did Trump talk about

152
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,871
Steel and aluminum Industries he was just glued to the news he was just

153
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
Waiting for the other shoe

154
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,247
When agriculture know we will be the first targets

155
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
Nerf Retaliator take a look

156
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
I was tryna hit

157
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Starfruit wine and pork

158
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,695
And so I'd say worst fears realized

159
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,255
And why are they always the first because it's just

160
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
I'm thinking back on trade Wars of the past

161
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,911
It's something you back on trade Wars of the past has agriculture always loses out in

162
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
In a trade War easy thing for a country to

163
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,079
And it creates the sort of emotional victims the American Farmer now suffer

164
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
Because of this

165
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Trade War

166
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,943
Yes and Brandy this point too and so did I

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
A couple other people I talk to

168
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:49,087
That China knew that if they hit agriculture they would be hitting Trump or his voters were

169
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,671
Because a lot of the places hit hardest by these tariffs are places that voted for

170
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,279
China knew this and Brian told me that he and all of his friends in a group

171
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
Culture

172
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
Now immediately pork prices

173
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Drop down

174
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
And what happened

175
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
Brian said his pigs lost about

176
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
10% of their value

177
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
About a million dollars on his operator

178
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
Giving up 70000

179
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,431
Which that looks so that's a lot of pain

180
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
We pegues

181
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:19,039
But according to Brian that is a very small operations of a thousand pigs is

182
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,647
Did very very little but he really counts on China

183
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Because

184
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
China not only buys a lot of

185
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
If we're from the US but it also buys these

186
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,815
Cuts of pork that us consumers don't buy their called

187
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Variety

188
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
Ears

189
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Tails

190
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Close

191
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
And all those variety me

192
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Dayton Oregon

193
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,543
Sano fall and things that

194
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,383
That we don't consume your China is a very valuable market for so I

195
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
That actually provides value

196
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:52,063
2 product that maybe was was going in the dumpster as far as American consumers were concerned

197
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,623
So this means that we have to actually eat more

198
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
Four legs and liver

199
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
Well there will be more around

200
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
If you want them

201
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,303
I need the pork industry you have to understand this is a really difficult

202
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Moments

203
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Because according to Brian

204
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,935
The whole industry was really gearing up for this big bump in fur

205
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Free trade

206
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,751
You might remember the trans-pacific partnership

207
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,311
Trade Agreement SPSS big Trade Agreement

208
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
Between the US and a bunch of country is mostly in

209
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
In Asia

210
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:21,759
Trump ended up pulling out of the agreement but the TPP was going to potentially open up a lot more Asian market

211
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
It's the pork

212
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,599
In the US is one of the biggest pork producers in the world

213
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,159
So all these poor farmers in the US or gearing up with

214
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,559
Crispy pork boom and building new facilities and buying more pigs and all the stuff a new golden age of bacon

215
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
Bacon has been a lot of

216
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
Infrastructure put in

217
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
The new packing plant

218
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Should have come online

219
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
There's been new

220
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Hog production

221
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,799
Can come online we're gearing up to meet this

222
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
Yashow market and now it appears we might be

223
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
Not getting knee cap

224
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
Do pigs have knees

225
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
I'm almost sure pigs have knees

226
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
If they do by the way

227
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Friday

228
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Friday

229
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
Don't get all serious that's like what it what is Brian

230
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Do next

231
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:06,559
So what he told me is that he's kind of writing this out right now I mean prices have gone down for him

232
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,375
But what everyone's doing now is really

233
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Looking forward

234
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Because

235
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
A quarter of all the pork raised in the US is

236
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
A lot of ghost

237
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
Sign up but more of it goes to Canada in May

238
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
So now

239
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:25,503
Is obviously a really big deal to poor farmers and the farmers all over the country of all kind soap

240
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,575
He says what everyone's talking about now is what is going to happen

241
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
With NAFTA that's what he's like

242
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,927
Looking at in Frankfurt Airport

243
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
Stacey Vanek Smith

244
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,559
Robert Smith so good to have you on the program from

245
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
Are the program the indicator if you want

246
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Smart Pick

247
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
On economic every single day

248
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
Stacey Vanek Smith

249
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
Is your host with the most

250
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
An indicator is what

251
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
Thanks Robert my pleasure

252
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,199
Art back to the list

253
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:00,319
128 us products targeted by China

254
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Is there are so

255
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Many

256
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
Fruits more fruits that I've ever heard of

257
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
Betelnut fruit

258
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Betel nut

259
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Is a battle or beetle

260
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,863
I don't know with me in the studio is our newest

261
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
Reporter Sarah Gonzalez

262
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,263
And you looked into just one of these many many many many

263
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
Many many fruits

264
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
China has increased

265
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
That fruit is

266
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
Number 55 on the list

267
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,967
The durian fresh durian not frozen durian

268
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,295
So are the durian is very popular in Asia

269
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
In Southeast Asia

270
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
Particular where it grows

271
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
Add to tell me a little bit more about the dirt

272
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
So the durian is

273
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
A pretty big fruit

274
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,863
Size of a baby's head like a pineapple it is famous for

275
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
Smell it has a very intense

276
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Smell

277
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
And The Taste is like

278
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,031
Like whipped cream and caramel with

279
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,567
The raw onion and diced garlic

280
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
So your task was to

281
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Define

282
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
Us

283
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
Durian farmer

284
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
Who is going to be affected by

285
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
These new Terra

286
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:09,439
And I found Ian Crown he on the farm in Las Vegas Puerto Rico

287
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,511
Apparently durian can only grow in areas with really high

288
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Humidity

289
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,607
And so Hawaiian Puerto Rico are the only two places as far as

290
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
Department of Agriculture can tell that grows

291
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
And Ian

292
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Love's

293
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Fresh Dairy

294
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,311
Oh my God the fresh

295
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
You know rocks my world

296
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,455
He's a rare fruit guy robbery actually calls himself a rare fruit nut

297
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,783
So was in worried when he saw that his

298
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Beloved

299
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
Durian

300
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
Was on this list of Chinese tariffs

301
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
He does not care

302
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,719
Even if you wanted to send durian to China

303
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
The US doesn't allow him to

304
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:49,119
No I'm not allowed to ship durian outside of Puerto Rico

305
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
Yeah has to do with pesto

306
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Does anyone in United States

307
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,287
Send durian to China so I went to the Department of Agriculture and I said

308
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
How much durian does the United

309
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
It states send to China the

310
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
Department of Agriculture

311
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Commerce

312
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
In the Department of Commerce was like no I think the department agriculture supposed to know that and then the Department of Agriculture was like we are okay hold

313
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
Let me find out

314
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:14,207
Then eventually the Department of Agriculture told me we have sent very little dirty into China Lake

315
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Really little legs

316
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
0

317
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
0

318
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,351
Pretty funny that he made his way onto the list

319
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:25,727
Yes I would say that they should also put on the list that we're not allowed to ship them any unicorns

320
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,591
The United States has not sent a single jury into China in the past 5 years

321
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
Or mangosteens or rabbit

322
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,431
And Sundays are all fruits that are on

323
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
The list which raises the obvious

324
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
Why would China

325
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
Put a special Terra

326
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
On us

327
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Durian

328
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
If

329
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,439
Imports

330
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
0 USD

331
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:51,327
Facebook to a couple people to try to help me understand this clearly

332
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,911
China and countries in general are really good about putting tariffs on things

333
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
That one actually

334
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Hurt them

335
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
The idea is basically that when the United States threatened

336
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Tariffs

337
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
A country has to make

338
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
If the right back and in order to

339
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Make that threat

340
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Credible

341
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Flip out of the list

342
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
So it could be that they patted the list

343
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,623
The other theory is that they just put every fruit and nut on their list and

344
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
Drury Inn in mangosteens happened to

345
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,767
Be on there they just copied and pasted it into the document it just got caught up

346
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:26,911
I do want to mention that the United States has put some things on its list of proposed tariffs

347
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
That we don't import a whole lot of from China example

348
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,151
On recording cassette players are know what they do if they don't record but

349
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,711
As you can imagine we don't import a whole lot of them

350
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Thank you sir

351
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
Thank you Robert

352
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
At 3

353
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Soy to the world

354
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
The latest tablets work that's out Goldberg by the way

355
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,935
When is topless work is it you start with the smallest

356
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,239
The case of durian the non-existent stuff

357
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,055
But you want to hold back on the really big tariffs

358
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
In case the trade War escalates

359
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
We can talk it so far about products that have already been hit

360
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
With new tariff

361
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,479
But the Chinese have another live

362
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
A list of American Products

363
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
They are threatening to put

364
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
A tariff on

365
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
And I'm at theoretical list

366
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Soybean

367
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
And Alex

368
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,767
Give me the office the other day and he said you are not going to believe what is happening

369
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,863
They don't even have a new tariff on them yet

370
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
But just

371
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
Idea of a new tariff is already

372
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Changing

373
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Where soy flows around the world

374
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
Changing Global Market

375
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
It's already

376
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Soy flour

377
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
We had questions so we call that Mr saw himself

378
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
The man with the tofu heart

379
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
Jim Sutter

380
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,759
And I am the CEO of the

381
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
The US soybean export Council

382
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,391
Jim says about 30% of the American soy crop goes to China

383
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Although

384
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
You would not

385
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Really know it

386
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
If you were in China because it get crushed

387
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
And processed into

388
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Generic cooking oil

389
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Doesn't the USA on the air

390
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
Or feed for livestock

391
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
If you look real closely you might be able to kind of detective

392
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,287
The detectives from soybean meal but that might be a bit of a stretch

393
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
To the Chinese

394
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
They Don't Really Care

395
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,895
If their soybeans come from

396
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
The US

397
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
Or if it comes from somewhere else I just want

398
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
Yeah because it's not like

399
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Branded American

400
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Cancel

401
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
Weather feeding is Alaska

402
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
And so if they can save it

403
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
Few pennies they will buy from our Arch

404
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
Soy rival

405
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,047
So the USA and Brazil are so like the Coke and Pepsi of the soybean world

406
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,703
That's a great analogy if the Coke in the Pepsi the soybean world

407
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
The US embrace

408
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,543
Coke and Pepsi who is cheaper who is cheaper

409
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
Eminem Alex

410
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Something changes

411
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
The entire mark

412
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
What late last week

413
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,735
The Chinese government announces that they might just

414
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Might

415
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Put a timer

416
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
On USC

417
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,367
Show all of the Chinese buyers are suddenly thinking way too

418
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
A tariff would

419
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
Totally change the master

420
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
So

421
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,815
These buyer said wow I better not buy any us soybeans for fear this may happen

422
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
So they already

423
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,911
Brazil and the price of Brazilian soybeans

424
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Champs

425
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
Everyone in China

426
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Who's buying soybeans

427
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,335
They want this tariff-free Brazilian soybean want to lock it in yet and

428
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
In America

429
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Meanwhile

430
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
They're looking around there like wait a minute

431
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
We got somebody funny

432
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
So the price of American soybean

433
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
Relative to Brazilian soybeans

434
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
So it was

435
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,159
You know during the US night time during the day time

436
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
China

437
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
Soybean Futures on the Chicago Market

438
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Computer Exchange

439
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
Dropped by as much as

440
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
Fifty cents a bushel at one point

441
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,191
And it also doesn't mean rough numbers they went from

442
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,543
$10.40 a bushel to $9.90 a bushel

443
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
So

444
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
You know that's a big

445
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Shipt

446
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
Remember Alex

447
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,783
Nothing has changed in the world the sheer number of soybeans in Brazil and United

448
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Exactly

449
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,439
The same there isn't even a tariff yet this is just a maybe in the future we might impose a tariff

450
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
Kind of comment

451
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,279
From China and here's my favorite part when you told the story

452
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
The rest of the world

453
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,863
Like buyers in Europe they look around

454
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
Brazilian prices are going up

455
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
But they don't have a dog in the

456
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,775
Was terrified for them on USI so they're thinking

457
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,359
Look at the us or because they're on sale so you're upset stomach big perch

458
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
Pieces of us

459
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Soybean and Anthony's like

460
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:26,783
Ships that would have been going to Brazil to pick up their soybeans are now headed

461
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
Kid to kid American Fork

462
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
And Europe

463
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Is not the only

464
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,951
I noticed the Taiwan bought a cargo Japan has Bots

465
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Soybean

466
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
Turkey Egypt

467
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
And sure enough with all the new buyers

468
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
The price of American soybeans

469
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
It comes back

470
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Attacking a gym

471
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
He is

472
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Certainly spooked

473
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
Buy this whole incident

474
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
Words alone

475
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
Rattle his whole industry

476
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
If

477
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,407
If soybean tariffs going to affect it could be

478
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
Be devastating for the America

479
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
Farmer

480
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,503
But the interesting about the story is

481
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
Test also created these arbitrary

482
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Winners

483
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
And losers

484
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
You're a

485
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,695
Chinese manufacturer who needs soybeans you're going to be paying more for

486
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,791
But if you're a Brazilian farmer all the sudden you this unexpected windfall

487
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,607
You're not even in the trade work but you get to sell your story for more

488
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:16,191
Answer this is just a reminder that a tariff cannot be a Target

489
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,263
You put a tariff on one product from one country

490
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,591
And it could rearrange the way the entire world market Opera

491
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,639
Never know where the soy sauce is going to flow

492
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,175
Find is level

493
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
Thank you Alex

494
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,759

Forgot

498
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Terrifying

499
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695

519
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
It's called trade talks

520
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
Thanks for listening

521
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,223
Sarah I know something

522
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
Pugilist

523
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,807
Of things there's no peanuts in them

524
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
No peanut

525
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,879
This dried coconut

526
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,207
Is Brazilian nuts shell Brazilian nuts is cashews

527
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
Does almonds and hazelnuts there's

528
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
Walnut

529
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
Chestnuts

530
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
Macadamia nuts

531
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Red pistachios

532
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
Green pistachio

533
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,031
So what happened to peanut obviously I know they're legumes like everyone alright in

534
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,847
If we say they're not but still like peanuts

535
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
You think

536
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:36,735
Yeah I don't know I called up a peanut farmer Tim Burch in south Georgia

537
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
And he said that

538
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
Even peanut Farmers considered

539
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
That's nuts

540
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
They basically think that

541
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,695
Peanuts were left off by accident and they were kind of like

542
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,535
Don't bring attention to this what if China puts us on the list

543
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,607
Because if they are we forgot to include peanuts

544
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,447
Say my name every kind of nut I can think of

545
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
And no

546
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
I don't know why we were left off

547
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
Okay so

548
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
What's a compact

549
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Between you and me

550
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
Okay yeah

551
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Didn't happen
