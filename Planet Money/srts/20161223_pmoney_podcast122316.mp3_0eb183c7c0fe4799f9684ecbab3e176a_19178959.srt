00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:07,168
Hi Stacey Vanek Smith here today show is a rerun David kestenbaum reported for us back in 2004

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:12,544
14 it's about a country to try to make good on a whole lot of bad things that happened during the finance

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,312
Crisis

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
That place

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
Iceland

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,152
Here's the show

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,480
There's this idea that dates back at least a biblica

8
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:24,064
It is that there should be a moment when debts are

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
Call the Jubilee

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,648
Used to throw this money

11
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416
Now you don't

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,976
Where the Bible describes at the Jubilee with a big

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,536
Is supposed to happen every 50 years or so

14
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,072
Apparently a trumpet

15
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,608
A Ram's Horn was blown

16
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,656
And they're Adidas release from debt

17
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,960
In Deuteronomy the Jubilee is described

18
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
Vesely

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,312
Every creditor that lendeth unto his neighbor shall release it

20
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,128
You shall not exactly does his neighbor or of his brother

21
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,432
Because it is called the Lord's release

22
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,016
Getting with that debt is something that can enslave you

23
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
And every so often.

24
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,320
Was best to just wipe

25
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,160
Did you believe not gotten a lot of traction in the modern

26
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,720
You may remember after the financial crisis summary

27
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,512
The Occupy Wall Street protesters

28
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
We're calling for a

29
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,328
Basically it ended

30
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,936
Today on the show we have a story about a country that is actually trying it

31
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
Trying a jubilee hello and welcome to planet

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
Money on David kestenbaum what happens when you just wipe debt clean

33
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
Money and the following message come from Goldman Sachs get insights from some of the world's leading thinkers on markets and destroy

34
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
And the global economy on the firm's podcast exchanges at Goldman Sachs you'll hear discussions on topics

35
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,936
The far-reaching implications like climate change autonomous driving the future of China's economic drug plus much more

36
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
That's exchanges at Goldman Sachs available on iTunes Stitcher SoundCloud on Google Play. GS

00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
. com podcast

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,808
Got into debt the way most people

39
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
She bought something she loved

40
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
But you didn't have them

41
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
Small wooden house in Dracut

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,280
I really like the place because it had such a homey feel they mean the

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,376
Play the floors are wooden and everything is kind of like old style

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
The Windows 7

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,216
Describe cute somehow

46
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,288
You may remember that from one of our earlier Iceland shows

47
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
She's got a little boy named Oscar

48
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
When I visited a few years ago it was cold

49
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,968
Bundling little Oscar out so he could sleep outside

50
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Big stroller

51
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
That's a thing people do at Iceland

52
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
Just leave your kid outside and pop into a

53
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,160
I meant Heather through our former intern Boulder hidden

54
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
A tall guy who were crazy sneakers

55
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
PhD in math but also did some DJing it

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,376
Like him. He also took on a bunch of debt to buy his

57
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,448
An apartment downtown not far from the old Harbour

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,008
I asked him to walk out on the balcony and describe the

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,312
There's a Domino's Pizza on

60
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,848
And there's a seven-eleven

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,176
Hirano store Volcano

62
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,736
But there are like two little

63
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
Like holes in between the big houses where I can see the ocean and you know if you follow

64
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
Things close you can even see a ship sailing into Reykjavik Ocean View

65
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
Two people two mortgages

66
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Two piles of dead

67
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
In any other country they would be expected to pay that debt

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
There'd be no chance of a

69
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,568
But Iceland is this place that does everything a little

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,616
Everything is a little more intensity

71
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
Europe close to the Arctic Circle

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
But the island has volcanic so there's

73
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
The lava field

74
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
And economically it's also in the news

75
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,368
Prince When the financial crisis mess whatever you want

76
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
Going to call it happen

77
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
It happened in a big wave

78
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
3 giant Banks

79
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
How much does the entire economy with

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,096
And something particularly horrifying happened to People's mortgages

81
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
In Iceland a lot of people have these odd adjustable more

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
They just with info

83
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
On a tiny Island inflation can be a

84
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
So that's a video

85
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
And when the financial crisis happened there was a lot of inflation

86
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
The amount people owe on their mortgages

87
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Through the roof

88
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,040
I have to pay that to look up the numbers from what happen

89
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,160
I haven't gone over these numbers at all because it's

90
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,744
With other things depressing you but not the good

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
Idea to waste much time always

92
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Wallowing in it

93
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
Hey that kept getting these statement saying she owed more and more

94
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
Let me just be clear

95
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,775
I don't mean that she just owed more of that month

96
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,567
The total amount she owed

97
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,871
Go to the bank went up by 30%

98
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
It's like if you borrowed $100,000 for your house

99
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,247
All the sudden you owed $130

100
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
It's kind of like

101
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
You are

102
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
Drowning

103
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
That's

104
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
The feeling

105
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,303
That you are trying to keep your head above water but what's happening is that you are just

106
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,887
Going deeper under

107
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,703
After the crisis inflation went back down

108
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
City market just didn't keep growing up

109
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Crazy Ray's

110
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,615
But people were stuck with much larger mortgages than they started with

111
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
It was this wound that just did not go

112
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
If people did not forget about

113
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
So in 2013

114
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,831
Five years after the financial crisis

115
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,671
When Iceland's Progressive Party found itself with very low poll numbers

116
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
It proposed

117
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
The Jubilee

118
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
No didn't call it

119
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
They call it correct

120
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
Yeah I like the correction

121
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,727
Corrects like there was something you know wrongly calculated and they need to correct it

122
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
That's kind of how

123
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,383
Putting it right they want to put things right that's how they frame it

124
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Satan Icelandic

125
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,199
Lavida thinking

126
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,223
One more time

127
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,527
Lazy idiot in Korean

128
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,599
The Progressive Party was promising to go back and correct

129
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,623
Everyone's mortgages

130
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,927
Basically forgive the additional debt

131
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,767
Everyone has built up during the crisis during those two years 2008

132
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
It's a beautiful idea that you could go back

133
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
Try to undo this one very painful

134
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Part of the financial

135
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
Make it like it never happened

136
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
I asked if there was something Icelandic

137
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
About the Sandia

138
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
I'm going back and fixing it

139
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
Something from the stories of the Viking days

140
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
The old Saga

141
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
No you usually Messiah to just dream about what's going to happen in the future

142
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,927
I'm sorry for all of us

143
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,023
No it's not usually that anything is just going to put your head down and keep going but

144
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,143
So something really new

145
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
Maybe for that reason

146
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
Is very an Icelandic Miss

147
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
The Jubilee Proposal with very

148
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,663
Oliver arneson is an author and economic thinker he was one of the people out making the case for the Jubilee

149
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
I remember one

150
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Raleigh

151
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
This was in February something like that February March

152
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
And to get out during during the winter it's very dark here and I sent them that we had a this was in the evening in the middle of the

153
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
The week in the east

154
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
Up the country

155
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
People drove

156
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
150 MI

157
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,887
Come to this rally at least

158
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Completely

159
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
Filled the auditorium

160
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,775
The meeting lasted till something like 11:30 and then they had

161
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
3 hours drive back

162
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
Empty show up for work the next morning

163
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,991
This this was very important to people and they were really really passionate about it

164
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
One obstacle to trying out of Jubilee

165
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,855
Forgiving debt is that there's always someone on the

166
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
There's someone who lent

167
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
But there was a plan to make even this part feel pain

168
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
The money to pay for the Jubilee

169
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,071
Would come from a tax on those

170
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Read dead Icelandic bag

171
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
Thanks that many people in Iceland blame for their financial

172
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,031
Today most of what remains of the bank's is owned by hedge funds

173
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
Foreign investors

174
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,615
Saudi money coming from hedge funds

175
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
Find investors

176
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,223
Going to pay off the debts of ordinary people like balder and Haida

177
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,807
When Oliver without making a case of those political rallies

178
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
He told people this was the right thing to do

179
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,671
It's a recognition

180
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
It's a recognition it's a moral

181
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Recognition

182
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
That

183
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
Things happened here

184
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
That were beyond the control

185
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
Of Norm of the

186
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
Average people

187
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
And

188
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,751
The government is showing

189
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
An effort

190
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
To recognize

191
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
Did you believe became the focus of the entire election

192
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
Progressive Party ran on it

193
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
And one

194
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:25,087
This is the same last name

195
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,135
Election results started to come in

196
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
Hotel in Reykjavik

197
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Where supporters of gather

198
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
Green balloons everyone clapping in unison

199
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,815
I'm looking at this moment it seems so perfect

200
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Iceland

201
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,167
Had an ideal setup to try out this very old idea but you be

202
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
You got a clearly-defined chunk of debt

203
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
The people all across the country have

204
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Mortgages

205
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,127
Any of a source of what feels like free money to pay for

206
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Does dead bat

207
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,991
There's a lot of math lot of details about how it would all work

208
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
But just a couple weeks ago

209
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
It was all finalized

210
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,391
Headout went online to see how much that she was going to have forgiven

211
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
How much she was going to get from the Jubilee

212
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:08,095
Yes okay so what we're going to do is we are going to go into the ditch

213
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,399
Threats of internal revenue

214
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,543
And find out how they are going to amend my more

215
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
More more

216
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Mortgage

217
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,175
Markets

218
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:30,623
It says welcome and here is the result

219
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,927
So so it is

220
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
1 1/2 well

221
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,791
A little over one and a half million

222
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
1.5 million Icelandic

223
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
About 12000

224
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:46,239
Now thinking of Jubilee maybe you think of a party people dancing in the streets

225
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,543
And someone just knocked $12,000 off

226
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Off my mortgage

227
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
I'd be really happy

228
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,639
They were plenty of happy people in Iceland

229
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,943
One person tweeted finally finally

230
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
And another everything will be corrected today

231
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
Edit vote for her pipe

232
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
She's pretty subdued

233
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
Until I actually

234
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,743
I don't know if I'm really skeptical or if I'm not this trusting but

235
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,071
If I see the money and doing form

236
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,631
Then I will be quite happy

237
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Curse

238
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
But until then

239
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,519
This is the still just kind of

240
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,431
Anna and idea and idea of money that's might come in some form over some. Of time

241
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,247
So that's how crazy it seems that you don't actually believe it till you again

242
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Yeah

243
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
At father

244
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
How much money are you getting

245
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
And new

246
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Nothing

247
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
This is the other reason head I was not celebrating the

248
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,351
Friend father also has a mortgage

249
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,167
That apartment where I can kind of see the ocean from the balcony

250
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
But he bought it

251
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,727
Just after the cutoff

252
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
For the Jubilee

253
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
On paper at Jubilee is this nice simple

254
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
Batting practice

255
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
You can't forgive all day

256
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,479
So what that exactly are you going to forgive

257
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
You got a pic

258
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
And whatever you pick

259
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
They're going to be hit has involved

260
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,671
People who benefit from the Jubilee living next to people who get nothing

261
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,767
How does it feel not to be getting any money

262
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Doesn't feel great

263
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
Not getting

264
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,799
Any money I mean

265
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
I had a student loan

266
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
That.

267
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,199
That's been talked like crazy and they're not

268
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:36,319
I don't see why it they if they fit doing this for mortgages why don't they do this

269
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,183
For for students student loans as well so I mean

270
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
I'm happy for him

271
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Let's just getting it

272
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,071
But the little girl singing it feels very

273
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Unfair

274
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
Did you believe that people like Baldur

275
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,959
And people who arguably need help the most

276
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,775
People didn't have enough money to buy a house

277
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,103
They were hurt by the financial crisis but they're not getting anything

278
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
That's the way this Jubilee work

279
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,711
If you didn't have a mortgage you don't get anything

280
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,063
The Atlantic media have run stories about some of the weird consequences of the

281
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,415
There's one guy who sold his house for more money than you bought it

282
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
You made money on it

283
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,511
But it's still going to be getting a check from the Jubilee

284
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
He says he doesn't need it

285
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
Some people have said they're going to give their money to charity

286
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,399
I talked to gylfi Magnus

287
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
He's an economist at the University of

288
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,751
He got a mortgage and five kids

289
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
But he thinks the Jubilee is a bad idea

290
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,127
The money for the Jubilee May feel like free money he says

291
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
But it's not

292
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,967
Sure it's coming from a tax the government levied on those dead.

293
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
Recess

294
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,807
You should think of that money just as government revenue

295
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
Money the government has from taxes

296
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
American spend on whatever it wants

297
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
Doesn't have to be a jubilee

298
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
Could spend it on education

299
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Healthcare

300
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
Something that would help a broader number of people

301
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,143
Yukon to use government resources to put everybody

302
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
Barca pre-crisis

303
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
No income and wealth

304
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,407
You have to be much more selective on how you use government funds because you

305
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
There are many good needs good uses for government on send that you can squander them

306
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
Getting any money from the Jubilee

307
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
Yes I will

308
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Can I ask how much

309
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,839
Well the household so that will beans with me and my wife will be getting a bit over 2 million Krona

310
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
$20,000

311
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
What are you going to do with the money

312
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
Well since it's actually funds that you received but it's just the reduction of of that so

313
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,383
Basically we don't do anything we just or less

314
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
You're not going to donate it to charity or something I'm not saying you should have just asked

315
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
No

316
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,087
I have five children so I have to

317
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:50,463
Be Frugal even if I am not happy with it

318
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
Is there somebody that's happy to get the money

319
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,375
Not really high and it's this

320
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Come on it's a lot of money

321
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,567
Well yeah I guess it is and then

322
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:12,479
Maybe somebody is happy I don't know I haven't thought about it in those terms.

323
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,063
I really am not happy with the program itself

324
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,439
If you're wondering if the Jubilee might stimulate the overall economy help the Atlantic economy grow

325
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,279
Both guilty and Oliver the guy out making the case for the Jubilee

326
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
Said it's not much of a

327
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,887
People's overall mortgages are getting reduced

328
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
The total amount they always going

329
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,239
But when you look at the effect on monthly payments

330
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
It's not so bad

331
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,823
Guilty figures his monthly payments going to go down by

332
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
About 80 bucks

333
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
I think when people talk about Jubilee

334
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
Biblical idea of wiping the Slate

335
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
Imagine That All the Troubles Disappear With

336
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
But it's not a magic solution

337
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
Once you get over the thrill of the idea

338
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
You realize

339
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
Jubilee is just a government policy

340
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Some people think it's good so

341
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Bad

342
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
And on the tiny Island like Iceland

343
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,607
It's something to have a strong opinion about

344
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
And to argue about

345
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
Haida is both happy and not happy about the job

346
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
She's happy for the extra money

347
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,775
The single mom these days

348
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
But she's thought about this

349
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
And father thought

350
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,919
And they both come down on the side of thinking that the Jubilee

351
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
It's just a bad day

352
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,527
It's a I think it on a personal level like if you look at

353
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,879
Each individual case it's in many cases great that people get money but

354
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,231
That is I don't know it feels like

355
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
You know they're doing some justice but

356
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
If the Injustice is

357
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,167
Is more than that Justice had the joint the whole thing is is not

358
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
Koosh

359
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
Is there something silly about the ATM

360
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
Thinking we can go back and fix something like

361
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,687
I suppose this is kind of like in the old Cyrus

362
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Where

363
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,527
People are going to do something right

364
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,343
But they ended up doing something

365
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
Kind of worse

366
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,487
As in people build fires that all about

367
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
Prevent

368
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:06,911
And it just kind of ends up with everybody is killing everybody one guy kills another guy

369
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,471
And then he gets revenge. And then they have to Revenge because

370
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,823
The other guy Revenge then it's just in the anthers to shoot Bloodbath

371
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,175
Come on nobody's dying here and there that you're getting money from it from Ed dead Bang

372
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
But they also

373
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,671
Okay it's nice to go back and correct things and and make everything

374
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
You know

375
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,607
Nice but if the government wrote world is coming in and fixing my bad mistakes I mean I bought a car

376
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
Turned out to be crap and I spent a lot of money on it then I'm not getting any of that money back I mean

377
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
What type of car again

378
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
But then I don't deserve

379
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,127
But to be corrected in anyway I mean

380
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,455
It's not the government's job to

381
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
You know come in

382
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
Correcting

383
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:59,391
The government should be building roads and creating a system where you where it's nice to live but not

384
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
And I'm not taking on

385
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:06,303
Private that we should correct the future and not the past right

386
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
An environment that's good for the future

387
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:13,471
Hey guys have a political campaign that you can run

388
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
Directing the future is of course the path that we usually

389
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
It's an easier sell

390
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,407
The future is Unwritten you can dream it will be whatever you want

391
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
The past is already here

392
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
Complicated

393
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
Surprisingly hard

394
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,951
One more thing we're going to handle the song that hit adjust

395
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:39,327
To the musician it's actually the first song She's recorded and it did really well and got played a bunch of the radio

396
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
Headed you want to sing something

397
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:46,495
Hahaha

398
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:50,335
But if you want to play like a piece of my song that would be super cool

399
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,687
Online what do you want me to sing the chorus

400
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
How's it going

401
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:00,063
I got your back baby

402
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,671

403
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:10,047
I got your back I got your back

I got your back.

406
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335

407
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
What Iceland looks like

408
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
