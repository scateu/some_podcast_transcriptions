1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:06,912
There are these videos you may have seen in December it felt like they were everywhere for a while there

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:13,312
Stop from cars driving down the 405 freeway in Los Angeles it's dark out

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:19,712
The cars drive through this Valley and they pass between two Hills that are completely

4
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:26,112
On fire it looks like the cars are driving

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:32,000
Straight down into hell

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,792
I grew up not far from those Hills

7
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,816
And I spent

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,120
A lot of time watching these videos as

9
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,936
Wildfires were spreading throughout Southern California

10
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
It was a really bad virus

11
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
I'm about to get on the 405

12
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,688
I went to Los Angeles in January because I really wanted

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
Stand on those Hills

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,784
I wanted to see

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
What do they look like now

16
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Soap

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
I drove up there

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,160
I got out of my car and

19
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,208
Right away I saw a house that

20
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
Clearly

21
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
Burnt wow pasta house there was a trail leading up into the hills I can see the four

22
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
405 freeway down blow me twisted up trees

23
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:21,152
Oh my God there's like a shell of a car on the side of the Hill

24
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,272
Walking through a weird Wasteland it's really eerie

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,344
I don't know what exactly I'm looking at

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,160
Except that the fire was definitely

27
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
Here

28
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,256
But I called someone who would know what he

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584
Hi are you Robert

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
Hello

31
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,168
Robert Rowe agree to meet me here because

32
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,728
He can look at a burnt up Hillside like this

33
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,776
And read it like a book

34
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
He's a former firefighter

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,664
And for more than a decade now he has had his own fire investigation

36
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,320
I design my own logo little little guy with a magnifying glass with a flat top and

37
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,112
Espiral Got Run

38
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
And your pirate

39
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,208
We start walking up the hill together

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,744
So when you walk

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
Up here

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
What do you notice first I mean to me it just looks like a sort of

43
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
Apocalyptic

44
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Bland

45
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
So

46
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,264
As we're approaching a a shrub here

47
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
We're going to be looking at

48
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
Robert starts turning over

49
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,176
Rock climbing up trees that are burned almost

50
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
Despot that were in it's like

51
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
One chapter of the fire that burned here

52
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
What was called the skirball fire

53
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
A discoloration on

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
Reading this

55
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256
See where the Flames were coming from

56
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:45,632
Were they traveling up the hill or down the hill or across the hill

57
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
When we got up to

58
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
Peak

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,496
He tells me that far traveler there's no question

60
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
Did you see that right when you walked on the scene

61
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
Well

62
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,408
Yeah pretty much when a wildfire breaks out

63
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,248
Pyro cops like Robert they show up at the scene and they have

64
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
Enormous

65
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
Power

66
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Because

67
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,160
The spot the fire started and the reason it started

68
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Those are going to have

69
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
Huge consequences

70
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
For a lot of people

71
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:17,632
You can identify the source of ignition down to fraction of an inch

72
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
And it becomes somebody's equipment

73
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
That either failed or somebody's action

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
Then

75
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
I'm going to go to jail

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,944
Or somebody's going to have a hefty recovery bill but they're going to have to pay

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
Billions

78
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
Billions of the bee

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
Billions

80
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,880
Hello and welcome to Planet Money on Sally home

81

And I'm Kenny Malone

82
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,720
Wildfires are not like other natural

83
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:48,352
World disasters because you can't pin an earthquake on a single Reckless teenager you can't

84
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,912
Teresa hurricane back to the first Gustav

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,752
But with a wildfire you can find your way back

86
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
To the first

87
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Spark

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
You can find a reason this disaster happened

89
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
And sometimes

90
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
Someone has to pay

91
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736

How to find a source of a deadly wildfire

93
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
How to find the line

Moritz servicenow.com

108
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
There's an official list of the

109
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
The top 10 most

110
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Struct wildfires

111
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,071
And if you look at that list three of those fires happened in the last six

112
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
It is been a horrific fire scene

113
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,679
And next to each of those

114
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Fires on this list

115
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
He's like a little note

116
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Where the

117
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
The cause of the fire

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
All of these recent fire

119
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
It says

120
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
Under

121
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
It could take months

122
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
For those investigations to wrap up

123
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,271
And so

124
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
We're going to look back at a different fire

125
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
One of the biggest most destructive fires in California history

126
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:21,023
And we're going to tell the story of how that blank got filled in and

127
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,631
Presidents are getting worried that they must leave their homes immediately

128
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
Within just the first

129
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,215
Few hours at The Witch Creek fire burn

130
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
Starfire quadrupled in size and white now

131
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,639
On October 21st 2007 The Witch Creek fire started

132
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Somehow

133
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
And then spread

134
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Shockingly

135
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
It was unclear exactly how bad the damage would be but

136
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
One thing was

137
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,879
Clear The Witch Creek Fire was going to be one of the big one

138
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,231
I was on duty in Riverside unit as a fire captain specialist

139
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
This is Matt

140
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
He works for a state agency known as Cal Fire

141
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
Bass we got a phone call

142
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
Sending me to the witch fire

143
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
Media origin causes

144
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
When is the murder you

145
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
There's a fire

146
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
You send Matt Gill

147
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,919
Matt drives towards the area where the first reports came

148
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
From which means

149
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
Gives driving towards

150
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
The fire

151
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
Which is pretty intense

152
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
But Matt seems chill about it

153
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,391
Empire on both sides of the road

154
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
What was that like

155
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
Fairly typical for a job

156
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
Somax driving through

157
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
Two sided fire

158
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
And he can see which way the Flames are blowing in the wind

159
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
So he knows roughly

160
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Where the fire is coming

161
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,263
He drive down to the edge of the burn Zone

162
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,103
There's still some smoke around black and grasses everywhere

163
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
This is where he starts

164
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
His investigation

165
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,991
The part where I was at was on top of a ridge

166
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,343
The wind was blowing to the point where I'm at at moments it was very difficult not very difficult

167
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,671
But you can definitely feel the winds blowing your progress is your wife

168
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,975
The format can figure out what started this

169
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,303
He needs to figure out exactly where this fire stick

170
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
And the fire leaves a lot of signs

171
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
It's been an investigator like Matt

172
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Can follow back

173
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,775
He can see the direction that the fire burned across

174
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
A tree

175
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
It's like an arrow pointing him towards the

176
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Same is true with

177
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
Charred rocks on the

178
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Trash

179
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,503
Cans and bottles anything that's left on the ground

180
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:24,159
He walks and walks follow the fires Trail and whines up at what he is almost certain is

181
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
Is the spot the fire started

182
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
The sign

183
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
Pointing Towards the Sky

184
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
There's a dirt road winding through this

185
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Rocky ranchland

186
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,167
You would not be surprised if he's a cowboy riding through the background

187
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,495
And this is the point where the process changes

188
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
Now that is looking for the actual cause

189
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Fire

190
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,639
And it is sort of like the game Clue

191
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
Like he's figured out

192
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,967
That the crime was committed in the conserva

193
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Satori

194
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
And

195
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,111
He doesn't just get to look down and see if there's a wrench or revolver lying there

196
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
He has to

197
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Eliminate all of the

198
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
Weapon choices

199
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
And figure out what actually started

200
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,839
Yeah that's a process process of elimination it's a way to make sure he's being as

201
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
Thorough and scientific

202
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
Possible

203
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
And Matt has been like

204
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
Fire investigator school

205
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,359
You have a whole list of these potential fire causes in his head

206
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Debris burning

207
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Lightning

208
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
Spontaneous combustion

209
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
What is that

210
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,087
This is where I often times you will see you in

211
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
Like a mulch pile

212
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
Under the right conditions

213
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
Can Sophie and

214
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Wow really

215
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
Yes

216
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
Petscop

217
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Okay

218
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Somat looks around

219
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
For mulch piles

220
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
You didn't see anything

221
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
You check the dirt for tire tracks

222
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
Because cars can start a fire

223
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
He looks berglas

224
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,991
Bottles apparently in rare circumstances sunlight can refract through a glass bottle

225
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Start a wildfire

226
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,575
Matt doesn't see anything like that laying around

227
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,135
How about smoking ice out of here about you know

228
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,719
Don't flick a cigarette out your car window or whatever is that is that a real thing

229
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
It's

230
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
Not as common as one might think

231
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
All my partners and I carry a pack of cigarettes in the truck

232
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
And

233
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,215
We tried it and I have yet to

234
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,031
Mets sifting through dirt

235
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
Shearing under rocks checking

236
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
Weather report

237
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
He sees no cigarettes

238
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
No signs of arson no reports of lightning

239
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
Well at this point after all those

240
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Right now we're looking at the power

241
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
The power lines

242
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
Really technical at this point in our conversation

243
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
He speaks carefully

244
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,511
I was able to observe damage to the power lines

245
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,095
Where it appeared to be small sections of the power line work

246
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,423
When you said small sections were missing he means that there

247
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,727
Little Nick's in the metal wire

248
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
Spots of

249
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Visible damage

250
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
Do you sort of thing

251
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
Do you know what's going on at that point

252
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,175
At this point it's not a 100%

253
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Determination

254
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
But

255
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,783
I've got something that bears further follow up

256
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,647
Here's the part of the story where we say the company that owned those power lines San Diego Gas & Electric

257
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:11,327
Never remember Matt starts this investigation on day one of the fire and within a day or two he is already zero

258
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Zeroing in on a car

259
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,935
But he won't release information until he's done

260
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Complete

261
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,287
Location and so he keeps on investigating

262
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:25,151
In the meantime all the public knows at this point is that the Witch Creek Fire is burning

263
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,943
And spreading and is very day

264
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
People actually did die in this fire

265
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
And other people are trying to escape

266
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:36,159
Some of them are recording videos as a cruiser homes thread

267
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Is here

268
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,535
You can hear all the fire trucks in the distance

269
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,119
One person looking out his window seeing all of this

270
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Is Terry single

271
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
In very short order

272
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
The sky

273
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
Wildfire was moving Dangerously

274
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
Close to Terry sing

275
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
So you were ready you were

276
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
Pretty much packed up

277
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,247
Stuff I really did not want to lose weight

278
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,087
50 years of photographs and that sort of thing

279
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,415
Cancel documents but that was it

280
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Mostly photos

281
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Yeah I think I also have my

282
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Terry's able to laugh about this now

283
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,911
In part because the fire spared his house but

284
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,239
He's an attorney and he's part of this neat legal industry

285
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
Actually more like

286
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
2 Army

287
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
Did start lining up

288
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
When a wild fire starts to spread

289
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,455
Terry in the past as represented victims of wildfires just like this

290
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
And so

291
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Carrie starts

292
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,087
Getting calls from people who are losing their homes

293
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
And they're saying

294
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Terry

295
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,975
Is there going to be anything we can do about this and on the other side

296
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Car companies

297
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
We're calling their attorneys and wonder

298
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
Are we going to get sued for this

299
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
And some of them may have called

300
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Ready camp

301
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
Anything that can create a spark

302
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,823
Can anyone who can be responsible for creating that spark could be a client of mine someday

303
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,431
In 2007 Randy was a lawyer for a cable company and a tree trimming

304
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
That got sued

305
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
Over other big fires burning near which Creek

306
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,879
Randy has been a part of this Wildfire legal world for years

307
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
He says

308
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
When a fire starts spreading

309
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,999
You'll have all these opposing lawyers and

310
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
They hire private fire investigators

311
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
Insurance companies have lawyers and

312
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
Their own investigators

313
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,959
They're all showing up on the perimeter of these buyers

314
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Sometimes

315
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Literally

316
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Upma

317
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:34,175
I'll go to places I was working a fire in Texas Nathaniel still burning I'm walking down this dirt road mystalk small town

318
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
Town in Texas I turn the corner

319
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
And there are five guys I know

320
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
It's like a traveling Road Show sometimes

321
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,647
So Randy hears about the fires in San Diego and

322
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
And he goes down there

323
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:49,279
Terry the lawyer for victims he's there to both of them are getting information

324
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
Turn from their

325
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,167
Gators word is going around that power lines may have been involved in one of the fires

326
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,007
And so these two legal armies are gearing up

327
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
But the official word on the cause

328
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Is going to come

329
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
Forum at Gilbert

330
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895

Matt Gilbert had Cena's damage power lines

344
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
The origin of the Witch

345
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Witch Creek Fire but

346
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,943
To be sure about the cause he got in touch with

347
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
The first person to report the

348
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
It was a pilot

349
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
Who works with the same state agency is

350
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Cal Fire

351
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,951
The pilot was in the air over which Creek and saw the fire when it was still small

352
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
Matt wants to know if he

353
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
He'd seen anything weird around that spot

354
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
And the pilot says

355
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
You know

356
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
Okay did see something

357
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Power lines

358
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
Observe the line of

359
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
Bluish colored flashes

360
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
That works

361
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
Blowing With the Wind waves

362
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:14,015
To be as certain as possible Matt gets access to data from San Diego Gas & Electric about those very Powerline

363
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
Find sea salt the area of Orange

364
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
It's her technical data but

365
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
He reads it

366
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
And conclude

367
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,999
On the day of the fire just minutes before that fire was first reported

368
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
Something has

369
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
With the power lines

370
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
That very well may have

371
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Caused

372
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
The first Spark

373
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
So at this point are you 100% sure

374
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
At this point I was comfortable

375
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
Releasing the official cause of the

376
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,407
Would you say 100%

377
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
Basically at this point when I

378
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
Based on all the available information I have

379
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,367
I think in that Gilbert speak that means he's Shore

380
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,183
He says in the scheme of fires he's investigating

381
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
This one was pretty clear

382
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,535
Enzyme that releases the official cause of the witch King

383
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
Greek fire

384
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
It was the power lines operated by

385
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
San Diego Gas

386
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Electric

387
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,215
Lawyers had already launched into the legal battle

388
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
Lawsuit said Rd

389
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Been filed

390
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
And now with an official cause

391
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
Even more Suits start time

392
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,407
How many cases were there about this fire

393
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
I think

394
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
That number includes the Witch Creek Fire and those two other fires that were burning nearby at the same time and it was actually Eva

395
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
Even more than two.

396
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
All told there were about

397
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
26

398
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
100 claims

399
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Spawn by those fires

400
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,399
Loads of people sued San Diego Gas & Electric

401
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,215
San Diego Gas & Electric turned around and sued

402
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Some other companies like

403
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:44,383
Randy's clients who are in charge of tree trimming for example victims Sue those companies as well

404
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
Kenny everybody is suing everybody

405
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
And

406
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
In the end

407
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
The companies

408
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,551
Do not admit fault or liability

409
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,391
But they do pay a lot of money in settlement

410
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,975
In total for all the fires plus legal fees

411
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
More than two

412
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
Billion dollars

413
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,119
That money got paid out by a number of entity

414
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,935
All told San Diego Gas & Electric

415
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
Themselves

416
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
Had to pay a reported

417
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,799
379 million dollars

418
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
The lawyers and

419
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
People who lost money or stuff

420
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
In the fires

421
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,247
This whole process this whole Witch Creek Fire industry

422
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Actually

423
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Isn't even wrapped up yet

424
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:28,159
There are still some lawsuits and loose ends getting sorted out and it's been more than

425
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
10

426
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
Years since that first start

427
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
Terry though the lawyer for the victims

428
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
He's settled all his case

429
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,887
I asked what it felt like when he settled the last one

430
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
Emotional experience

431
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Going through that

432
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
You're supposed to be representing

433
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
And you

434
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
You try to protect

435
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,527
Terry says these big settlement payments do a couple things

436
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
They mean that

437
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,855
Victims get help rebuilding their lives

438
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,671
Money on top of any Wildfire insurance they may have

439
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,767
And the settlements also hold companies accountable

440
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,607
So they'll do all they can to prevent the next big wildfire

441
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
Get to prevent a disaster

442
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,727
But this raises an almost philosophical Quest

443
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
What is a natural

444
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Disaster

445
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
And what is a disaster caused

446
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,919
Like if a deadly Wildfire is started by a light

447
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,223
Strike is it a natural disaster then

448
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
Probably

449
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
How about a bottle

450
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
Left there by human

451
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
Just the wrong way by sunlight

452
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
Is Hannibal the Foster

453
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Maybe

454
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:38,047
And it started by a power line

455
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
Filter by humans

456
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,167
Who are supposed to be making sure that it doesn't cause a fire

457
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
Things like that could be a human disaster

458
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:51,103
But climate change maybe making it harder to say what is an act of God and what's an act

459
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
A man like

460
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:58,527
What if a spark comes from a power line and then it lands on super dry brush that is dry because of a historical

461
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
A long drought

462
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
Where does the natural disaster end

463
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
Human disaster

464
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Begin

465
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,791
Back above the 405 freeway in Los Angeles I was

466
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
Heading home out of those Burnt Hills

467
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,887
And I stopped in front of that house

468
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,287
Oh my God you can see the the roofs caved in exposed pipes there's

469
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,591
Black and bean sticking up

470
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,687
Still don't know the source of many of the big fires that

471
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
California last year

472
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
But

473
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,063
Investigators actually did find the cause of this one

474
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,439
It was a cooking fire in a homeless encampment a little ways down the mountain

475
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Any Spark

476
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
Can start a fire

477
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,839
But not all Sparks are financially

478
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:50,495
Sequel for the Spire there will be no huge settlement to help pay the price

479
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:03,295
