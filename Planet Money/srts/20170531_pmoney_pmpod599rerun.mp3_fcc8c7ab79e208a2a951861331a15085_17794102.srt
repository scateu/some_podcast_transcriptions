00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,632
Hey it's Jacob Goldstein Today Show is a rerun it originally aired in 2015

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,960
You know your parents are you going on about

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,264
Sometime in the past they say were

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,288
Perfect

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,312
My mama was summer catch

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
I have decided when I was a kid that I missed out on

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
VI

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,832
You didn't seem like this magical time this perfect thing from you know back in the day

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,624
The guy you're going to hear about today

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648
Hernando de Soto

11
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,952
The thing his parents used to talk about all the time

12
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
Was Peru

13
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:36,864
The whole country was born and proved they had to move right there was a cool they got kicked out of the country he grew up in Switzerland

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,424
But the whole time he kept hearing about

15
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,472
All the time in Exile

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288
The love of my country came through my ears

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,360
Came through my parents telling me what Latin America was like

18
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,688
And to them it was Paradise of course they been exiled

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
That's the way you thought about proof

20
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,528
But eventually when he was 38

21
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,320
He decided to move back to

22
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Back to this

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
Eden heat hurt so much

24
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,720
And I go back to Eden find out it isn't even little bit of purgatory there

25
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Purgatory

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,560
DeSoto knew of course that Peru was a pork

27
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,400
But he didn't fully appreciate what that meant until he moved

28
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,216
Where Switzerland was this place where the

29
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
The streets were clean

30
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
Trains ran on time

31
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
And frankly almost everybody was pretty well-off

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,128
Peru was a poor country

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,992
In the streets of the capital DeSoto saw people carrying stuff to sell on their back

34
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,064
Pushing stuff through the streets and tiny little carts

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,392
In the streets they sell everything from food to repair parts

36
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,184
Two motorcycles to bicycle

37
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
They sell everything

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
DeSoto

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
Does poverty spread out all around

40
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Many wonders

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,888
Why is Bruce so much poorer than places like Switzerland

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,240
I have no idea I mean I didn't know where poverty came from my bread Adam Smith

43
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
I'd already started delving in marks and all that

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,104
But they also had you know I can

45
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Replies

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,712
I didn't understand why was technology being what it is

47
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
Why in the Dickens

48
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
Arduino more-developed mean

49
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,880
And I said there's got to be an invisible wall someplace that's fine the wall

50
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
That's what I went to look

51
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,256
DeSoto went to look for the invisible wall that was trapping poor people

52
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
Poland poverty

53
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
And be found

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
What Hernando de Soto found a transform Peru in four countries around the world and also how it almost

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
We'd like to say a quick thank you and share a message from one of our spa

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
Panthers State Farm State Farm is much more than just an insurance company they're also committed to making a pot

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
Positive impact in the communities they serve one way is through neighborhood of good a program connecting people

59
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
I want to make a difference with causes looking for local volunteers discover over 31,000 social cause

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
Listed at neighborhood of good.com and start turning the power of caring into the act of doing

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
State Farm here to help life go right the story starts right around 1980

62
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
Right around then is when Hernando de Soto move back to

63
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
De Soto is a business

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
He's not an academic

65
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,024
But he keeps chewing over this really abstract question

66
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
What is

67
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Holding Peru back

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
At first

69
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,936
He's kind of working over this question on the weekends is actually

70
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,752
Walking around talking to the guy selling stuff on the street

71
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
After a while I found out that

72
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:31,200
They were in the street but they didn't like me in the street because he needs running water he doesn't have running water

73
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,760
He wants to be away from thieves

74
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,112
And he wants to have Stocks & Refrigeration which you can't have in the street

75
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,184
Basically what these guys wanted was to move into a market

76
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
You know one of those places with

77
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,000
It's some kind of roof

78
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
Cement floor

79
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
Gotz dolls on one side

80
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
People selling vegetable

81
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Spices

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
No sim installed

83
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
Butchers in

84
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
Find clothes and shoes

85
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
That's what they wanted

86
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,264
So why weren't they there

87
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
It was an obvious answer

88
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
I always figured they didn't have

89
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,736
More space they didn't have refrigeration because they didn't have the money cuz they just couldn't afford to pay for

90
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Here I am

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
Stall with the same question you are right

92
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
The same pressure now they don't have the money they don't have

93
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,256
But at the same time since I'm befriending them I'm walking them through their homes right

94
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
I'm going to see where they live and what they do

95
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
Then I look at the roof

96
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,399
Cuz it's Flats okay so I look on top and I see

97
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
My God you got cement back

98
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
And you've got the bricks

99
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
And you got pieces of iron

100
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
These vendors to have at least

101
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,199
Somebody they saved enough to build a solid house they're saving more so they can put another floor on that house

102
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
So money is

103
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
Not the thing

104
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
Keeping the vendors out of the mark

105
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,879
And also to see those bricks on the roof and realizes something

106
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
People and crew aren't saving the way people in welfare cont

107
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
Instead of saving money in the bank

108
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
What you're doing is you're sitting in bricks

109
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Cement bags

110
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
B Street vendors don't have been cake

111
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
DeSoto discovers

112
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,823
Poor people in Peru are missing out on all kinds of basic things we take for granted

113
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,383
They're basically living outside the cyst

114
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175
They don't have a deed

115
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
It says they own their house

116
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,503
They don't have a permit that says they can run their business

117
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Set a realizes he have to do more than just

118
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
Wander around and chat with

119
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Really understand what

120
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
The next thing he does

121
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,207
I think it makes him famous

122
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
She doesn't expire

123
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
He runs an actual X

124
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,863
He wants to see what it would take to actually live

125
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
Inside the legal system

126
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
Instead of

127
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
So we decided to set up a shirt

128
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
To get all the proper paperwork all the permits

129
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,895
You rent space in a warehouse he buys a few sewing machines and

130
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
Knitting machine

131
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
But he has no plan to ever make

132
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
A Single Shard

133
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
He just wants to see what it would take

134
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
So he hires a lawyer and if

135
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Any tell them

136
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
Go out

137
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
And do everything you have

138
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
Did make us a fully legal shirt

139
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
Figure out how long it all

140
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
Here's a stopwatch go

141
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Get on the bus

142
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
Find out what you have to do so they went out

143
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:02,495
And they did the red tape so they'd go to an officer they were told was in office that granted

144
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
The license to

145
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
To operate a machine

146
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
And they

147
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
They find it they were told no

148
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,223
It's not here anymore addresses change go elsewhere if you got to take another bus

149
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
So they actually took the buses

150
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
They had to get 11 different permit

151
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Seven different

152
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
They're asked for bribes 10 times

153
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
I'd actually pay bribe

154
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Twice

155
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Debbie do everything in a certain order

156
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Lots of

157
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Incredibly

158
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
In total

159
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,167
You would take at least 278 days working 8 hours a day

160
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
To get the permit

161
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
To operate

162
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
To do business with

163
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Spotify

164
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,919
And and what do you get for eight or nine months of work of taking bus give you Authority

165
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
You get the authority

166
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
To open your little fact

167
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,111
Just the cause of being able to open that and the cop can't come in and close your factory

168
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
DeSoto get

169
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Obsessed

170
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,511
He had set up a little nonprofit to do the fake shirt factory thing

171
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,327
Now he has his team talk to people in other

172
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Study the rules

173
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
And he figures out

174
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,727
Setting up a shirt factory actually one of the easier things

175
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
If you want permission for a new bus route it takes

176
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
26 months

177
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,407
Open a new legal Market

178
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,735
Kind of place all those Street vendors want to move into that takes

179
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
13 years

180
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
These numbers started to answer.

181
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
If you scrape together enough money to start a live

182
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Little t-shirt

183
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
You got to start selling shirts right away

184
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,791
You can't afford to spend 9 months getting permit

185
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
So you end up doing what everybody does

186
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
You open your factory

187
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Illegally

188
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
You don't wait

189
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
You live outside the

190
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,031
And if you're outside the law DeSoto realizes

191
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
It's really hard to get ahead

192
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
It's really likely that you're going to stay

193
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:50,015
If you're running your business legally if you don't have a bank account you're not going to get a loan to expand your

194
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Business

195
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
You can't start a company

196
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
You can't breathe

197
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Capital

198
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,951
And if you can't reschedule you can you also use it for the same reasons you can't raise credit

199
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:03,839
It means you can't expand or you'd also means another thing you can't own things like a brand

200
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,447
I can't do anything that you got I can't don't know Branson or nothing

201
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
It means

202
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
The world before the rule of law

203
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
DeSoto had found his invisible

204
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Unfortunately

205
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
It was one of those problems that

206
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Really hard

207
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
You talking about

208
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Trying to fix in the

209
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
Tire dysfunctional

210
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,575
Trying to change laws trying to change the culture of it

211
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Tire country

212
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
Facebook this Monumental task

213
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
DeSoto decides on the thing he knows

214
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
He's a business

215
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
So cute lunches Ann Adkins

216
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,375
You put up a lot of radio Jingles a lot of TV jingles

217
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
Jingles like ads like

218
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,983
Too hard to start a business

219
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,591
Yes absolutely one of them was called they was one of them is called

220
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:53,759
Jdi yo SI tuviera Capital Galleria

221
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Title of the song

222
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
What would I do if I had tapped

223
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:10,143
The guy says I'm going to tell you the story of a country that's doing really badly

224
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,079
Because only a small group of people has access to

225
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
The capital

226
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,295
Can I give you my honest reaction when you told me that

227
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
Tell me there's no way this week

228
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,927
What does it change your opinion if I tell you that

229
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,999
Badly and capital rhyme in Spanish

230
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
Model capital

231
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,327
Send text message

232
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
Every one of the problems

233
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
Is something you mentioned

234
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,471
In the song right there are small number of people who do have access

235
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
Those people don't want

236
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,591
I mean you've got corrupt officials right

237
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
They all like collecting

238
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,967
You've also got a bunch of rich people who already have businesses their well-connected

239
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
They like the fact that it takes someone else a year to get

240
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
Because it benefits them

241
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
There's so many things set up for the system not

242
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
And on top of all this

243
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
DeSoto has one other prom

244
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,839
The Shining path was a terrorist movement of Peru

245
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,167
Ideologically a mouse movement

246
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
Maoist as in Chairman Mao

247
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
Bees are communist guerrillas

248
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
Was there waging a civil war in the

249
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
And as communist

250
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,711
They have a very different view from DeSoto about what is holding the country back

251
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
For The Shining path

252
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,551
The reason people were poor wasn't these

253
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,111
Obstacles to capitalism that DeSoto had this

254
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,951
For The Shining path the problem was capitalism itself

255
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
DeSoto receive this ideological

256
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
And when he writes a book is part of a

257
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Is Big Marketing

258
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Campaign

259
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
He makes the title

260
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Attack on The Shining

261
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
He calls his book

262
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
The other path

263
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
It becomes a bestseller

264
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:56,639
In the book he describes his findings the fake shirt factory all the facts and ideas about rules and

265
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Businesses in poor people

266
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
And he says what proof poor need is not

267
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
Now is for evolution

268
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,343
Simpler more rational rules to bring poor people into the sea

269
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
The mouse were not

270
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,511
I wake up one day and they say the clandestine newspaper The Shining path

271
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
Says that you were going to be punished

272
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
Because you brought down the recruitment

273
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,215
Because of the of the fuzzy ideas that your propagandizing

274
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:26,079
Whistle Jingles with a book excetera and they're going to punish you that's what I wake up one day

275
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
The attack

276
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Came soon after

277
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
There's a park in front of our offices

278
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,807
And they get into a a dirt mound in front in the back of it and they start machine-gunning the place

279
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,415
Richard security guard and then the attackers pulled a car up in front of the building

280
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
The car that saluted was about my note

281
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
200-300

282
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
50

283
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
Kilos of dynamite

284
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:53,471
And they light the fuse and there's a getaway car they all get it back into the getaway car

285
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
And leave the car to explode

286
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
Three people at desoto's office

287
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:03,711
A while later The Shining path tried again they machine-gunned desoto's car but it was protected by Bulletproof

288
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
Glass and reinforce gas

289
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
Eventually the mouse loss

290
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
The leaders of The Shining path

291
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
And two sodas moment finally

292
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,975
He become famous Jingles on the radio the best-selling

293
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
And he was providing proof of whatever wanted suspected

294
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
For a long time

295
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
No one was playing by the rules

296
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Because the rules were made

297
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Rules needed me

298
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,519
DeSoto get the ear of Peru's president

299
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,847
And the president launches a campaign to simplify the rules

300
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
To make it

301
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Easier for

302
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
Poor people to get title to their homes

303
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
Legal ownership of their bid

304
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
To accomplish this disorder need more than

305
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Clever radio

306
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
Penny the TV show

307
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
So they want

308
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,439
The TV show about cutting through bureaucratic red

309
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Starring

310
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
The president of Peru himself

311
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,839
On the show the president hears about the problems people are having problems

312
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Business

313
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Applying for

314
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
University or even

315
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Getting a marriage license

316
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
And then the president actually does something about

317
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Fresno State Building

318
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:05,407
This is terrible and who should know who's ahead of the office that would be ultimately responsible for this and then

319
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,223
My guy would tell him well it is

320
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
Office such-and-such

321
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,319
Okay well if he doesn't solve the next five days he's fired

322
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,183
And then he signs of those decree and then the guy with a nice blue shiny uniform

323
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,279
Takes it into his hand gets on a motorcycle the TV Camera follows in

324
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:26,399
Any delivers it to the public go find who told you that 5-day to solve it so you're basically turning this

325
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,215
This wonky thing you're doing into reality TV

326
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
PS that's it

327
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,079
Yes I never thought of it that way it was reality TV

328
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
And it worked

329
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
It works

330
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,431
The rules in Peru actually got simple

331
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,271
It got easier for a poor people to have a title to their home or not

332
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Start business

333
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
Move into those markets World Avengers

334
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,159
To be clear Peru is still a poor

335
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
And there a couple critiques of

336
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
One is just that

337
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,303
Poverty is more complicated

338
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Then the simple

339
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
The second critique is that

340
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
Changing the rules is great but it doesn't

341
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
Help the poor speech

342
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
People doesn't help that

343
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
The very bottom

344
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,567
Still go people around the world start noticing white DeSoto

345
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,407
After the break how did Soto's ideas spread around the world

346
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,295
Support for this podcast and the following message come from Slack

347
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,135

348

Where every part of work from documents to decisions is stored archived and searchable in second

349
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303

It's slack.com

352
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,007
Wendake DeSoto gets a call from the president of

353
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
He starts hearing from other leaders in Latin America

354
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
In Tanzania

355
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,711
Tanzania in other countries in Africa and Asia this becomes like a big deal

356
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,015
And the World Bank in Washington DC also

357
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
Checking out and thought

358
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
You know maybe there is some way we can apply this stopwatch

359
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
To the whole world to every country

360
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,255
If they didn't do the full on fakefactory experiment

361
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
But they started sending surveys out

362
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,607
The people all over the world and asking

363
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,167
How long does it take to do these really basic

364
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
Mcallen's it take to get a permit

365
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,079
Start your factory how long does it take to fill out your taxes how long does it take to get the electricity

366
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
They call this thing the doing business

367
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,015
They do it every year now and it actually gets a lot more attention than you know you're sort of standard

368
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
Boring World Bank

369
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
And one of the reasons is that they ranked the country

370
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
I'm like best

371
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
2 worst based on

372
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Easter babe

373
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
Enzo people pay attention

374
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,999
You know people love lift like

375
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
US News & World Report rank

376
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,887
Colleges and colleges are always trying to move up a list it is the same with this

377
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,215
Rita ramallo is the head of the World Bank group that puts out the rank

378
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:42,335
Once you start keeping scores people actually start getting competitive and care about

379
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,383
No one wants to be last that's

380
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
Probably

381
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,759
The power rankings lies on that no one wants to be last

382
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
No one wants to be Eritrea

383
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
Eritrea is number

384
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
189 on the list

385
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,415
Get your curious number one is Singapore

386
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Us

387
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
Is number 7

388
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
Countries want to beat out their neighbors

389
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
Government start to worry that a bad showing in the rankings my

390
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
Hurt them with the voters back home

391
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,775
We match with the delegation in their first question was when is the report coming out how does that match with dialect

392
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:18,175
Sometimes

393
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
No not that

394
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,063
Some countries look at the report and decide hey we can use it to her advantage

395
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,367
The Republic of Georgia for example

396
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,439
Used to be part of the Soviet Union it made moving up in the ranking

397
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
Part of the plan to modernize its

398
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Economy

399
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,351
Country shut up from deep in the list to number 15 in just a few years

400
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
They took out ads in the Wall Street Journal in The Economist

401
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
Bragging about how they moved up the list

402
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
Country start reviewing rules that have been on their books for

403
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
In Suriname for instance

404
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,127
Used to take a really long time to

405
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
We're kind of strange

406
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,551
Suriname used to be the longest because you actually had to have permission from the president to

407
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Start a business

408
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,879
President personally had to approve that yes

409
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
But that has changed

410
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Not everybody like the rain

411
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
Labor groups complained a few years back because

412
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,631
When the ways you could move up the rankings was by making it easier in your country to fire workers

413
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
World Bank actually changed

414
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
Rules about 5 workers

415
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
No longer going to the couch

416
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
As for DeSoto

417
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
He's off for the world

418
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,639
I think you're great I think it's great

419
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
He's glad it exists

420
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,479
If you ask him if the world is a better place because

421
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,759
Is the counting of the numbers

422
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
Answers you with them

423
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,599
We've done it in Egypt for a bakery

424
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
548 days

425
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,951
It takes a year to have to open a bakery in Egypt

426
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
It takes a year-and-a-half to open a baker needs

427
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
He's a numbers guy

428
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
Still out there with this

429
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:46,495
Special things today to Michael Klein one of the co-founders of the

430
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,055
The doing business report and Sam shukufuku

431
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
Spend a lot of time in the Republic of Georgia

432
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,991
Russia Today was produced by Jess Jiang and if you're looking for something else to listen to I have good news

433
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,063
Invisibilia is back for season 3

434
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:06,463
This isn't there they're kind of big question is this how can two people look at the exact same thing and see

435
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Be something completely different

436
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,911
You can listen to invisibilia Season 3 starting on June 1st you can find it on the NPR one app or wherever you go
