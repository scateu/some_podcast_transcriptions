1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,424
All right it is that time of your candy canes mistletoe

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,520
Public radio and we heard that there are people outside of our house

3
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,824
The people or is it asked you to

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
Money

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,200
We figured that if anybody knows how to raise money at them so we're going to go get

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,296
Down at that corner

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,088
Chaoyang park

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,880
Why we can't record in the park

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928
We need a permit

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,208
Okay we're leaving

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,512
But I think I see the people with words

12
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,072
3D printer stopping quickly ask them

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,400
Yesco quick hi how you doing

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,728
We work with national public radio across the street

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,264
We're getting kicked out

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,224
Alert to supervisor

17
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
On behalf

00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,392

We prefer big

26

That is donated npr.org Planet Money

27
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
Who's this number

28
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,576
It's probably the most important number in the world

29
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392
This number determines how many people in the US have

30
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,160
Have a job

31
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
It has the power to wipe out our

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Wings account

33
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,560
This delicate fussy little number is the inflation rate

34
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,632
A bunch of what the Federal Reserve does all day is

35
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
Try to get this number just right

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
And for the longest time

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
The Fed

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,800
Didn't want us to know what number they were targeting

39
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,848
But on January 25th

40
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
2012

41
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,176
But then Fed chair Ben Bernanke

42
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
Hold Us

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
The committee judges that inflation at the rate of

44
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
2%

45
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
Ben Bernanke said the FED had in it

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Explicit goal of

47
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Keeping busy

48
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Powerful number at

49
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
2 /

50
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,280
This was a huge shift in American economics

51
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
And we've actually talked about this one planet money but

52
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:16,960
Google we didn't know at the time was that this big bombshell announcement

53
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
With the end of a mud

54
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,056
Longer story that starts

55
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,104
On a tiny Island full of

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
Kiwis and Hobbit

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,320

Secret history of 2%

60

We take you on a trip around the world to just about the farthest place from the United States

61
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:45,376
And we find the true origin story behind the most important number in the world

62
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
And when we get back

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,032
Find out that we might have just spent the last 22 years

64
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,592
Targeting the wrong number

The whole reason Ben Bernanke told us that the US was

80
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
Targeting inflation

81
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Was because

82
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
One guy in New Zealand

83
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
Decades earlier

84
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,440
Proven that sharing your economic secrets

85
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
A good thing

86
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
His name

87
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,000
Is Arthur Grimes

88
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,840
Arthur completely reimagined the role of central bankers

89
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
Change the way whole countries

90
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Keep their economies

91
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Stable

92
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
He's one of the most

93
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Important economist

94
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
In the world

95
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
How do you think New zealanders View you

96
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
Mayport Naval Academy

97
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
That's one

98
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:05,760
Are there used to be the chief Economist and New Zealand Central Bank he is a current professor of Welby

99
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,344
Weight flake well-being like we're happy

Disease children smiling in Prague

101
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,976
Economic well-being and he's a jazz musician

102
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,280
Saxophone player tenor saxophone

103
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
Yeah NHL going to do I called you awfully

104
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
You like that his neck

105
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
You got to go.

106
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
So what else would we

107
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,519
For most of Arthur's life New Zealand had massive inflation

108
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Richmond prices were going up

109
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
And everyone's money was

110
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
Losing value

111
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,967
This can happen when there's too much money floating around an economy and everyone tries to

112
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
Suspended on not enough

113
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Stuff

114
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
And the government had tried everything

115
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Thing to lower it

116
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
For nearly two decades

117
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
There were

118
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
Harley

119
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,279
Days Days the government didn't let you drive your car to try to stop gas prices

120
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
I'm going up

121
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,631
There's a Time the government banned businesses from Raising

122
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
Prices for a year

123
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,471
I finally they turn to Arthur they say

124
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
You're a smart economist

125
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
You go find a way to fix

126
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
Let's go see what other country

127
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
And around 9

128
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Five nights

129
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,687
6 they sent Arthur on a

130
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
A trip around the world

131
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,319
When you're in a small country that's on the other side of the world from visually everywhere

132
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,159
It's just natural for us to actually see what other people do

133
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:21,535
How do other people do these things with a bunch of smart people in the US

134
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
UK Germany Canada

135
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
We all have different methods for controlling info

136
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,727
Some central banks have a monetary Supply Target witch

137
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,775
Just means they're capping how much money is

138
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
Is printed every year

139
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Others have it

140
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
Unemployment Target

141
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,687
The perfect amount of people with jobs for the healthiest economy

142
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
And some have an interest rate target

143
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,575
They're trying to pin down what's the right interest rate for loans

144
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
But all these targets

145
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
Were aimed at

146
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
Keeping inflation low

147
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
There are three things

148
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
Why not just cut to the chase

149
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
Fixed I get the ultimate goal which is inflation

150
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
Happytime inflation-targeting

151
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Inflation targeting

152
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,263
Set an ideal level of inflation and drive the economy toward that

153
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
Central Bank three years to develop

154
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
This whole new system

155
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,687
The people had talked about inflation targeting before right

156
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,063
It was only after that after you seen it done it that

157
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
That Tim was actually invented

158
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,671
You invented inflation-targeting

159
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,839
So the government says okay Central Bank give us a number so we can hold you accountable

160
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,655
Inflation is at 9% right now

161
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
What should we do

162
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,263
Arthur says I'm not going to give you a number I will give you a ring

163
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
022 by 92

164
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
022 by 92

165
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,015
0 to 2% inflation by 1990

166
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
This was the

167
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
Here's the thinking behind this

168
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Aside from it being

169
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Catchy

170
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,207
If you have 0% inflation that is

171
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
True absolute

172
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Price to build

173
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
The price of carrots sugar your rent

174
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Never change

175
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,679
If you have 1% inflation that means that the price of carrots

176
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
Goes up by 1%

177
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
But you're not

178
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,871
Skipping meals over this you just buy turnips instead of tariffs now 1% inflation doesn't affect your wealth

179
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,687
So Economist in New Zealand considered

180
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
1% inflation kind of like neutral in place

181
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
And then Arthur sink

182
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,623
We need some wiggle room and so he says let's give ourselves

183
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
Plus or minus 1 /

184
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
So that's how they got

185
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
0 to 2

186
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
But

187
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
They knew that reaching this target

188
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Would be

189
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
Much easier said

190
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,679
What was that experience

191
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,983
Tips and advice and we'd all be brought up with

192
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Double-digit inflation

193
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Minos was considered

194
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,591
Extremely difficult

195
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Get stupid

196
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:50,015
New Zealand was going to dramatically forced inflation down from 9% to under 2

197
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,855
And having low inflation like 2% that's good

198
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
But the process of

199
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Bringing it down

200
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
That hurts people

201
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
It is a painful process

202
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,839
And if they were going to meet their target they needed someone who could say

203
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,655
I don't care what happens to people while we

204
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Deflate

205
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,519
We're doing this and we're not looking back they chose a guy

206
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
Appropriately named Don

207
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Brash

208
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,871
I don't hear

209
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
This is Don brash

210
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,479
I had to portray myself as someone who didn't give a fig

211
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,807
You had to present yourself as someone who didn't give a

212
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Fig

213
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
That's what I said

214
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
This is for the American expression which is

215
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
More than you want to include

216
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Done

217
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Job was to

218
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
To force the inflation rate

219
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,119
He did it by restricting how much money regular Banks

220
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
Had in their vault

221
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
Which affects how much money everyone has

222
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
That was the easy part he literally just had to

223
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
Snap to make it happen

224
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
But that

225
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Easy thing

226
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:46,847
What causes

227
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Huge spike in unemployment

228
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,943
At the time inflation was really high

229
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
So people needed Highway jinx

230
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Reese's just a break

231
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,111
I'm done is telling people those wage increases you need

232
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
They're going to make unemployment

233
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
Last longer but you can help shorten this pay

234
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
If you just believe me

235
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:10,911
We have a little faith start acting like inflation is already at 2% and we will get to 2%

236
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,495
Pastor he was basically Newzealand Smokey the Bear

237
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
Only you

238
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Can prevent long-term unemployment

239
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,383
So you're going around New Zealand telling workers

240
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Listen

241
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
I know that inflation is almost

242
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
6% right now

243
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
But trust me

244
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,367
I'm going to bring it down so just don't ask for a 6

245
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Percent

246
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
Wage increase in your salary

247
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
That's what you're doing

248
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
That that's roughly what I'm doing and then you're also going to businesses in

249
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Something business is

250
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
If we know the inflation rate is almost 6%

251
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,471
But we're going to bring it down to just don't charge more for your good

252
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
That's right that's right

253
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
But nobody

254
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
Employees

255
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Keep asking for highways

256
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Because even though

257
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
I believe they don't need them any

258
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,735
And companies are continuing to give them

259
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
Because the employees are demanding

260
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
And so companies now

261
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
Cannot afford to pay everyone at such high

262
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
So

263
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
They label

264
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
People off

265
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
More people off

266
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
Unemployment goes up past

267
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,399
11% one in nine people who wanted to work

268
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Couldn't

269
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
Well it didn't look good at all and I love you for that very bad and I was just concerned about

270
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
Is anybody else believe it or not

271
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,687
When you have to be hopeful miserable so-and-so not to care

272
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
And it wasn't all on

273
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,807
The government was also announcing all kinds of other reforms

274
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
At the same time like they were privatizing public company

275
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
So there were a bunch of

276
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
And if New Zealand had some old

277
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,047
Stop the running the central bank they might have been like

278
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
Wow this is

279
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
Is getting really bad maybe we should

280
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
Stop where

281
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
Creating a terrible recession

282
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
But not

283
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
John

284
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Don is like

285
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,591
Too bad we can't back out now even if it means

286
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Will Cipher

287
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
People like

288
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Sue Radford

289
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Sue

290
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,735
Glad and unemployed workers

291
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,295
And they decided to rush

292
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
Dance Central

293
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,207
But which obviously expecting us so it was pretty easy we just ran through

294
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Chase Bank

295
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
But it does have security because

296
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,375
Yeah cuz it was a bank the doors locked behind them

297
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,239
Sue hung up banners across the windows and sat on the floor of the main room

298
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
Waiting for Dawn

299
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,591
Until police dragged her out and throw her in a cell

300
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
What was the charge

301
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Remember

302
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,503
Artist to look at my record for children live with me

303
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,343
I have an expensive record for projections

304
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
The next day's sugata

305
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,439
A phone call from Don Brash adhesive

306
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
I hit you came to visit Asia

307
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
Yesterday and I said yes and he said well

308
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,631
Courtyard to come and find out why you were purchased and why you walk

309
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Depart the bank

310
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Intoeing Watertown

311
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
To come

312
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
To Oakland

313
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
We're up at Edward was

314
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,823
They just wanted to convince Diane to

315
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Ease up

316
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
A little bit

317
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
I was a co-parent

318
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
African babies

319
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,551
Living on welfare and trying to get a job at 5 I so did anything change after

320
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
Don Brash met with you

321
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,183
Of course not done with supposed to get inflation between

322
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
0 +

323
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
When to buy 1992

324
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,607
And sure enough we retrieved learning by Naughty to we actually achieved it by naughty one

325
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,399
Which of the Lodi then then plan

326
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
And there were people who said look

327
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
But getting there early

328
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
You have subject

329
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
To the real economy to more pressure than you needed to do

330
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
And it was

331
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
How did people feel about you in New Zealand

332
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,319
Vary greatly depending on

333
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
Known people hated him

334
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,975
Even though inflation went down unemployment was still high

335
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
Estate High

336
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
Even today people still have issues

337
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Baton

338
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,703
Impart also because he said some controversial things about the indigenous population in New

339
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
But he did

340
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,823
Lower inflation in this new way that no one ever had

341
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Before

342
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
And yes there were still problems but a

343
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,967
Economist understood the logic behind inflation

344
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Marketing

345
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
And the world's biggest economies

346
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
They start following in this tiny countries with step

347
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
They announce inflation Target

348
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
Of Their Own

349
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
Canada first

350
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
UK the

351
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,303
Australia they all chose different ranges

352
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
Is and they all

353
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
Told their status

354
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,631
Is just a done did

355
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
But here in the United States

356
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
It went a little

357
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
What happened was

358
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
Really rather strange

359
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
This is Sebastian mallaby

360
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
She is the person who uncovered

361
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
The bizarre way that the

362
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
The feds settled on 2%

363
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
It happened at this one Central Bankers meeting

364
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,367
And we have prepared a dramatic Recreation of this meeting

365
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
We have the transcripts

366
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
Which we have slightly sweet For Your Entertainment

367
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,047
It is the summer of 1996

368
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
The FED is considering whether they should Target in place

369
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
Like all the other cool countries have

370
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
And Janet Yellen

371
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,751
A central bank Governor at the time says

372
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
Bringing inflation down

373
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
20% sounds good

374
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,127
2% very likely is a good idea

375
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
Not surely

376
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
And men being men sometimes were like

377
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,599
Enter meeting moves on and then later one guy goes

378
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,671
Maybe someone else already suggested this but I

379
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
We have the best IDE

380
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
Why don't we have a

381
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
2% Target

382
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,399
This is the most progress we've made in over a decade

383
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
And like every woman at

384
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
It's a meeting in their life Janet Yellen is probably

385
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
Sitting there thinking

386
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
I said that

387
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Earlier

388
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,151
And then Alan Greenspan the Fed chair

389
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
At the time it's like

390
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Weight Janet

391
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
You say that

392
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
That is what I say

393
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
But you've all been talking

394
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
This whole time that was

395
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,415
That's about 30 seconds they do consider a

396
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
Different inflation Target

397
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
What about zero

398
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
Let's do 2

399
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
Is Zero's basically two

400
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,119
This is of course a major economic.

401
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,191
Decision but after that Greenspan just says

402
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
Quote can we leave it at that

403
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
Let us now move on

404
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
It's almost like

405
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,359
They didn't come up with it this is Sebastian mallaby

406
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
The one who

407
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Surface the trance

408
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
They just kind of

409
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Landed on it

410
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
By some Quirk of how the conversation

411
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,647
I'm flattered I thought that was the most extraordinary way made this

412
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Epochal decision

413
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
This decision was

414
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Huge

415
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,047
And Alan Greenspan started getting nervous

416
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
So the next day he

417
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
Came back into the room and he said

418
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,703
That big thing that we decided yesterday

419
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
How about what's not telling you

420
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
He said

421
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
I will tell you that if

422
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,591
2% inflation figure

423
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Get out of this

424
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Run

425
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,479
It is going to create more problems for us than I think any of you

426
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Mercante

427
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
So the US has this

428
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,903
Ballistic Target to devalue our currency by 2% every year

429
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
And they weren't telling us

430
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,767
And there was a second When Alan Greenspan thought

431
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Is this

432
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,583
Fraud against the saving public

433
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
He said

434
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:10,495
You know if we have 2% is out Target we're centrally taking 2% of people's savings away

435
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
Every year

436
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,359
And she made this might come and he said that

437
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,455
We just have to make out dollar bills smaller and smaller every year

438
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
To reflect the loss of purchasing power

439
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,087
Okay so he's being tongue-in-cheek there but the point is

440
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
The US is

441
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
Keeping this

442
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Secret

443
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
And Sebastian says

444
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Doesn't make any sense

445
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,511
Because remember what we learned from New Zealand

446
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,071
Telling people that you're going to force him

447
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Inflation down is

448
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
Heart of how you

449
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
You achieve it

450
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,215
It's like that movie dr. Strangelove

451
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,799
Dr. Strangelove is a movie about a defense scientist

452
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
Laying out the logic of nuke

453
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Nuclear deterrence

454
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
He says

455
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,943
The whole point of the Doomsday Machine

456
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
If not

457
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
If you keep it a secret

458
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
And of course what do you mean

459
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Is that

460
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
If you want it the time

461
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
Your enemy from attacking you

462
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
You've got to tell them that you've dropped

463
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Devastating weapon

464
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,839
To not announce your inflation Target undermines the whole

465
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Queen airbed

466
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,423
But the reason the US Capitol

467
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,447
The secret was

468
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
So that they could

469
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Change their mind

470
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
At any time

471
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
And they gave themselves no deadlines

472
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
To reach their target

473
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,615
So it was

474
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
Far less risk

475
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,247
Also the US was almost at 2% inflation already

476
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
It was not a shock

477
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
To our economy

478
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,647
So Sebastian says the main question this secret meeting raises is

479
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Y2K

480
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
There's no

481
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
Magical logic

482
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
That justifies

483
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,607
2% more than 1% or 3%

484
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,679
And yet we made it kind of fetish for this 2% Target

485
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Way I scherzo proportion

486
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,823
To the logic that was deployed at the time when

487
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
With fast brace

488
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,687
And by Logic he means lack of logic

489
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,503
Alan Greenspan never announced his

490
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Secret inflation Target

491
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,343
It was Ben Bernanke who announced it in

492
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
2012

493
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
And

494
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
It might not even be the right number

495
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
Valerie Wilson is an economist at the

496
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
Economic policy in

497
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,375
Institute and she says there's no reason our inflation Target

498
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,167
Should also be a number that we can

499
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,703
Never ever cross

500
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,263
You know a Target doesn't necessarily mean it has

501
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
To be a ceiling

502
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
The 2% Target

503
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Should you could you

504
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:27,199
Just be staying average she thinks the US should have a ring

505
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,759
Not one explicit number of rain

506
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
Looks like New Zealand

507
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,111
Some Economist say 2% inflation that's just

508
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,903
Too low to get us out of a baddie

509
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,951
Economic situation like a recession

510
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,791
They say a three or 4% Target would give us more wiggle room

511
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
But Valerie says she

512
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
Does not think that it's likely the US will raise

513
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Because

514
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,727
Keeping it low benefits

515
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Some people

516
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
A higher inflation Target

517
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
Benefits

518
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,383
Borrowers who tend to be those with

519
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Less income

520
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,967
On the other side of that those

521
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,783
With higher income and greater well 2

522
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Are the lenders

523
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,367
Your would not necessarily

524
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,439
Want to raise the inflation Target the US

525
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
Has been targeting the egg

526
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
Exact same number since 1990s

527
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
And Valerie says

528
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,399
That doesn't make sense our economy and the world

529
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
Totally different now we should

530
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,495
Evolved other countries have New Zealand

531
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,079
Their original Target was 0 to 2 and they quickly raise it

532
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
2023

533
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
And now the target is one to 3%

534
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
Remember Arthur Grimes

535
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,575
The jazz musician econ PhD who invented inflation-targeting

536
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
He likes

537
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
The original 2

538
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
2% Target

539
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
No I like on the 2% that's what we started after all

540
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,999
This is Arthur
