00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,040
The University of Michigan play Michigan State

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:27,648
In football what is an awesome sight 70,000 fans are in the stadium

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,464
Collectively they paid millions of dollars for tickets

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,024
The game is being broadcast around the car

10
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
On ABC

11
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:40,448

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,904
According to USA Today

21
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,464
Which is a lot of money $2000000

22
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,512
Unless you're the coach on the other side

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,096
For Brady Hoke the coaches on the hot seat

24
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,168
And it is a very nice seat because coach Houk

25
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
University of Michigan

26
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,240
Made up of four million dollars

27
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,824
University Michigan players they are all wearing Adidas

28
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
Shoes

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,384
Not because they're so comfortable

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,248
Or so awesome but because the University of Michigan is in the middle of a multi-year deal with Adidas

31
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,272
Is worth a reported

32
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,552
80 million dollars

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,368
All these millions of dollars

34
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:35,488
From the ticket sales from the TV contracts for the coaches salaries the shoe deals

35
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,560
All this money changes hands and what is basically a free mod

36
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,168
Universities can pay coaches as much as they want or as little as they want

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:49,056
School can cut deals with any shoe company they want or they can decide they're not going to cut any shoe deal at all

38
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,104
But the people who are wearing the shoes

39
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
The athletes on the field

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,688
The ones were crashing violently into one another

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
Turn the looks like he's limping a little bit as he had to pack today these guys

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
Or not

43
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,720
A long time ago a bunch of colleges got together and agreed not

44
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
To pay their college

45
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Fellowships Roque

46
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,096
But anything beyond that is against the rules

47
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
The NCAA

48
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Which oversees

49
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,728
Everybody who watches college sports has an opinion

50
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
About this role

51
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
Opinion about

52
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Fiero

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
What's morally right or what

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,384
What's best for the athletes but we're different question

55
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
Is this legal

56
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
In most Industries if a bunch of different companies got together and decided hey we're going to cap wages it would be against

57
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
What's the lot call the cartel

58
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392
And the government would put a stop to

59
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
So

60
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,488
Is the NCAA an illegal cartel

61
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,816
Or is there something special about college sports that makes a difference

62
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,632
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm taking bolts

And I'm Robert Smith

00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,240
This is not some idle question that we cooked up sitting around the office

65
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,080
In the past few years College athlete has started suing the NCAA

66
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
Saying we should be paid

67
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
We should get to share in the profit

69
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
The legal question

70
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
Should the free market come to college

The face of these lawsuits is a guy named Eric Bana

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,232
Ed O'Bannon is a former college basketball player and he got involved with this whole thing really buy a quince

80
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
A few years ago

81
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
Bannon says

83
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,096
We're playing catch

00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,888
Football out in the front yard and

85

Last night my kid was playing video game you want to check it out you know you're on it

87
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
Your honor

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,152
As in you Ed O'Bannon are one of the characters in this basketball video game

89
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
Obama was a star forward at UCLA

90
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
In 1995 his senior year

91
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,808
The team won a national championship

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,136
Sports Illustrated put a shot of O'Bannon write on the cover

93
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
And that was

94
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,208
Pretty much Ed O'Bannon speak

95
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
As a basketball

96
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,815
I played two years in a row in NBA

97
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
It didn't go well

98
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
Play in Europe for a while

99
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,471
By the time his friend tells him he's in a video game O'Bannon is living near Las Vegas

100
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
Selling cars at a local Toyota.

101
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
Yes sir I'm going to see myself in a

102
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,919
Video game penis pain go inside kid blows up the game

103
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,199
NCAA

104
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
And O'Bannon fees

105
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
He's a video game version of his

106
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
22 year old self

107
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
The game doesn't use his name

108
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,903
But everything else about the video Ed O'Bannon

109
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,023
That was you know 680 225 lb

110
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:54,143
You know the guy was bald-headed left-handed third number 31 Jersey

111
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
And I was like you know

112
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,775
That is me I can't believe I'm on this video game

113
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
I was pretty fired up you know I was excited I mean

114
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Who wouldn't be excited

115
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
To see themselves on a video game

116
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
How are you in the video game

117
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
It was the video Ed O'Bannon

118
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
As good as the real little Banner

119
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Good question

120
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:18,207
He was that day back was better I got to be honest

121
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,303
And then it just kind of a joking way o'bannon's friend point something out

122
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
While he's playing

123
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
You know my friend he says

124
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,191
What's crazy about this is

125
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
You know we paid

126
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,079
I don't know how dollars or whatever for the game and you didn't see any of it

127
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,615
You didn't get a dime

128
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
And

129
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
You know when he said it

130
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,783
I felt like I've been kicked

131
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
O'Bannon knew the rules

132
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
When he went to play at UCLA

133
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
He got a scholarship

134
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
And he agreed that

135
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,279
No matter how much money UCLA basketball made he would not get paid

136
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
That's the way college sports of work for a long time

137
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,167
What time will Bannon saw himself in the video game

138
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,215
A lot of people were starting to question

139
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
And not just former athletes

140
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Lawyers

141
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
They said hey

142
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,871
Do something older than the NCAA

143
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
He called the Sherman Antitrust Act

144
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
Passed away back in 1890

145
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
And right there

146
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
Infection what it says

147
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
A conspiracy

148
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
In Restraint of trade

149
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,879
Is declared to be illegal

150
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:24,511
It's antitrust law that says it would be illegal for Coke and Pepsi to get together and agree that

151
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,839
Play Paul cans of Coke and Pepsi will henceforth cost

152
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
$3 each

153
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,191
For that matter to the illegal for them to get together and say

154
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:36,287
We're tired of competing against each other to hire the best workers the best whatever

155
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Soda in

156
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,639
So we're going to agree to cap wages for all soda engine

157
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
That would definitely be illegal

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
Now sports leagues are kind of weird animals

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,879
Almost a hundred years ago the Supreme Court said that professional baseball was exempt from federal antitrust

160
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,743
Gary Roberts an expert in antitrust law in Sports Indiana University

161
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Told us

162
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
For a sports League to exist at all

163
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
The different business

164
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
This is the team

165
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
They really have to get together

166
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,191
They have to make agreement

167
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,007
All of the teams have to agree on

168
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,639
What teams are going to be in the league where they're going to play what times are going to play

169
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
What are we going to charge for the tickets

170
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
When we play each other

171
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
Are we going to have the game on television

172
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
You can't have the product

173
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Unless

174
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
You have agreement

175
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,719
And over the years courts have explicitly recognize that these kind of agreements

176
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Are good for

177
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Good for fan

178
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
That's because

179
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
Fans really like sports League

180
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
They don't have anything to watch without him

181
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:38,495

So no one questioned it when the NCAA was formed to regulate college sports

184
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Make some rules for everyone

185
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
But in the past few decades

186
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,527
The NCAA started changing in this basic way

187
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
Money started pouring in

188
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,391
One of the big reasons all that money started coming in

189
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Is this guy

190
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
My life change

191
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Change when I

192
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Took a job with Nike

193
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
India

194
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
19 West 7778

195
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Sonny Vaccaro

196
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,727
Remember that 80 million dollar University of Michigan shoe deal

197
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
We mentioned at the beginning of the show

198
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
The car was the first guy

199
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,103
To bring that kind of sponsorship deal to occur

200
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
It started back in the 70

201
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
College

202
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,503
And Beckham college basketball was not much of a business

203
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,343
Coaches even a big schools were making around $50,000 a year

204
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:31,231
Keras basically driving around in a rental car saying the coaches hate if your team wears are shoes

205
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
We'll pay you a few thousand dollars

206
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
And I went to Nike and I

207
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
Do you want to sell shoes I'll tell you

208
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,399
South shoes paid college coaches

209
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
Give them the shoes for nothing

210
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,567
People shiting their fan base will see it no buy your product and that basically

211
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
The Genesis of the whole

212
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
The whole scene

213
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,735
This is totally above board by the way is not violating any rules

214
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:58,111
And not surprisingly lots of coaches are happy to take money until their players to wear Nikes

215
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
By the 80s

216
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Everybody was paying School

217
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,791
Reebok got into it Adidas got into a conference got into it

218
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
Michaela starts cutting million-dollar

219
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
Outfit whole University athletic department

220
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Nike

221
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,983
More and more money pours into college sports

222
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
Everything's fine with this

223
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,079
Keep working the shoe business making these deals

224
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
But there's one thing two

225
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Does bug

226
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
The college players not getting any of them

227
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
Finally in 2007

228
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Sonny Vaccaro camp

229
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Picatinny

230
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
Quit his job

231
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
He basically becomes

232
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
An activist

233
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,951
Start spending his time telling anyone will listen

234
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
It schools

235
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,279
Really should be allowed to pay off

236
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
Eventually a big-time Law Firm

237
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Disinterest

238
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
They might be able to file a lawsuit

239
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
But they need players

240
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Penny plant

241
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
And sunny is the guy with the Kinect

242
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
So he starts making calls

243
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
I went down my list

244
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
I said okay

245
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
List all disk

246
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
And I talked

247
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
Everybody was enthusiastic

248
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
But no one said yes

249
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,903
They were afraid of maybe they couldn't go back to their University maybe they'll be their names we taking down from the wall fan

250
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,719
They're afraid they couldn't get a job in coaching

251
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
This thing was hard

252
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,327
Got it dude wants to do

253
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,167
What Dad sue the NCAA always likes doing the church

254
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
Uterus has given calls metal band

255
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
Former UCLA basketball

256
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,335
Open says that's interesting but doesn't sign on

257
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,919
A while later though after the video game thing O'Bannon calls

258
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
And Eddie simister Carol

259
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,295
I just saw my face on EA Sports

260
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,343
The game and I was at my friend's house last night

261
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,439
That thing you were talking to me about this court case black pasta lawyers

262
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,487
Anna's God is my judge

263
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
That's how it happened

264
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,071
Eddie O'Bannon called me

265
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Felt he was wrong

266
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
And wanted to talk to somebody

267
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
In 2009

268
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
The cases filed in Federal

269
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
Ed O'Bannon vs the NCAA

270
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
And the judge decide

271
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
This is not an open and shut case

272
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
It goes to trial

273
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,687
And as it often happens with lawsuits

274
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:04,063
This particular case was not some broad giant challenge to the whole concept of amateur sports

275
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
This case was strictly Limited

276
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,463
In court o'bannon's lawyer said colleges should be allowed to pay athletes

277
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
Who appear in video game

278
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
Score on TV

279
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
Other cases filed in the last year they go further

280
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,423
They argue that school should be allowed to straight up pay athletes

281
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
The place

282
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
Yeah and all the cases make the same

283
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Basic

284
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,127
They say under antitrust law each school should be able to decide if

285
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,431
If it wants to pay its players or not and

286
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Players should be able to choose

287
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
Schools that offer them

288
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
Better deals more money

289
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
More benefit

290
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
Yeah just like workers

291
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
In any other end

292
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
But

293
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
But

294
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
Antitrust law is not just

295
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
About work

296
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
It's also about consumers

297
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,863
Remember when we brought up earlier in the show

298
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
Hypothetical

299
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,215
Coke and Pepsi colluding to charge $3 a can

300
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
That would clearly harm consumers

301
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
And that's why it's illegal

302
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,383
When the NCAA went to court in your van in case they argue

303
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
This ban on paper

304
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
For college athletes

305
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
It doesn't hurt

306
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
The fan

307
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
It doesn't hurt the concealed

308
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
In fact

309
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
The NCAA said

310
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
This is

311
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Good for

312
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Think about this way

313
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
If you decide to go see a football game

314
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
You have a choice

315
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
You can watch an NFL game on Sunday the best

316
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
The planet

317
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Professionals at the peak of their careers

318
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,215
Or you can go see college game on Saturday also fun

319
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
But they're amateurs

320
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
The kids

321
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
People who are not Pros who are not getting

322
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,199
The NCAA argues that it is good for consumers to have these two very different choice

323
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
These two very different products

324
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
The pros

325
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Any amateurs

326
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,391
The NCAA says this hope not paying players thing

327
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,231
This is what fans are coming out for when they come out to watch college football

328
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,303
It's not a flaw in the product it is the product

329
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
Law professor gay Robert sums up the NCAA

330
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,727
If you force us to treat this like a labor market then you're forcing us

331
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
They have professional sports and that's

332
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,615
Denying the consumer the opportunity to have amateur sports

333
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,479
Despite multiple calls and emails the NCAA did not provide anyone to

334
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
The interview

335
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,855
But their argument does have some historical wait in legal search

336
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
A Supreme Court Justice

337
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
John Paul Stevens

338
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Even made this argument back in the 80

339
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
He said yeah

340
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,583
Banning payments to players allows this unique thing

341
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,655
Amateur college sports to exist as we know it

342
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
It means more consumer choice

343
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
It's good for competition

344
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,543
O'Bannon and the other plaintiffs say

345
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,871
College sports have changed a lot since that Supreme Court Justice

346
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
Said that in like an idiot

347
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,735
The games become much more commercial there's so much more money involved

348
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
Advance

349
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,575
Just don't care that much anymore whether players get paid

350
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
What seems like a straightforward legal question

351
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,207
Does the ban on paying college athletes

352
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Violate antitrust law

353
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
The one that turning on this

354
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
Squishy fuzzy issue

355
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
What do fans want

356
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Soap Robert

357
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
You and I to understand this issue

358
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
We went out last Saturday and did a little investigative work

359
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,687
We snuck into a sports bar filled with die-hard University of Michigan fans drinking Coors Light

360
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
About no Coors Light

361
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,807
It's actually a great Michigan Beer Bell's Two Hearted Ale

362
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Of course

363
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,415
Because every TV in the place is playing at Michigan Michigan State game

364
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
Get me referred to at the beginning of the show

365
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,023
So we watch the game along with them talk to fan

366
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,863
At first they seemed to validate the ncaa's legal art

367
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
The fans we talked to

368
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
Did not want college players to be just like the pros

369
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,847
My name is Emily I went to the University of Michigan and graduated in 2013

370
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Would you care if the

371
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,199
Players on the University of Michigan team got paid to play

372
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
Yeah I would because

373
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,367
In my mind someone who plays football for the University of Michigan is getting a

374
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,439
Free diploma with the university Michigan a stamp

375
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
On it which is

376
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
Worth a lot how much

377
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,839
About $80,000 and

378
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,655
Some of us had to pay for that exact stamp

379
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:07,263
My name is Clarence. I went to the University of Michigan and I graduated in 1989

380
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:12,895
Would you care if I the way I just got last week I went up to Michigan game

381
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
I got my first tattoo

382
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
Big block at my my ankle

383
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
Mazel tov

384
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,671
So here's the question

385
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,767
Would you care if college football players got paid to play football

386
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
I don't think I should get paid now

387
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
I think they should get paid later

388
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:39,519
I think the better course of action is to set up some sort of fun afterwards

389
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,335
But when we have to question another way

390
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Got another in

391
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,687
How would you feel if athletes got paid

392
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
But what would you do

393
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
Would you still consume the product

394
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,087
Would you stop coming out to watch the games at the players were getting paid

395
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,183
I wish I could say that I would stop

396
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:02,559
But as a Michigan Wolverine I don't think I could

397
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,655
Even in a way you didn't like how they just started writing checks to sign to sign kids

398
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
Would you still come out and watch the game

399
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
Absolutely because

400
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Tumi

401
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,871
I can divorce the concept of the business of College athletics

402
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,687
I'm actually kind of entertainment value that I get out of

403
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Do that

404
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
That is the argument against

405
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
The NCAA

406
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,879
These fans at least the ones we talked to said if colleges were to pay the players

407
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
They will still bite

408
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
They will still buy The Wolverine hats

409
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
And the Wolverine t-shirts

410
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
And the Wolverines

411
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,863
The judge's ruling in your ban in case came down this

412
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,423
She found in favor of O'Bannon

413
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,007
She said it is a violation of antitrust Law Firm

414
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,055
Colleges to get together and agree

415
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,591
Ecologist cannot pay

416
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
At least when it comes to things like video games

417
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,247
But before College athlete everywhere start rolling out the keg

418
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
Thanks for the victory party

419
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
The judge did have some caviar

420
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,671
She said called sports are indeed

421
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
Different than the pros

422
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,511
It is okay she said for colleges

423
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
Limit the payment

424
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Two players

425
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
She even said a number

426
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
$5,000 a year

427
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
Just like the guy with the tat wanted

428
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,751
The judge said that the money could be held in trust until the players are out

429
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,847
Ed O'Bannon is likely to come out of this whole thing with a few thousand dollars

430
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,639
Mostly to pay him first time in the

431
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,479
But he says he's happy with the judge's decision he's glad the rules are.

432
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:29,087
The bigger question should students be allowed to get a check for playing football or basketball

433
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
That black we decided another

434
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
It was one filed earlier this

435
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,279
It's been three years since we did the show

436
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,863
After the break we will have a quick update of where things stand now

437
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
This message comes from NPR sponsor

438

00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543

What's in your wallet

443
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
Capital One na

444
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
So okay that ruling came down in the O'Bannon case

445
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,159
The NCAA appealed and in 2000

446
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,719
15 to the 9th circuit came out with it

447
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
The appeals court

448
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,863
Overturned the part of the ruling that said colleges could pay student-athletes upped

449
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
The $5,000

450
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
So here we are in 2017

451
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
Student-athletes still do not get

452
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
But the appeals court did say

453
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,103
Schools could offer scholarships that are a little bit more jidenna

454
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
So today

455
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:29,503
Student athletes get scholarships that cover a little bit more they cover not only room and board and tuition

456
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,831
But also things like money to buy clothes and to travel back and forth

457
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Between home and school

458
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
Finally this

459
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,719
Broader questions a big question of paying student-athletes

460
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
It is still alive legal issue

461
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,655
That case that we mentioned at the end of the show the case about paying athletes to play sports

462
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
That case is likely to go to trial

463
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
Is there a cartel in your life

464
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
