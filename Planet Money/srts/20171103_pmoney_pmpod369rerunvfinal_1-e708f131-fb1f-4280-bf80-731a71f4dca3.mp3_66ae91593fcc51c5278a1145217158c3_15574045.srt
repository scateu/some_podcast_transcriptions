Hello everyone good morning

29
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
We're in a gym that's got a wood floor there's a basketball court but we're not at a high school where on a high floor at

30
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432

Hello everyone good morning

35
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,232
Welcome to count high school fed challenge

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,888
About 9 on a Tuesday morning and they're about a hundred kids here from schools in New York and Connecticut and new

37
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
New Jersey

38
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
A lot of blue suits a lot of red ties

39
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,824
These kids they will be competing today to see who can do the best impression of a central bank

40
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,896
We will find out today which of these teenagers

41
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,944
Has the chops to control the USA

42
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,064
Perhaps it will be a kid from the reigning championship team from Montclair New Jersey

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,624
Montclair is a Suburban town outside of New York

44
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
How to play

45
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
You might live if say

46
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
Actually worked

47
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
At the Federal Reserve in New York

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,304
If 30 kids show up at the high school

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
In February to take

50
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
Spot spot

51
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
There were multiple rounds

52
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
The tryouts are School

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Takes a quiet Siri

54
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,264
And have you been practicing since February then

55
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,080
We do like everyday after school for at least

56
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
2 hours like 7

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
Montclair is the team

58
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,784
And they exude so much confidence that they actually refer to eachother as

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
President show and tell

60
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Governor so-and-so

61
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
As if we actually worked at the

62
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,976
Their competitors include the team from Ridgefield Connecticut

63
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
Team also made the finals last year

64
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
And the ritual kids they made nameplates calling themselves

65
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
Governor so-and-so of the Fed

66
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,728
But at the last minute they decided that was a little bit too

67
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,824
It's clear that they are really deep into this world in fact

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
You're so deep

69
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,176
But they've actually started to Central Banking words in ordinary

70
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Moderate

71
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
Moderate relative because you can use relative at any time

72
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:11,488
It's a relatively good answer

73
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,048
Well anchors that's a good one

74
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,400
What's the expected to is also another good measure Quizlet cisse

75
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
Something is expected

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,472
To stabilize for example and then

77
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,776
I think reasonable housing prices are expected

78
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,824
How to stabilize Swan most recent reports

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
It was also on the reports

80
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
6 months ago

81
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
It's really just use words that are just

82
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
Just vague enough

83
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,064
Just get to a point but you know yeah

84
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
All this fed lingo will come in very handy

85
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,720
The team that sounds most like the fat will win this

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
The three parts the

87
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,608
Each team has to diagnose the state of the economy

88
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
They will be using many charts and graphs

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
2

90
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,752
Each team has a what should the FED do

91
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
Should it raise interest rates

92
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Sore keep them low

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
+ 3

94
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,664
The teams will have to answer crafty questions from actual

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
Economist at the Federal Reserve

96
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,016
Basically these kids they want to sound like this

97
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,112
Incoming information suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately

98
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,232
Most committee participants expect economic growth remain moderate overcoming quarters

99
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
And then to pick up gradually

100
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Ben Bernanke

101
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
Chairman of

102
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
The Federal Reserve

103
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
The gold standard

104
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,959
No gold standard jokes at the Fed

105
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
All right

106
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
As a state goes on as the competition

107
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,871
Progresses each of these teams will have to go into a small conference room

108
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,455
And there they will face a Stern panel of judges

109
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
And one by one each member of the team

110
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
Will do their best

111
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Ben Bernanke

112
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,391
Due to significant fact in the job market as well as the lack of Weights pressure

113
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
Inflation expectations ever Madewell anchor

114
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
Turn to page 9

115
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023
This kind of the flags in the pce Trap

116
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,351
Complacent about the headline anchor levels remain soft

117
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
Your your headline prices are up 2.3%

118
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
With court one point nine percent

119
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
Note the use of well-anchored

120
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
This is

121
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,823
Kevin O'Rourke is a member of that Ridgefield team

122
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,639
And you know one of the things that's interesting is

123
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
These kids they are not just

124
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,735
Parroting well-anchored and all the other jargon

125
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,879
Robert you and I will talk to them after their presentation out in the hallway and it's clear they really have

126
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
Solid grasp of the US

127
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
Economy and what the

128
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Bed bug

129
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,255
And what it means for their own lives in this

130
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,815
This becomes clear when they're not doing a Ben Bernanke

131
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,191
Right now the economy is not in a great position but everyone is you know they're holding

132
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:32,799
It is back to 2013-2014 we don't get out of college till 2016 so

133
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,615
We're doing okay right now

134
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:42,271
You're willing to be patient all the high school students here don't need immediate Improvement

135
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
College with a bad economy as long as we get out we have jobs

136
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,463
You must also be biased toward low-interest-rate since you'll be take another look

137
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
Have housing

138
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
Housing prices are really low right now

139
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:59,167
This is exactly the way the mechanics of all this are supposed to work these kids understand it

140
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
The feds

141
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Super low income

142
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
They are supposed to encourage

143
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
People to borrow money so

144
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
If you're about to borrow tens of thousands of dollars to go to college maybe if you're thinking about buying a house after you graduate

145
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
You love blow into

146
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,783
But say you're

147
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
65 years old

148
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,647
You're about to retire and try to live off your savings

149
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,719
You got a bunch of money in a savings account or is bonds

150
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
If you want to be able to live off the entry

151
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
In that case

152
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
Low interest rates are not your

153
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
I love this notion that the Fed

154
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,727
Current policy is the one that would be picked by an eligible teenage

155
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,799
You know it's funny when we talked to the Richfield team

156
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
Actually

157
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,407
Pretty optimistic about the economy for being a young person these days

158
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
But when they try to explain it to their friends

159
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
It doesn't go so well

160
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,367
I'm at think if you talk to the majority of teenagers whom we know they would say all the economy is doing terribly

161
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
So I'm not sure everyone

162
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Pills the same

163
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,791
So when did you have all the stats in a little book right here

164
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
Do you spend all the time playing no it's not as bad as you think

165
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
I mean you have time to argue people but if they don't have like a fundamental knowledge of the indicators it's difficult to discuss with someone

166
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,103
Retail sales look at the car sales figures

167
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
What can consumer sentiment

168
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
What what's

169
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,991
Retail sales

170
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,367
The kids in the competition on the other hand they have thought about the Federal Reserve a lot

171
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:26,463
And when you start thinking about the FED it starts to seem really strange

172
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
This institution that can just

173
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
Create money out of thin air

174
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,887
Richfield Rivals the reigning Champs from Montclair New Jersey

175
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
They got really into the

176
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
This is Amari Shabaka

177
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,031
Montclair one of the really interesting things that we actually

178
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:45,407
Sort of like talked about a couple of nights ago actually was the idea that during the financial crisis to

179
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,967
Provide liquidity in the market the FED actually just

180
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Created the money

181
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
To buy assets

182
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,671
You know the money didn't come from somewhere the FED just created a trillion dollars in the put in the market

183
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,743
And then when it feels like it can take that Chilean dollars and make it disappear

184
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,559
Well he's going to have to get his head around that concept

185
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,607
Pretty damn quick because Montclair

186
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
They made it to the final round of the afternoon

187
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
In Ridgefield fascinated as

188
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,543
So the Challenger and the reigning Champion go into the finals

189
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,407
You thought it was crazy before it is about to get real 15 teams came in in the morning

190
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,223
There are five teams that have made the finals

191
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
They are

192
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
Sequestered off

193
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:30,207
In a secret room somewhere in The Fad I don't actually know where they are and the finals it definitely feel

194
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,303
Like a big deal that the presentations in the morning they were in this little conference room

195
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,143
But the finals are here in this big fancy Auditorium with a

196
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
The stage of the

197
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
The front of my car

198
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,495
Griffin's one team after another comes into the auditory

199
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
They walk up on the stage

200
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
Amy answer questions from the panel of Katakana

201
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Questions like

202
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,431
The Federal Reserve generally Focus

203
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Sazon corn

204
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
Instead of mainly on headliner

205
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
What are the differences

206
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Between these measures

207
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Witchwood

208
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,415
Do your preferred measure

209
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:06,047
Call me call me I know it put your hand down we are going to hear from

210
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
Are Challenger first

211
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
The Richfield team

212
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,935
Biggest and most obvious difference between

213
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
Core and headline inflation

214
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Is headline include

215
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
Energy and oil prices

216
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
Which are very volatile

217
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
And

218
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
Got to seem to change a lot

219
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
Brisk

220
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
Core generally has a more

221
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
Constant trend

222
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
Because it takes out this element of volatility

223
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
And it also includes

224
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Oh it

225
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,791
It sounds like someone had to whisper that word food to

226
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,399
But but it was pretty good and just a restated headline inflation

227
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,727
It's basically a measure of how much all prices are rising

228
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,031
Core inflation is everything

229
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Accept prices for

230
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
Food and energy

231
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
As each of the teams made very

232
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
Clear headline is important because

233
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,759
If the bottom line is it's what you and I pay every month

234
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
What is the problem

235
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
It moves around in the short

236
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,927
We all by oil gasoline or some form of it will prices jump up boom

237
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Headline inflation jumpsuit

238
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
Oil prices fall

239
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
Headline inflation

240
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
If the Fed tried to change its policy

241
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
Every time

242
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
This price of oil changed

243
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
Roosevelt

244
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
It would be a mess

245
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,519
So in the short-term the FED pays more attention to core inflation which

246
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
Tends to be much more steady

247
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
And the Montclair team they did a really good job of explaining

248
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:29,247
But when we see political instability in the Middle East headline

249
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Because oil price

250
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,879
This isn't necessarily a long-term change in inflation

251
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Is subject

252
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
How to change a governor Lane mansion

253
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,743
And so core inflation is definitely

254
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
More accurate tool for judging the

255
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
Long-term increases

256
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
In price

257
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,727
Both teams are hitting just the right note

258
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
Of authoritativeness

259
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,823
And being really boring

260
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
It's so cozy this this week

261
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,943
And we are about to find out who won but Robert first

262
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,271
We have to get to a special Planet Money question that we asked

263
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
Absolutely we had

264
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
Test now

265
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
We all know what they're going to say if we ask them who's your favorite Central Banker the August 8th Ben Bernanke so we wanted to know who is your

266
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Second

267
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Favorite

268
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
Central Bank

269
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,399
I opposed to Katherine gross and Allison Schoenberg from Richfield High

270
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
They took a stab at

271
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Yellow

272
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
Beaches on by the Federal Reserve people and

273
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
Women

274
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:34,015
John she writes speeches in just in a clear logical way and it's it's

275
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,599
Are high school students are able to understand your education

276
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,927
And we really appreciate that Janet Yellen

277
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
Vice chair of the Federal Reserve

278
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
If you are listening to this

279
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,839
The kids love you you are huge in Ridgefield Connecticut

280
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
Now let's go to Montclair

281
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
Who's your second-favorite central Banker

282
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Call Boca

283
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
Good one good one

284
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
Central Bank

285
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,223
Dragon dragons on Hans Weidman

286
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
Weidman is the head of the bundesbank

287
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
Which let me admit I had to look that up

288
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,743
Draghi is Mario draghi the head of the European Central Bank and Paul volcker

289
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
He was chairman of the FED before these kids were born

290
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
You know all the challenges are very good but Montclair

291
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Montclair

292
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
They live

293
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Monetary policy

294
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
Winner

295
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
Is Montclair High School congratulations

296
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,431
And they were very excited it's funny that as soon as this was announced

297
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,247
They look any teenager anywhere who wins the competition

298
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
And they were 17

299
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
The team from which field they got an honorable mention

300
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,207
And listened okay with that I mean someone said they were interested in going into economics and

301
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,047
And they talked about how they're actually angling for internships at the Fed

302
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
That would be the true price

303
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
The shot at becoming

304
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
The central Bankers of

305
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:02,079
Junius brown one of the students on the Ridgefield team he took away from this a concept that I have to say as a Planet Money reporter

306
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Where is is dear to my heart

307
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,479
Typically the more you look at economics the more you realize there's really a lot more going on than YouTube

308
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Expected

309
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
Have you found yourself to be more confused the more you know

310
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:18,975
Samos depends swerve like every every question you find an answer with them with every answer comes another question

311
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Little bit beyond

312
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,655
For that honorable mention Richfield gets a trophy that they can bring back to their school and they said it probably will not go into the

313
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,495
The case with all the sports trophies they said they'll probably keep it in the economics

314
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
Where people are more likely to

315
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
Appreciate it

316
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,735

Hey it's Jacob actually have not one but two updates here for the end of the show

326
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
Update number one is about

327
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
Real fed not the pretend fed

328
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:13,759
Janet yellen's term as chair of the FED expires in February of next

329
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
And just yesterday on Thursday

330
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
President Trump

331
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
Said that he will nominate Jerome

332
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Howell to replace

333
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,279
How was originally appointed to the board of the fed by President Obama

334
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,863
He has consistently voted along with Janet Yellen

335
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
When setting monetary policy

336
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
You seen as a very moderate middle-of-the-road choice

337
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
The head the fat

338
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Update number

339
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
2

340
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
What happened to the kids from the show

341
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
They're all grown up now

342
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Graduated

343
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Recology Eureka

344
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
And we managed to catch up with a few of

345
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,831
We didn't find anybody working or interning at the FED alas that dream did not

346
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Come true

347
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,903
But those we talked to did seem to be

348
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,207
Gainfully employed Kevin O'Rourke

349
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,511
From Ridgefield he was the one who predicted that

350
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
The FED would take care of the economy that

351
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
Graduate into a healthy economy

352
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
That happened that's good

353
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
He works now at pricewaterhousecoopers

354
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
And he talked this week with

355
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,287
Planet money's intern Alice Wilder

356
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,127
He told her he think back fondly on that day at the FED challenge

357
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
But you know not

358
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
That

359
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
What did you do to celebrate

360
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
After that we went back I think we had dinner

361
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,111
There was no like it less at pekin

362
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,159
Fed challenge party that happened

363
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:29,535
Yeah surprisingly not the craziest crowd

364
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
