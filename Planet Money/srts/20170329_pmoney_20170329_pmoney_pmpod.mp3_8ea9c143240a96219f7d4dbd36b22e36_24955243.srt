00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,584
Hey it's Kenny Malone Planet Money correspondent and

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,120
I am a huge

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:05,888
Horror film

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,424
I'm telling you this

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,008
Because it's been fantastic that one of the biggest movies this year

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,032
Is a horror

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,944
Chris was just telling me how you felt much more comfortable with my being you

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,320
Sorry man this movie is indeed called get out

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,112
It was number one at the box office when it

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,136
That came out last month

11
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,976
And it's getting love from virtually every critic out there for being a smart

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,768
Social commentary on race

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,816
And also for being a kick-ass horror

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,144
Get out is already the highest grossing film ever for

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,936
For the production company that made it

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
Blumhouse Productions

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,544
No we first came across them in 2015

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,104
Because our pioneering a new business model for making

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,872
Films

20
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,456
The store you're going to hear was first reported by Stacey Vanek Smith and Steve

21
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
Steve Henn

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
And at the end of the show

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
We talked to Jason Blum the producer

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
About his head

25
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,136
There is one rule

26
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
In Hollywood

27
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,184
Bigger is better

28
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,464
And biggest

29
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,232
Is best

30
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,536
The only example of this you need

31
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
Is a little movie franchise called

32
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
The fast

33
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:14,240
And the Furious railroad crossing up there is exactly a quarter mile away from here

34
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,128
I'm green I'm going for you know those car chase scenes that used to have

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
End movies

36
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,712
Fast and Furious is basically

37
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
Just the car JC that's the full movie part 2

38
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,928
What's right they've made

39
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:38,304
Seven of these movies and altogether they learned 3.9

40
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
Billion dollars

41
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Billion dollars

42
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
The box office

43
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,192
How to say I've always been curious

44
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
What would it be like

45
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
Direct one of these

46
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
Huge big budget

47
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
Phelps

48
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
Lots of fun from the point of view of the filth

49
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,528
All the toys and you have

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
Enough time

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
This is Rob Cohen

52
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
He directed the very first fast and

53
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
He created the series

54
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,232
After directing the Fast and the Furious

55
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
Cohen was the toast of Hollywood

56
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
And everybody was so friendly and so nice and let's have lunch and read this script

57
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
Come to this party yeah but he started getting all of these offers and he got an offer

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
Did you even bigger budget movie

59
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
That's the way it works

60
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
This one was a film called

61
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Dell

62
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,344
Its budget 135 million.

63
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,160
It was like the Fast and the Furious but with

64
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
Fighter jets

65
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
And drones

66
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Instead of cars

67
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
And at one point one of the drums.

68
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
I'm self-aware

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
You put a squadron at risk

70
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Damn straight

71
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
Tin Man did what you did in Rangoon

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
You talk me

73
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,776
This film was

74
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
Total

75
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Disaster

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
It lost

77
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Close to us

78
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
A hundred million dollars

79
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
Everybody was like I had leprosy and the very same people that

80
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,880
We're so nice we're suddenly like

81
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Not

82
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:14,560
You died coming to a restaurant and instead of them popping up and saying come on sit down and join us

83
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
They were like

84
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
Pretending they didn't see me

85
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
And it was that extreme

86
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:26,592
Hear failure is considered a terminal disease that's communicable

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408
For two years Rob Cohen didn't

88
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Park

89
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,736
Then you got a couple jobs but nothing close to

90
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
Before I met someone

91
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
Completely unexpected

92
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
Someone

93
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Really didn't know better

94
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
Walked into his office

95
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
An offer

96
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
This guy was a movie

97
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
And he said

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
I have a different way you can

99
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
Lots of money

100
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Forget the Blockbuster mentality

101
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
Just put that

102
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Out of your mind

103
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
Think small

104
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:59,104

The low-budget movie producer who showed up in Cohen's office

121
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,055
Come told me he was kind of known around town is like a renegade

122
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Crash

123
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,151
But he also happened to be one of the most

124
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
Successful producers of all

125
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
Jason Blum

126
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
Jason Blum

127
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
Don't worry if you haven't heard

128
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:15,647
Heard of him he hasn't won a lot of oscars and students don't study him in film School

129
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,999
When is famous in this industry for getting the most money out of the cheapest

130
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Possible

131
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,863
And when you rank movies by the return-on-investment

132
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
How much money went into making a film

133
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
Compared to how much profit created

134
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,799
Jason mom's name is on six of the top 20 films made in the last

135
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,127
Blum has developed the whole philosophy

136
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
About how to make money

137
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:42,015
Any figured it out when he saw it early cut of this little film

138
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
Called paranormal

139
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
I'm at where operational babe

140
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
Sweet

141
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:53,279
Paranormal Activity is the story of a couple that is trying to record ghosts in their own home

142
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,607
Basically the whole thing looks like a whole movie

143
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
I just want you to know that if things get

144
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:04,543
Thanks for grass or or get worse and anyway I don't want to mess the camera stuff anymore I don't want to make you mad

145
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,359
One for the film and he decided to buy become a producer

146
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Find

147
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,479
And he did this because it was scary but mostly because it was

148
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,295
Cheap Paranormal Activity Cost Less

149
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
Used Toyota Camry

150
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,391
It initially cost $15,000

151
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,023
$15,000 how do you make a movie for $15,000 no crew

152
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,143
So do you have one person and one person does everything Warren and in this case he had his girlfriend and his

153
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
Brandemere there were three of them

154
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
But there was that that was a whole crew there was no sound there was no makeup there was no wardrobe there's no there's no is no one but

155
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,735
Ford fake blood for $15,000

156
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
Where you buy fake but it's $4

157
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,343
Paranormal Activity was basically the

158
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Polar opposite

159
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
Of the fast

160
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:57,023
There were no car chases and explosions no computer-generated monsters

161
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
Nothing

162
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,375
Paranormal Activity made 200 million dollars

163
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,751
It all the film history no film has ever made a bigger return on

164
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
Basketball thinking

165
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
I mean sure not every movie

166
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Could be

167
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Has biggest hit

168
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
Is Paranormal Activity

169
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,199
And you can't really make lots of movies

170
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,783
But what if you created a system that made

171
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Lots

172
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Really cheap

173
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Movies

174
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,415
Meet somebody flops but who cares they're cheap

175
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
And once in awhile you get a little of that

176
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
Paranormal Magic

177
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
A certifiable hit

178
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
And when you did you would make

179
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Fortunate

180
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
Basically looks at films the way

181
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
Adventure capitalist

182
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
Most insulting Valley looks at

183
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
Startups

184
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
He decided

185
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,103
I'm going to make lots and lots of little bits and then what the market

186
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
Figure out who the big

187
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
But to make this work

188
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
Mom had to fight

189
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Every Instinct of

190
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
Every Hollywood director

191
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,367
He had to force them to stop spending money

192
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
Witch's heart

193
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
Because all the kinds of standard Hollywood stuff

194
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
Is just off limits

195
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
Removal of the movie but the climactic scene is a giant explosion to break down a building.

196
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Blippi

197
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:12,799
There was no way to end your movie without seeing the big explosion of a building falling down on screen

198
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Not for us we have to pass

199
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
Airplane crash

200
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,247
Again if you have to see it I can hear someone talk about an airplane crash no problem

201
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:27,647
I can see a burning when no problem I could see rip seats after the fact no problem the actual airplane going down

202
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,231
Not a jet a prop plane we could do

203
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
Car chase through City

204
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
We've done them but they are

205
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,727
Fair they do not look nothing like Fast and Furious I'll tell you that it's a very very

206
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Turkey

207
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Very different version of that

208
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
Mom set up a production company

209
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Blumhouse

210
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,663
And they started to churn Out movie

211
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
Horror movies and thrillers

212
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
And some names you might have heard of

213
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Insidious

214
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Sinister

215
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,159
The Purge and they're also probably films you have never heard

216
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
Like stretch

217
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
Area 51

218
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:08,607
There's really almost no way for you to know they even exist because they were never advertise

219
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
They were never released

220
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
In theaters

221
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,007
About 40% of blum's movies go basically nowhere

222
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Straight to video

223
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Buried in

224
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
40%

225
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,431
Is a lot of movies that's like half of his movies fail

226
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:27,039
That's incredi. This formula right but half are these huge outsized

227
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,343
Hits at least in terms of the return

228
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,927
So this is the man who is totally at peace

229
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
Switch flop

230
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,511
Mr. Auntie big-budget Blockbuster

231
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
And he's approaching Rob Cohen

232
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Mr Blockbuster

233
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,167
The director of The Fast and the Furious

234
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Whose career was

235
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
End of on the skids

236
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
And one says to call in

237
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
Give all that up

238
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
Let's make

239
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
A cheap

240
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Don't remember

241
00:09:53,919 --> 00:10:00,063
All of a sudden they started talk to me about a thriller with Jennifer Lopez the script is called the boy next

242
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,623
It's you know your classic Boy Meets Girl

243
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
Girl falls in lust kind of

244
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
Boy turns out to be a homicidal maniac

245
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
I hate it when that happens

246
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
So common

247
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
But the script wasn't bad

248
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
Cohen would be given creative control

249
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
We get to work with a certifiable movies

250
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
Jennifer Lopez

251
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
JLo

252
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
But there was this one

253
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
His budget

254
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Would be for point

255
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
2 million.

256
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,967
Which probably wouldn't cover my

257
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,367
Catering Budget on the mummy $2000000 sounds like a lot

258
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
But in Hollywood math

259
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
That is low budget

260
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
Cohen said

261
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
Yes

262
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,071
And he approached making the movie almost like a game

263
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
You're going to have to be clever

264
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,983
And that cleverness stretches you and makes you think outside the box

265
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
Because the money

266
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Panacea

267
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
Isn't in Your Arsenal anymore

268
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
You have to fix the problems another way

269
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,783
And so began the re-education of a big butt

270
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Jason blumhouse

271
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Low budget

272
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
Movie making

273
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
He has a series

274
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:17,375
I give you the three rules of how to make a cheap movie

275
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
There is a difference

276
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
Pay scale for people who speak

277
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
In the movie

278
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
And people who don't

279
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
Extras or Union

280
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
Van extras paid

281
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,895
I think I paid 80 or $900 a day

282
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,735
And the funny thing is of an extra speaks you have to pay an additional $400

283
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,391
So you'll notice and not just in our movies with that played our movies too like when the waiter doesn't say anything or like this

284
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
Post office clerk doesn't say anything

285
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:46,303
There's a reason cuz as soon as they do say something you got to get my check for 500 bucks so you don't want extra

286
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
Talk is it really cost

287
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,911
Dementors rule number two not to many locations

288
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
The most economical

289
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:59,359
Way to shoot a movie location wisest have it take place all inside of house and you'll notice a lot of our movies in fact too but I

290
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
I would also say

291
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,431
That that's where you're most vulnerable

292
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,991
Right couch your house and you think you're protected

293
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
You know except

294
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
When there's a ghost who possessed

295
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
Does your girlfriend

296
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Or your boyfriend

297
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
The psychopathic

298
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
Exception and there is rule number three

299
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
This is probably the most

300
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
And it's that stars directors producers

301
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
All of your

302
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Talent

303
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,727
You pay them as little as it is legally possible

304
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
To pay them

305
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,311
When you work on one of his movies you're not really in a

306
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Employee

307
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
More like an investor

308
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Partner

309
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
If the movie profits

310
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
You prob

311
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
So what we do is

312
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
We have box of us bonuses

313
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,135
So if you're if you have made $1000000 on a movie

314
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
In the last 2 years upfront

315
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
I say to you if the movie makes x amount of money we're going to get you to your million dollars if it make it beyond that will get you

316
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
You more than a million dollars

317
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,423
The movie the boy next door was designed

318
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
With these three rules

319
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
In mind

320
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,263
There are barely any extras

321
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,919
There's a dance scene in the movie and you're like looking around your like other people if it's this dance where is everybody

322
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
Also guessing most of them don't speak

323
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,807
I don't think there's an extra in the entire movie who says

324
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,415
Also the movie mostly takes place in a house and a school

325
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
To place

326
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
And

327
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,559
Jennifer Lopez and Rod Cohen or working for the minimum legal salary

328
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
They're getting equity in the

329
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
They get an ownership

330
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,959
But if the movie flops they Will Arnett

331
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,543
It's it's definitely

332
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,103
I gamble because it was like

333
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:41,247
Tighten the belt for the better part of a year because the cash upfront was idiotic

334
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,807
What is Rob Cohen starts mapping out the budget

335
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
For this movie

336
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Deciding where he's

337
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Spend

338
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Where he's going to scream

339
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
He starts to get worried

340
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
Because there is this

341
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
Key scene where the boy next door

342
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,303
Psycho boyfriend

343
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,375
What's the brake line on J Lo's family car

344
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
And her son gets in and starts

345
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
Driving down a mountain Road

346
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,775
This is a terrifying moment

347
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:09,151
Wright & Cohen knows exactly how he wants to film The see this guy created The Fast and Furious

348
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
Yuan traumatic music

349
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
He wants a car tires

350
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
Reaching around corners

351
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Sweat

352
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,111
White Knuckles on the kids hands at the wheel

353
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,695
And then finally in a climactic moment the car rushing toward

354
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
But remember this is a blumhouse

355
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
And that is not the blumhouse

356
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:33,727
How sweaty that was something that in the original script was talked about as it happened off-screen

357
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
Yeah what happened what happened to your car

358
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
Oh yeah well

359
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,687
I don't know the brakes went out and it's alright we had something but it's it's we're fine

360
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:50,623
This won't work when you can't you can't you know the boy next door has cut their

361
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
Brake lines

362
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:58,303
So that they're going to get killed you can't do that off-screen then talk about it you have to show it

363
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,703
But then it was like how can you afford it I mean how can I mean you can't be afforded and then I went

364
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
Home I think I can

365
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,615
SoCo and call some old friends from The Fast and Furious days and they give him a discount

366
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
But on one card

367
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
Chasing you knows a guy

368
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,527
You know the guy even a discount car chase cost hundreds of thousands of dollars

369
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,087
So Cohen is burning through his budget

370
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:25,183
And when it gets to the climactic scene the scene where Jennifer Lopez.

371
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:28,255
Fighting back where she takes out Ryan Guzman.

372
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Evil Boy Next Door

373
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Boyfriend

374
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
At this critical moment

375
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
And Rob Cohen

376
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
Is running out of cash

377
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
He wants to burn down a

378
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
Barn

379
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
He has to skimp on the fake fire

380
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,127
Not that you know spoil the surprise here

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,527
In the script JLo is supposed to stab a hypodermic needle directly into Ryan Guzman

382
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,135
I told him he wanted to build a prosthetic head and do the scene right

383
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,695
But he's basically completely out of cash

384
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
And it turns out a fake head

385
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
1 fake

386
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
Head cost

387
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
24000

388
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Dollars

389
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,935
So is that a stabbing the needle into an eye

390
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
She has to kind of fake the scene

391
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
$24,000 is more than it cost to make

392
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Paranormal a

393
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
It's more than the cost of a used cam

394
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,967
There is a way to give the audience the gut shot

395
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,575
And there's a way to make it like LMAO that's that's

396
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,439
That's that's not nice Wiki

397
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:35,839
But then there's a way to make people and you want people to go

398
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:42,239
Like that it's those moments you want the whole audience going nuts when they start

399
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031
Edina film Cohen realizes

400
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
They are in

401
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,639
I'm seeing the deficiencies of the film

402
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
And I'm not kidding I'm not a guy after making this was my 34th movie I'm not into kid

403
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,599
Kidding myself about what's right and wrong

404
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
And I felt

405
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,719
That in several areas of the movie we pulled the punch

406
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,535
So Cohen and Jason Blum screen the film for some

407
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Studio execs

408
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Universe

409
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Nfocus

410
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
The reaction comes back

411
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
And then calling Corners JC

412
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,031
In the theater that night and says look

413
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
I can fix that

414
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
Just give me a little bit more money

415
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
Give me one fake hair

416
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,991
Another take the love scene so it's sexier than lifetime television

417
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:29,855
And a little bit more cash for more fake fire in the barn and we've got it

418
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
We will have a hip

419
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
I just need

420
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
A little bit of cash

421
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
And blum's response

422
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
No way

423
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,887
And his was you know what we just don't have the money we spent the money

424
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,287
You spent it you were partner you spend every penny you had the decision on every penny and we just

425
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:54,687
Don't have anymore and I'm going to have this whole big cup

426
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:01,087
Franchises what do you mean you don't have anymore but he was adamant and that's the that's the fee

427
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
Fiendish deal

428
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,927
Blum actually has a fourth rule

429
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
For cheap movie making

430
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
And it's Ironclad

431
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
Never

432
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Ever break your

433
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
Never try to spend your way

434
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Problem

435
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
Economist actually right about

436
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
Cydaea it's called the sunk-cost

437
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,335
Often companies and people who have spent a lot of money

438
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
A lot of time on something

439
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
They're more likely to

440
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
Continue plowing resources

441
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Into that project

442
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
Even when it's a complete disaster

443
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
The sunk cost fallacy

444
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
It drives

445
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
The big budget

446
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
What the blonde way says

447
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Spend your budget

448
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
App anymore

449
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
Did the film fails

450
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Myself

451
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
I'll be another one

452
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,935
Ahmed 10 movies in the pipeline for this year already

453
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
He expect

454
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
Did for them to fail

455
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,567
So he just thought fine the boy next door will be one of the movies that fail

456
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,871
Robert Cowan

457
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Couldn't

458
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,967
When Bloom says no no more money

459
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Cohen Jewish

460
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
He reversed with old Ally

461
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
He goes to the studio

462
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Universal

463
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
Who was thinking about Distributing the

464
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
If you guys can give me

465
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
B300

466
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,023
Just $300,000

467
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
I can get a couple extra days

468
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Days of shooting

469
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
And I can make

470
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Disgrace

471
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
Remember the sunk cost fallacy

472
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Universal buys

473
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Takes the bait

474
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
Gibbs Cohen the money

475
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,311
Cohen Rashad that love scene

476
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
Made it a little racier

477
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,175
Added more fake fire to that moment

478
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
In the burning Barn

479
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
And

480
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
He got his

481
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
Is $24,000

482
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
Static

483
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
So you actually see

484
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:44,511
Ryan's head and the needle gomboc right into the eye and believe me

485
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:51,167
Believe me the audience reaction at that moment was unbelievable

486
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,319
So the audience reaction may have been over the top

487
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
But the critics reaction

488
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
Was

489
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Pretty awful

490
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
They hated this

491
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
Actually have some of the river

492
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,863
Do you want to read one sure this one is from variety and it says

493
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,703
January releases don't get much more January

494
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Send it

495
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,055
And it's kind of an inside big January's when film studios dump

496
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
All the bad

497
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
Here's one from the Washington Post

498
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
Though it Studio blumhouse Productions

499
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,295
Is best known for the Paranormal Activity series and other Fright Fest

500
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
The boy next door plays best

501
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Is

502
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
Ken Chenault

503
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
Comedy

504
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,231
The final one from plugged in is

505
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,047
If only the boy would have stayed next door

506
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,583
Then we would have been spared this

507
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,143
Khaki salacious sexual violence

508
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
It's rough

509
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,007
So I asked Rob Cohen about the reviews and he

510
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,567
Basically started swearing but really

511
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
He didn't

512
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
Because in the end

513
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
This movie was another Jason Blum Finance

514
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
London have to pay

515
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,319
Pay for the reshoots keyspan exactly what he planned

516
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,855
4.2 million dollars

517
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
But this film

518
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
Gross more than 50 million dollars

519
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
At the Box off

520
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
And for Cohen

521
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
That was a

522
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
That was Redemption

523
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
Tons of people saw the movie

524
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Tons of people bought

525
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,656
Tickets he was back

526
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
It also didn't hurt

527
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,496
But he did pretty well financially

528
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,056
How much money are you going to make from this phone

529
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,616
Probably

530
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,688
Between a million and a half and $2000000

531
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
And how long did it take you to shoot it

532
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,296
24 days

533
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,648
This year including the boy next door Jason Blum is on track

534
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,184
To get 10 films real

535
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,256
They will cost somewhere in the neighborhood

536
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
50 million

537
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,864
And right now they are on track

538
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,888
To earn half

539
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
A billion

540
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,264
He's definitely consider now a genius

541
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:08,896
That invented a new way to make a lot of movies and make a lot of money in

542
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,480
Hollywood in the end it's all about money and success

543
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,088
Awards are nice too and last year one made a phone call to whiplash

544
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,136
That won three Academy Awards

545
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,696
But when I asked about it

546
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,000
He's not going to start making ardy award bait

547
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
Domes

548
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
His mission

549
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,352
Let's make lots of little bats on lots of little movies

550
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
Embraces flops

551
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
Force Hollywood

552
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,472
To confront its fear

553
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
A failure

554
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,080
The last time we talked to Jason Blum was in two

555
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
15

556
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,456
But this year it doesn't look like he's going to have to worry too much about embracing failure

557
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
We check in with Jason Blum in just a minute

558
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,184
Support for Planet Money and the following message come from ishares

559

It's building for your future today

561
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,632
Ishares by BlackRock inspired to build

562
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:09,056
Jason Blum has produced not one but two of this year's top earning film so far there's get out the movie that everyone

563
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Was talking about

564
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,384
And then there's another Thriller called split

565
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,200
We wanted to hear how things are going after all of

566
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,248
The success and so we gave Jason Blum

567
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
Planet money from the goddamn telephone

568
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,232
Mom says he made get out using the same formula he applies for all of the film team

569
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,560
We don't look for low-budget movies and then

570
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
See if we like them

571
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:36,704
We look for movies that we like and see if they can then be done on a lower budget

572
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,544
Anna and get out was was kind of certainly fit into that

573
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
Of course some compromises had to be made

574
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,480
For one they had to scale things down the original script called for a rich family in a big house but like

575
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Rockefeller

576
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,552
Set the tone that down to

577
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,600
Say Alabama Countryside Rec

578
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,624
Smaller house

579
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
Smart budget

580
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
For a big party scene that you

581
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:02,048
Macy in the movie The cut down the number of background actors and you'll notice that

582
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
Not very many of them have to be

583
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,888
And then another tactic

584
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,728
Json just really good at getting Maximum Impact on screen

585
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,008
4 minimum investment

586
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,336
I don't think this is a spoiler but there's a there's a moment when I

587
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,920
A deer is hit by a car and I will confess I saw that and I

588
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
I thought

589
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,016
That seems expensive for a Jason Blum movie

590
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Oh no

591
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,600
Oh no I said beer is not expensive

592
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
It's not a Dear Abby

593
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,000
And I can I can do it car hitting a deer at a very very low price

594
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,048
Give me a give me a ballpark figure for dead deer

595
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,376
A debt to shoot a dead car hitting a deer

596
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,424
10 grand 15r and no kidding

597
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Yeah

598
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,264
Jason Blum is like the movie production equivalent

599
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,872
Of your friend who somehow manages to go to a garage sale and find the one thing that is worth a ton of

600
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,920
He said he wants to make

601
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
The great movies

602
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
Everyone else

603
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
Is overlooking

604
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,016
And that seems to be working

605
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
Quite well

606
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Get out

607
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,368
Cost 4.5 million dollars to make

608
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
According to Box Office Mojo

609
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,744

610
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,376
