1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:05,632
Hey it's Robert Smith here like everyone else we have been watching this growing disaster

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:06,912
In Puerto Rico this week

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,936
Wait after the hurricane

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,240
And we noticed a particular issue

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,520
Coming up in the news

6
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,824
That we have covered before here at Planet Money

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
Tenchu is

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
The jump

9
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:19,712
The Jones Act is this old shipping law that says

10
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
Only American ships

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Can carry cargo

12
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,808
Between American ports

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
Without having to pay Hefty penalties

14
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,952
And it makes it very difficult and expensive even in the best of time

15
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,744
To get anything to Puerto Rico

16
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,560
And in the wake of This Disaster Puerto Ricans and

17
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840
Many members of Congress

18
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
Wanted this law

19
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Suspended

20
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,960
Just like the law was suspended for Texas

21
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,752
Sanford Florida after their hurricane

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
Puerto Rico needs

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,080
Hey they need relief

24
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,872
From the rest of America

25
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,944
And I frankly don't care at this point whether it's an American ship

26
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,272
Orr Ford midship bringing aid from the rest of America

27
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
But

28
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,624
So far as of this recording on Wednesday

29
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,952
The Trump Administration has not suspended the Jones Act

30
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,976
Puerto Rico

31
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,536
The Department of Homeland Security says they're looking into it

32
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
But they're not sure if it would help it

33
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,424
Today we are going to replay our show about the history of the Jones Act

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
It is a fascinating episode

35
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,288
Podcast originally aired back in 2014

36
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,104
But as you will see it is totally relevant this way

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
I meant this.

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
In Midtown Manhattan

39
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
Over on the west side

40
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
Hudson River

41
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
We don't really think of the city as a

42
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,136
Or any more but it is for cruise ships

43
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
I'm looking up at

44
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,256
Two enormous boats there is biggest apartment building

45
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,096
It's windy and cold in these boats are going to The Bahamas

46
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,704
It was busy before out here but now it's quiet everyone is on board

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
The ship is getting ready to

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
All of a sudden

49
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,336
This family comes

50
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,736
Tearing around the corner Rowley suitcases are bouncing their backpacks all their stuff they're rushing to the Bone

51
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,064
Employee is yelling at them come on

52
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
And

53
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
He just misses

54
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
Begin playing

55
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
Is poor mom

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
Her teenage son slumped down into chairs

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,336
Soaking they all sit in this

58
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,384
Little terminal we can see the ship

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
Through the window getting ready to leave

60
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
Mom gets on the phone so it Norwegian

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,344
Cruise Lines it turned out there may be a way to catch the ship

62
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
Ward hit the Bahamas

63
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Because it stops in Orlando for like

64
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:41,536
A day and maybe the family can get on a plane to Florida and

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Save the bay

66
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
We're trying to

67
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
Contact Norwegian

68
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
Sea-Doo allow us to board in Orlando

69
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,496
On the phone she's taking notes

70
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
The news is good

71
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
Florida weekend

72
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
However

73
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:01,504
As long as you're boarding in the United States you will have to pay up to $300 per person extra the board

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
Did they tell you why

75
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
It's a booking what did she say was

76
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,392
And she said she falls under the Jones Act

77
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,720
So I don't know in your research look up the Java

78
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
She's written the words

79
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
Jones Act

80
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
On her Notepad

81
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
Underlined it and put a big box

82
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
Surrounded

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,544
We here at the light of mine did not have to look it up we've actually been wanting to do a story about the Jones act for a while it is one of those really old

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Old laws

85
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
Pops up in all these strange

86
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
The Jones Act was written over 90 years ago

87
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,272
But today it's still governs just about anything that travels by ship

88
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
Bananas hair dryers gasoline

89
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:42,720
The core of the Jones act dictates that every time you want to send something from one us

90
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Port to another Us Port

91
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,816
The cargo must travel on a ship

92
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Built

93
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
In America

94
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
Staffed by Americans

95
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
Owned by America

96
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
The cruise ship

97
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
Play call Chris

98
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
Was foreign-owned

99
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
This is a pretty unusual

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,664
If you want to send a bunch of oranges by truck from

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
From Florida to Baltimore

102
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
Doesn't matter who made the truck

103
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
The truck can be made in

104
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Germany

105
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
You want to fly some

106
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
Computer chips across the country it's fine if the planes in Airbus made

107
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
But you want to send cargo by ship

108
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Bishop

109
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768

Hello and welcome to Planet Money on David kestenbaum

111
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:27,263
Damn sure we dig into the words that the woman's scribbled on her Notepad

112
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
The Jones Act

113
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
We look at all it's strange

114
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
Consequences that play out

115
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
All these crazy ways in this country

The Jones act it actually popped up in my life

130
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
Recently I live in New Jersey

131
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,047
And a couple weeks ago in the middle of like 5 snowstorm

132
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,375
We found out that the state had run out of salt

133
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,191
It run out of rock salt to melt the snow and

134
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,007
Which is a really dangerous thing to run out

135
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,359
There was a fairly simple solution New Jersey did not salt but

136
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
The state of Maine had a Giant Mountain of

137
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,247
And as it turned out right in a port in Maine

138
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
There was this really big ship

139
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,623
That seems like it could carry all the salt to New Jersey

140
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
I mean it was just like Serendipity here's this

141
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,743
Ship that's big enough to take 40000 tons of salt

142
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
It's on its way to Newark anyway this is perfect

143
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,631
That's Jody one of the guys in charge of getting salt furniture

144
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,447
He had one problem though you can almost

145
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
Extreme writing it on his Notepad

146
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
And drawing a big box around it

147
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
The Joneses

148
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
That ship was not made in America not flying in America

149
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,639
Can flag

150
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
The captain is it turns out

151
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Atlas Greek

152
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,295
Jones act says you cannot use that kind of ship to carry anything from one Us Port to another

153
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,111
The workaround was quite painful

154
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,951
The US doesn't deal that many ships anymore especially

155
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Pair to other country

156
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
And the only Jones Act

157
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:29,375
It's compliant ship was this little barge so you really wanted to see this little barge

158
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
One morning you

159
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,263
Amen

160
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
I'm here I'm looking at it dude

161
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,359
Enzo you recorded your best

162
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Weather reporter on the sea

163
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,759
I'm standing here at Birth 13 looking at this bar

164
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
It's filled with rock salt

165
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
Salt to melt the snow

166
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,439
They just came down here from Searsport Maine to New Jersey

167
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,279
We have to ask reporter Jay field in Maine to do his part at the mountain of Saw

168
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
MJ Field in

169
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
Searsport Maine

170
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
Where the rock salt

171
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Just came from

172
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
What's funny is that

173
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
There is still a huge

174
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Pile

175
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Assault in front of me

176
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,847
The barge was not nearly big enough to carry that mountain of salt

177
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
At least not in one trip

178
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
Pet store

179
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:20,575
Okay so this is the plan they're going to drop off the rock salt here and then this barge is going to turn

180
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
Turn around and

181
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Head back up to you

182
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Annies

183
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
Going to pick up another fraction

184
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Of this

185
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,767
Large pile and head back down to you

186
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,863
And it's going to drop off the rocks out here in New Jersey and

187
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Turn around and head back to you

188
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,215
And pick a contact has been around for over 90 years

189
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
And at this point coming up with workarounds

190
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
Has become a sort of art form in the maritime

191
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
Hawaii is really the

192
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,431
New Jersey you can drive their senses

193
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
Hawaii

194
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
There is no train that goes to Hawaii

195
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,599
If you want to bring stuff from Hawaii back to the rest of the United States

196
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
It's probably going to have to go

197
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Go by boat

198
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,439
I talk to this one cattle ranch

199
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
In Hawaii is named is Pono Von Holt

200
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
He raises cows

201
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
In Hawaii

202
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
But the market for burgers is

203
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
Across the ocean on the mainland

204
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
The Jones act says

205
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
He needs to use a Merrick

206
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,055
And the thing about just made in America Creed by Americans is that

207
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
They are expensive

208
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
Are expensive to manufacture an expensive

209
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,711
Tony told me for a while he was using foreign ships

210
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
And what you would do if you would send the cows to

211
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Canada

212
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,855
And then they travel by land over the Border back to the United

213
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
States

214
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
That didn't work out

215
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,487
These days he's doing something that sounds crazier witches

216
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,815
She said some of the cows to the mainland by airplane

217
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
Deceive money

218
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,911
Send the cows when they're little and don't waste them

219
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
People like cows are also subject to these old laws that was the problem

220
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
I'm at the family ran into

221
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
The cruise ship

222
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,103
It is illegal for a foreign-owned cruise ship

223
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,919
To pick you up in one Us Port and drop you in another

224
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,503
Which is why the family had to pay a fine for getting on Orlando

225
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
The cruise ship at the end of the trip was going to drop every

226
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
Economy

227
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
Maybe yes they are not fans of

228
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
The Jones Act

229
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
When cows

230
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,767
Why is the sign that there's some real distortion

231
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
In the maritimes

232
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,375
We called up Joseph stiglitz used to chair the Council of

233
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Economic advisers under

234
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
President Clinton

235
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,239
He said the council took a look at the Jones act and said

236
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,567
Okay look it does save some jobs in the shipping industry

237
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
But it also makes all kinds of other thing

238
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
Things cost way more than they

239
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
How much are we paying

240
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
To save those

241
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
They did the math

242
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
So we did this calculation

243
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
And ask

244
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
The question how much did

245
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
A shop cost

246
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
What was the answer

247
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,927
It was something like a quarter million dollars

248
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
Job

249
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,023
What do you make of that number

250
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,863
Will that it was a very inefficient way of job creation

251
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Stupid

252
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,007
Is there any economic argument in favor of the Jones

253
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,383
Other than an argument of certain special interest now

254
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
Send out

255
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
Do you know any Economist who like the Joneses

256
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
No I don't

257
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
I've never met one

258
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
According to an official report around this time

259
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:07,743
By the United States International Trade Commission the Jones Act was costing the country over 1 billion dollars

260
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Why does this thing

261
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
Good question

262
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Love you answer after the break

270
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
Why does this thing exist

271
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,543
The basic idea of requiring that

272
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
Cargo travel on domestic ship

273
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
It's goes back

274
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,431
But this current Incarnation the Jones Act

275
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
Is from 1920

276
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
1920

277
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
World War 1 hitches

278
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,903
Extended during the War the government geared up to build ship after ship after ship

279
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,999
But then the war ended and the ships were still being built

280
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
Cheers up Maritime historian

281
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Jeff bolster

282
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
There's this glut

283
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
Of ships I mean

284
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,471
It does still being turned out now in the shipyards owned by the emergency

285
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Ashley Corporation

286
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Okay

287
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
As a result of that

288
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
Anybody could see that

289
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
In the short run ship

290
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,943
The building was going to become depressed

291
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,295
Because the government had stepped in to build all of this tonnage to win the war

292
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,623
Also means that the market will be saturated with tonnage for a while

293
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
So that shipbuilding yards would simply

294
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Not everything to do

295
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
And you know where there are a lot of shipyards

296
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Seattle wash

297
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Michigan State

298
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,375
And Washington State happen to have a very

299
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Powerful sin

300
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Head of the

301
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
Senator Wesley

302
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Elgin

303
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Senator Jones

304
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,079
Concerned about his hometown shipbuilding industry

305
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Which is Congress to pass

306
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
The Merchant Marine Act of 1920

307
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
The Jones Act

308
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,551
And it received some news coverage at the time here's a snippet from a new story

309
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
Written by 1gj Underwood

310
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
You do it

311
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
Indirectly it affects the

312
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
Warren transportation of

313
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,423
Every product of American industry upon it is also dependent the industrial expansion of the

314
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Ignition

315
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,775
Literally thousands of different interest will be affected by it

316
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
That ran in the Seattle Times

317
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,895
Home-state which over the years clearly benefited from the hard worker

318
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
In fact

319
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,271
The barge with the salt in New Jersey that was made in Seattle

320
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Jones Act

321
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
The other argument for the Jones Act made at the

322
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
What time was military readiness

323
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Basically

324
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
If we get another War

325
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
We're going to need American ships

326
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
An American to know how to say

327
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
This is the argument that the shipbuilding industry

328
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Makes today

329
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,935
There are certain things in this country that are

330
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
Record to protecting the country

331
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
Shipbuilding industrial base

332
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Just happens to be one of the

333
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
Derrell Connor is a lobbyist with the American Maritime partnership he represents us shipbuilders you a shipbuilding come

334
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Japanese

335
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,063
In Wartime he says you need people who know how to make ships

336
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
Warships that were used

337
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
To fight battles

338
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
And you also need ordinary cargo ships first

339
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Supplies

340
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Food and medical stuff

341
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
Almost 90%

342
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,607
Of the Cargoes carried in the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars

343
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
Or carried on US flag ships

344
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
Are those weren't Jones accept

345
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
A lot of the seafarers

346
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
Served on those vessels

347
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
Served in the Jones act trade so the Jones Act

348
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,127
Play Vital role in

349
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
Ensuring we have those Seafarer

350
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,783
So what you saying here is okay it is true even with the Jones act we don't have enough ships

351
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Pet Supply are true

352
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
What time

353
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
We have to use alipay

354
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
Quadriceps but the Jones act gives us some

355
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
And it gives us strength

356
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
The Economist Joseph stiglitz says

357
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,839
He heard those arguments when he was in the Clinton administration

358
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:00,191
No one on the Council of economic advisers found them very convincing

359
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,519
We are dependent on foreign countries for a lot of stuff

360
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
Well food

361
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
Steal clothes

362
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,895
We need use the ports of our allies in Europe

363
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,223
Why do we have to insist on American-made ships

364
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
America

365
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
Crew flying under Americans

366
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
I think the view the console's economic advisor

367
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
We should get rid of it

368
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
We're not

369
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,231
Yo where they wear a visor

370
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
So we can just say what are the economic cost

371
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,143
And is there a plausible argument that there are any benefits

372
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
Metro with a cost

373
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
And we could not see any

374
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
And then what happened next

375
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
But I can

376
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
Nothing

377
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:45,247
It's a political non-starter it's been that way for 90 years when US military teams up

378
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
Up with unions and shipbuilders

379
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
That is a lot of lobbying power

380
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
Put that up against tomorrow

381
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,999
Who missed the cruise ship a guy who needs a bunch of salt a Hawaiian cattle rancher

382
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
They don't stand a chance

383
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,607
Academics have a fancy term for this the Jones act has

384
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
Concentrated benefits

385
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
And a few scars

386
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
A small group of people benefit a lot

387
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
The cost gets passed

388
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
The rest of us in little

389
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,967
The only way the Jones Act is going to change is it the cars become more obvious and more powerful

390
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
People start yelling about getting rid of it

391
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
That could happen

392
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
Because of the way that our economy is changing

393
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
At this moment

394
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,951
Bus as you probably know was in the middle of an oil boom

395
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
Thanks to fracking

396
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,303
Do you want to send oil from Houston to Philadelphia by sea

397
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
You have to use a Jones act ship

398
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,143
And there are not that many of those

399
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:39,007
So the price is going up and US oil producers are starting to get really mad

400
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
What about this restriction

401
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
But for the moment

402
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,359
Got to play by the rules laid out in the Joneses

403
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,175
If you're sending something from one Us Port to another

404
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
Got to be on the ship built in America

405
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
American Crew

406
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
Buying in America

407
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
Just reminder this show was from

408
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,767
2014 but this debate about the Jones Act is going on

409
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Even to this day

410
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:07,167

Today show with originally produced by Jess Jiang

413
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
Rerun was produced by Elizabeth kulak

414
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
And our intern Alice weld

415
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919

418

On the NPR politics

422
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,815
But it seems NPR political reporters and editors we record two episodes a week

423
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
And sometimes more when the big news happened

424
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,215
