I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,128
I'm hosting a new podcast from the Planet Money Team called

5
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:16,896
The indicator

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,688

7
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,480

On NPR one or wherever you get your pie

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,184
Last month I did what many millions of Americans did

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,232
I bought a plane ticket home for the holidays

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,864
Okay depart 23rd return 29th

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
Finalizing prices

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,264
The suspense is killing me too

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,824
To be honest buffering buffering

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,104
Buffering

16
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:53,760
So home for me is Boise Idaho it is always kind of an expensive flight because it's a small airport there are not that many flights

17
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
In and out

18
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320
What this year was

19
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Exception

20
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,648
Okay so

21
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,720
Cheapest flight home during those dates is

22
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
1000

23
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
Street

24
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,912
Not to be clear this was not a last-minute ticket I was looking for these tickets in mid November

25
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,496
And you also have only 5 tickets left so you actually have to buy it

26
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
I need it right now

27
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,616
You think I don't buy them now though go up or is this they can't go higher

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,408
They went higher

29
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,272
I waited a few days. Why is leap and bought the tickets for

30
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,064
Today's Planet Money indicator

31
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,904
$1,277

32
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
And $0.10

33
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,768
That is how much I paid for a plane ticket home

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
Stacy as we say in the news business

35
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
You're not alone

36
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,680
Your story is part of this big

37
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
Interesting shift in the US Airline Indus

38
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
Because over the last five years tickets to smaller cities

39
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,128
Like Boise Idaho have been getting more expensive

40
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
Wild the same time tickets

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,224
Between big cities like New York in LA or

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
Between New York and Miami

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Maven getting cheaper

44
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
It's on today's show we asked

45
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
Why is this happening

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,488

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Understand why I had to pay so much to go home to Boise for the holidays I called Henry Hart about he's an airline analyst

60
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
With the atmosphere research

61
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,296
You must love your family a great deal and I hope they appreciate you

62
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,392
An awful lot as well as 10 years ago there were a lot of

63
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
A big National Airlines in the U

64
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
Price competition was released

65
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,792
Pierce send those Airlines started buying each other

66
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,632
We've had a series of mergers and now we have four

67
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
Super large Airline

68
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
United States

69
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,216
American

70
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
Delta Southwest and United

71
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,872
Which collectively control more than 80% of the airline capacity

72
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
In the United States

73
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,480
All of that merging in the airline industry it means a lot less

74
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,064
Competition at the same time the airlines were swimming way down

75
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
You are flights smaller

76
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
When you have

77
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
Your flights

78
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
You're lying

79
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
NPR seats

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
You end up

81
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,352
With higher average airfares into some of these less

82
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
Competitive cities

83
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
Less competitive cities

84
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Tok Boise

85
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Sorry Stacy

86
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
I thank you

87
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
So I booked my flight out of Newark

88
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,104
And Henry told me the average price for tickets from Newark

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Boise

90
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
Everything about 10% over the last five

91
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
This is typical for smaller City

92
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
But Henry said

93
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:10,368
That's for people flying from one big city to another big city it is a completely different story

94
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
Because welfares to smaller City

95
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,720
I've been rising fares between big cities

96
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
Have actually been falling

97
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
And it's pretty clear reason

98
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
Those new altar

99
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Discount Airlines

100
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Airlines like Allegiant

101
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Frontier

102
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Spirit

103
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Their prices are super cheap in the pudding

104
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
How to price pressure on the old

105
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
School Airline

106
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
Not for me and all of my fellow travelers to

107
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
Less competitive cities

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,271
There is a light at the end of the tunnel the ultra discount airlines are growing really fast and flying to more and more cities

109
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,087
And in fact Allegiant has just started flying into

110
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,159
Frontier is going to start flying into Boise next year

111
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
So Henry says it is very likely that my

112
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,767
2018 ticket home for Christmas

113
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,143
Will cost way less than 1200 and $77.10

114
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959

117
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,415
I was curious if you spent just a little bit more money where you go

118
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Citgo

119
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,791
Oh no I was just in case you're tempted

120
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
Honolulu

121
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,119
You know which I hear is

122
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
Nicer this time of year Boise

123
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
Don't get me wrong I'm sure boys easel

124
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
Lovely lovely town

125
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,567
If you get there for thirteen hundred bucks

126
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
And Buenos Aires where in fact

127
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
The seasons are inverted so it's actually

128
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
Summer you get there for 1400 bucks

129
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:50,719
I'm sorry if I'm making you feel badly about the founded by

130
