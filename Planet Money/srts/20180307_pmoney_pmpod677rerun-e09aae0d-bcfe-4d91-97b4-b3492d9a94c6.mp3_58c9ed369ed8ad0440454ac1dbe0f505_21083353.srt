1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04,608
Just a quick note Today Show is a rerun it originally aired back in 2006

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,936
Also there is a new update at the end of the show

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,472
It's a good update

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,752
Okay so

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,056
Can you read me the title of the paper

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,616
Feeling the future

7
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,408
Experimental evidence

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,968
For anomalous retroactive influences

9
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,504
On cognition and Fa

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,576
Feeling a future meaning like people can see into

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,624
Basically ESP

12
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416
ESP

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,952
We're talking to Brian nosek

14
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,232
He's a psychologist

15
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,256
City University of Georgia

16
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,048
Missy public where

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,120
In the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology

18
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,912
I'd like a top turn on the

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,192
That's right

20
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,216
Peer-reviewed

21
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,264
Peer-reviewed extensively

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,056
This paper came out in two thousand eleven

23
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,616
Brian nosek like a lot of psycho

24
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
Just thought

25
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,920
What is going on

26
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,456
Like there's no way that

27
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
But then again

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
Here is this paper

29
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,576
Describing not just one experiment

30
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,600
But nine

31
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,368
Different XP

32
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,744
Rhino success some of them are really pretty convincing even today when you flip through the paper

33
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:09,888
The main site hypothesis was that participants will be able to identify the position of the hidden pictures significantly more often than

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
In one experiment he says people were told to stare at this

35
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Computer screen

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
And are told that an image

37
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
Was going to appear on either the right side or the left side

38
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,872
And they were asked to guess

39
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
Which side

40
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
Like looking to the Future

41
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,224
Which side do you think the image is going to

42
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,832
And people do okay on this they do better in this study than if

43
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
They just been random chat

44
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,672
This paper was published by a scientist that

45
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
Cornell univ

46
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,488
A researcher who is really well worth

47
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,304
And when Brian nosek read the paper

48
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,120
There did not seem to be any obvious problem with

49
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
The paper is beautiful

50
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,704
It follows all the rules

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
Of what one does

52
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,032
Doesn't look really beautiful way

53
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
This ESP paper through the field into really a crisis

54
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
Because nothing says

55
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,456
They're basically two possible explanations

56
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Either

57
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
We have to

58
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:03,136
Conclude that USPS true because there's these 9 studies that show it

59
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
Or we have to change our beliefs

60
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
About the right ways to do science

61
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
Nothing is going with option

62
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,048
And not just for psychology

63
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,352
For biology economics

64
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
32nd St Pub

65
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
The policy medical decisions

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
She thinks there's something wrong with the way we're do

67
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
Doing science

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Today on the show

69
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,504
Is something rotten at the heart of science is ESP real

70
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,040
I hope he is miserable

71
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
I need

72
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Magazine

73
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Discus

74
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
Support for this podcast

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,768
In the following message

76
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,072
It's come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

More information is available at aecf. Org

80
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,408
ESP research paper raise this very deep questions

81
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
For science

82
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
In general

83
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,064
If It's Paper is wrong but the researcher followed all the rules and experimental protocols

84
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
What else out there

85
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
What about all those

86
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
Thousands and thousands of other studies

87
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
You know just walk through and research

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Library University

89
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
UC shelves and shelves of bound volumes of

90
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
Going back decades

91
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,216
Full of big important experiments like hey we cloned a sheep

92
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
All that stuff you read the newspaper

93
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Oat bran

94
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
Reducing the risk of heart attack

95
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,640
ARP if you want to get somebody's attention whisper in their right ear

96
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
That probably works better than the left

97
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
How much of the stuff in those books

98
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Is just wrong

99
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,320
No sex after that ESP paper comes out

100
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
No one's really sure people are saying

101
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,488
Oh there is a huge problem or no there's no problem at all what are you talking about

102
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
And it's all speculation

103
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
And we just don't have any data

104
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,144
Brian I've been thinking about this stuff for a long

105
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
ESP study came out

106
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,752
Everybody else in the field with suddenly thinking about

107
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
Inotia figured maybe this is my moment to do so

108
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
To get to the bottom of the

109
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
He decides to do this thing that

110
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,248
It's supposed to be part of the whole normal scientific

111
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
But rarely actually gets

112
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
He decides he's going to try to repeat

113
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
A bunch of

114
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,232
Experiments redo them original papers look at how the researchers did the experiment

115
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
And try to replicate

116
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
See if it actually holds up

117
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
Joseph Lampkin repeat A1c

118
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,935
Set repeating study after study after study

119
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,335
We're not going to put aside all of our active research in order to try to replicate a bunch of studies in r

120
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,943
Literally just don't have the time to do it with the resources I couldn't that just be your work

121
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,039
Because grad students in my lab would never get jobs

122
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
Sonos it wasn't sure who else was going to join him

123
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
I mean repeating work that is already been done

124
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
Is not how you get

125
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
Tenure

126
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
You know you putting all this work

127
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
And if you confirm the original results

128
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
Aaron's going to be like yeah we knew that

129
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
Good friend figured what the heck

130
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
To try to find enough research

131
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,263
Interested to do that thing to repeat a lots and lots of it

132
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:05,919
So we sent out an email to people in the field saying are you interested you want to join this effort

133
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
Oh and doesn't the people

134
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527
Instantly a joint there a lot of people

135
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,623
All that were interested in this issue and so it was like oh wow that's can really be a project

136
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
In fact there's so much interest that no 6 decides

137
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,511
We're going to redo 100 experiments

138
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,815
Nice big round impressive number

139
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,375
Any decides where to take them from the top journals

140
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Free the top psychology

141
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,031
And so in 2012 hundreds of researchers in Labs all over the place

142
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Get to work

143
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,103
Start redoing all these experiments

144
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Michigan State

145
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,223
David Johnson and his colleagues were trying to repeat this experiment that had shown

146
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
People wash their hands

147
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
They make less severe moral judge

148
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
We had to have our participants

149
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,415
Wash their hands and it had to be

150
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,767
Done in a way that didn't Dart draw tension to the fact that they were washing their hands

151
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
In Virginia researchers were testing what you can think of is

152
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,863
The afternoon treat

153
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
Ej masicampo at wake forest university

154
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
He did the original

155
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
Search Lee showed that

156
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
A

157
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Sugar boost

158
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
So drinking a sugary lemonade

159
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
Mixed people

160
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,711
Engage more effortful decision-making

161
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,039
If you're tired drinking something with a bunch of sugar in it helps you think harder

162
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
Makes sense but is it true

163
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,439
The researchers doing the replications tried to repeat the experiment exactly

164
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
They filed the original protocols

165
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
As closely as they

166
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,839
If the original sugary beverage experiment gave the stew

167
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
Lemonade

168
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
When they repeated it

169
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
One by one the researchers finish their work

170
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Work submitted the result

171
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,055
But Brian nosek didn't look at any of those results while the project was

172
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,639
So when did you first see the results

173
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
It was the

174
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,271
Day we hit 100 studies completed

175
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
We shut down the party

176
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
We're done

177
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
We had a hundred

178
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
Someone else have been keeping a spreadsheet

179
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
Tracking all the replica

180
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
I know sex finally looks at the spreadsheet

181
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,863
That he just goes down the list you know there are these are these hundred studies

182
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
And for each one he answers this basic question

183
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
Did it confirm the original

184
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,799
Yes or no just goes down the list yes

185
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
Yes no

186
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,407
And then just at get to the end and count up

187
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
39 yeses

188
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
M61 News

189
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:21,343
So you found that of these hundreds that is in most of them they did not

190
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,623
Confirm the original

191
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
Write Jacob this is amazing

192
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
Like you know I was a physics major I want

193
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
Went to grad school like

194
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
I spent a bunch a Time

195
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
In the research

196
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,167
Walking past all these bound volumes of Journal article

197
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,727
For sure if you would ask me back then

198
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,591
Like if I thought the findings in them were more likely to be true than Falls I would say yes definitely

199
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,919
Anytime like 60% could not be replica

200
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
Like that lemonade experiment

201
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
The hand washing

202
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,295
Experiment neither of those could be replicated

203
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
Yet to be honest this number this 39 yeses and 60 Windows Vista number right here is why I wanted to do

204
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
May I found it

205
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
I found it completely shocked

206
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
Nintendo

207
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Didn't know what to make

208
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
Yeah

209
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Well I

210
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,263
I don't I don't know what I thought is more of

211
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
Oh how the heck did that happen

212
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,103
How do bunch of scientific study

213
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Seem to follow

214
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
All the rules of the scientific

215
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
And make it into peer review journal

216
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
How is it pause

217
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
Oh that's so many of them seem to be wrong

218
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,623
First thing to say this is not about

219
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Fraud I mean sure

220
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,791
They're examples out there of researchers just straight-up faking their results but that's not what's going on here

221
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,607
She thinks what is going on here is something really

222
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
More interesting

223
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,679
Wednesday ideas for WhatsApp

224
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,495
Is that a lot of what you are seeing in the journey

225
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Are flukes

226
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Statistical

227
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,663
Here let me give you an example this is from a little experiment I did this morning

228
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Flipping a coin

229
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Heads

230
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
Had the gun

231
00:08:59,391 --> 00:08:59,903
Tell

232
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Blue Hats

233
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
Has again

234
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
I flipped it 10 times Jacob

235
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,911
9 * I got heads only one tails

236
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:16,031
If you do this to tistical analysis you do for like a drug trial or any scientist

237
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,359
This looks like a remarkable results

238
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
Is only like a 1% chance

239
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
That this is a fluke

240
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
So I send this off to the journalist

241
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
You could get this published when you going to call it

242
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Heads up

243
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,255
Bias in American quarter dollars minted in 1977

244
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
You can imagine the world going crazy right like

245
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:44,959
Workout before the game home strategies are emerging based on your study what you do not

246
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
In reading this one article

247
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
Coin flipping

248
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
And this is Keith

249
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,871
Is that a bunch of other researchers

250
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Have also been doing

251
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
Feather results

252
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Arles

253
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
Heads

254
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Heads

255
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Tails

256
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Tails

257
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,303
Half heads half tails there lots of experiments like this

258
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
So why don't you read about these in the journal

259
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
Because it's such a bore him finding right like

260
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
You get this finding nobody's going to publish

261
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,823
I'm not going to send it off I'm just going to stick my results here

262
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,383
In this file cabinet with all the other failed

263
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
No success there's even the name

264
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
It's called the file drawer

265
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
Turtles are much more likely

266
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
To publish a positive result in a negative result

267
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
In fact

268
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:39,231
97% of results in Psychology that are published are positive results

269
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,023
Positive here means hey we found something

270
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
Negative is Madden

271
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,631
So is there some whole Shadow universe

272
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,191
Negative results that nobody ever heard of

273
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:54,591
Are tons of them and everyone can tell you about the effects that they have in their Labs that are published

274
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
In this

275
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
Of course this is a disaster

276
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
You know you could imagine

277
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:04,319
Lots of people doing the equivalent of testing whether coins are more likely to come up heads or tails when you

278
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,159
Almost all of them find of course there is no difference

279
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
But one David kestenbaum

280
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,047
They're more likely to come up heads and that is the one that gets published

281
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
This file drawer effect

282
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
Is the kind of thing that can help

283
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Yes

284
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:24,543
And also it can partially explain why there were all those nose on no 6 spreadsheet why

285
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
So many studies failed to read

286
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
But

287
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,687
But no 6 has the file drawer effect is not enough

288
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
It doesn't explain

289
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
All of

290
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
That many studies in people's file

291
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
No she thinks there is another big issue

292
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,207
And this one is a little touchy or because it points to this

293
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
Human sort of weakness

294
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
Our ability to trigger

295
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,119
The subconsciously kind of skew the results

296
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
Okay let's go back to the coin flipping

297
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Let's leave it at the beginning of the experiment

298
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Our plan is

299
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,591
We're going to flip the coin 10 times and see what we get

300
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
We flipped a coin 10 times and we get

301
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,967
Seven heads now seven heads is interest

302
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Thing you look at that

303
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Can you say hey

304
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
Seems like we're getting more heads than tails

305
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
But it is not enough to

306
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
So you do something that seems reasonable

307
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
You say

308
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Let's get some more.

309
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Let's add some more

310
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Flip a coin I don't know

311
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
4 more

312
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
You do that you get a few more heads

313
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
And now you like hey we found some

314
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Let Pub

315
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
Seems reasonable it is not

316
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
Reasonable

317
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
You are effectively here

318
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,359
Changing the rules in the middle of the game in the middle of experiment

319
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,711
And you know you could just keep extending the experiment until you find something that seems 6th

320
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
If you do that what happens is you

321
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,719
You increase the chances that you'll find something that seems really interesting but is actually just

322
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
Just random

323
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
And if you're like come on does that really happen

324
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
Yeah it really happened

325
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
Steve Lindsay is a psychology

326
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Professor at the University of

327
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
He says he and lots of other people

328
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
Have made this kind of mistake in the back

329
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Here's how it happens

330
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
Okay let's start now Loop

331
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:08,479
Just 20 people inside glass not quite significant but it's it's looking promising let's plus test another 12 people

332
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,855
And the notion was just moving towards truth you test more people you're moving towards truth

333
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,183
But in fact and I mean I just didn't believe

334
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
Understand this properly

335
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,559
If you do that you increase the likelihood that you will

336
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Jeffy

337
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
Hope significant effect

338
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
By chance alone

339
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,471
There are lots of ways you can trick yourself like

340
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,799
Just subtle ways you change the rules in the middle of an XP

341
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,335
Is Brian nosek

342
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,175
When I do research in laboratory I have choices I make

343
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
About how to analyze the data

344
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,551
And about what what of the data that I get to report

345
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,207
And so I might be more likely to find a way of analyzing the data that looks good for me

346
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
Right it confirms my hypothesis

347
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,583
It provides a result that's exciting that's very publishable

348
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
I might decide that must be the right way to analyze the data

349
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
And I might do that

350
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,287
While thinking and trying to be genuine and accurate

351
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
But the fact that I have a conflict of interest

352
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,711
And that's where the results have implications for me and my career advancement

353
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,527
Means that I might construct stories to myself

354
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
That lead me

355
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,159
Finding results in reporting results of literature that just are

356
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,975
Exaggeration of reality that just aren't true

357
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,047
I am start a journal called the Journal of exaggerated reality

358
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,863
Overtake the journal coin flipping it's number one

359
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,727
But that is the fear right that there a lot of journals out there that are the journals of exaggerated

360
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,567
Reality yeah I mean you don't you put together the file drawer effect and this

361
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
Problem of scientist tricking them

362
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
And it goes a long way toward

363
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Explain this a long way toward explaining

364
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,271
Why you no one knows this project so many of those studies failed

365
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
These are not just issues in psychology

366
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
People are suddenly now really worried about this

367
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
This kind of thing in lots of

368
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
And there's this big new push to do something

369
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,559
We talked to an economist who's doing something similar to what no signal

370
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,607
Trying to repeat a bunch of experiments

371
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
The time in economics

372
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
Yeah and they're also projects going in in

373
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,495
Ecology another one in in cancer biology

374
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Just to be clear like

375
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
There are certainly

376
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,103
Plenty of things that science knows for sure

377
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
More like smoking causes

378
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
Climate changes

379
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
The Higgs boson I'm telling you

380
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,807
Exist there's lots of stuff that gets published in the journals with his just no question

381
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
Like it happened on lab bench somewhere

382
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,439
They can repeat it other people have repeated it is definitely true

383
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:31,839
But there is this other category of scientific research you know a single studies that have not been replicated

384
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Rely on

385
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Correlation

386
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,727
Where the file drawer effect is a problem and researchers tracking themselves

387
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
Another trying not to

388
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
Is a problem

389
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
No success there is this one thing

390
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,919
That would go a long way toward fixing these

391
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
The file drawer effect

392
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Kicking themselves

393
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
This thing is pretty simple

394
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,087
Before you do the study you write down how you're going to do it

395
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,159
How you going to analyze your data and what you're going to try to learn

396
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,743
You write all that down and then you submit it to an online register

397
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
That makes it impossible to change the rules as you go along

398
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
And then when you finish your experiment you

399
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,191
Put your results in the registry to

400
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
Even if you do not find a

401
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,311
Those results that would normally go in the file drawer

402
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
Those get made public

403
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
So that everybody knows what

404
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
What you found

405
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
In fact happened in other fields

406
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,783
In in drug research a while back they made this mandatory

407
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,831
Huge effect

408
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,415
According to the analysis before the registry was created

409
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,511
More than half of the published studies of heart disease showed positive results

410
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
After the registry was created

411
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,351
Only 8% had positive

412
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
From more than 50 to 8

413
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,519
Did Lindsey this psychologist who talked about the problem of adding more people to an existing study

414
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
To try to get a

415
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
In effect

416
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,127
He's also the editor right now of a journal called

417
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Psychological

418
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,247
And he says when scientists come to him now with the results hoping to get Pub

419
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,295
He often points them to the registry

420
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
You're quite often

421
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:02,975
Saying okay this looks promising this looks interesting I want you to run a pre-registered replication

422
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,047
You mean you won't publish it unless they do that right

423
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
This is a hard

424
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,399
Sing I mean someone who used to do research and hang out with

425
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,007
Feels like someone saying we don't trust you got to write down exactly what you're going to do but

426
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,615
Like I'm somebody told me that when we were doing physics I would like flies fine but I don't need to do

427
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Like I know it

428
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:25,759
Yeah you can really see how this whole thing that the registry and even the replication themselves

429
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
Can be an emotional issue

430
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087
We haven't mentioned this yet but Brian nosek

431
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,439
The guy who loves replication right who headed up that whole study to repeat all those

432
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
Experiments

433
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
One of the experiments that was being

434
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Repeated

435
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
Was when he did

436
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
And when this other lab redid his experiment

437
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,727
They could not replicate his original results

438
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
And that's that's a little hard for him to deal with

439
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,567
So do you think you were wrong

440
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
No

441
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
No I wasn't

442
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
Replication is wrong

443
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,759
Well it may not be wrong entirely either

444
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:03,391
So I'm willing to grant that in fact

445
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:09,023
We gave them access to the way in which we collected the data they analyze that the same way

446
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
And the results came out differently

447
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:17,471
It's all it's this is a this is the rough right I am invested in that original result

448
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,287
No sex after those results came out

449
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Nobody

450
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,383
Not one researcher raise their hand and said

451
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
I guess that means I would

452
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
A lot of people said no.

453
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
The problem was with the replication

454
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
And no success in some cases

455
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
The problem was with the rep

456
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
But all of them

457
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
No way

458
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,351
So that is where we left things back in 2016

459
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,399
It is now 2018

460
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,519
And the results of that economics replication project that we mentioned are now public

461
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,079
We will tell you the results of that project

462
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103

471
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,399
In that economics replication project

472
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
Researchers

473
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,983
Redid 18 economics

474
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
Experiment

475
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
They have been published in Top Gun

476
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:29,151
The results of the project were published themselves in the journal science

477
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
And I spoke with one of the lead authors of the project

478
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,783
Onyx rapper of the Stockholm School of economics

479
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
And after

480
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
Out of the 18 studies

481
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
How many successfully wrap

482
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
11

483
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
11 out of 80

484
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
So

485
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
I don't know how to help

486
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,119
What what what what do we make of that number

487
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,727
I mean sweet weekend if we replicate fewer papers and we should have a

488
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Expected by

489
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Statistical power

490
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,543
Yeah right

491
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,591
Fun. Sounds is a bit disappointed

492
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
On its face it seems like

493
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,943
At least this replication project had a higher

494
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
Success rate than the psychology one

495
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,575
But honest as that is actually not the right way to look at it because

496
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
The two different projects.

497
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,671
Psych replication in the econ replication

498
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:16,255
They use different criteria for picking which studies to replicate

499
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
She also made another sort of big toe

500
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
And that is

501
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
A lot of economic studies

502
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,679
These are not these kinds of control.

503
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Experiments

504
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:31,103
A lot of the time Economist go and get existing data from The Real World you know from the IRS or

505
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,247
From a big school district or whatever and then they crunch that data and come up with a result that they publishing a paper

506
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,551
Anna says in the last few years

507
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,903
Other researchers have started reanalyzing some of those kinds of studies

508
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,207
Going back in re crunching the data

509
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,023
And they've been finding worrying signs there too

510
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
And we talked about the meaning of halt

511
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
I mean I will say look

512
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:57,215
The end of this for me as a person who

513
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,055
Like science believes in science

514
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
Disappointing

515
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
Like I am death

516
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Ya no me to

517
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:15,391
But I don't think that things can improve and like this reputation movement started by Bryan 06

518
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
Fantastic

519
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:22,304
Things are things are better people are more skeptical now is hard to do besides a solid wood

520
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,120
Tiny sample sizes finding something

521
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,448
Amazing about extrasensory perception or whatever

522
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
I'm upset

523
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
That's good

524
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,360
For the record

525
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,688
A bunch of people did try to replicate that original

526
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:42,016
Extrasensory perception study that ESP study

527
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
They could not do it

528
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
