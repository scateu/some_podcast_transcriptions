1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:04,608
If you have a car that you want to Rally people around

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,400
It helps to have an MS

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,936
A bad guy

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,216
You promise you will fight

5
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,240
Tom and Jerry

6
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,520
Batman the Joker

7
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,544
Politicians

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,640
Notice and basically every politician who's ever run for office

9
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,176
Pit himself against

10
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,200
The same

11
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
I will not back down

12
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,272
We're going to set up a

13
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:26,624
War room we're going to focus intensively that is outdoor and Barraco

14
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Declaring war

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
On the one thing that they

16
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
George Bush

17
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,512
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump

18
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
Can all agree

19
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560
Let's

20
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840
Cut the red

21
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,376
Taped to the bureaucracy

22
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,448
No red tape the red tape red

23
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,984
Tape regulations

24
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,544
Anime accused of all kinds of crimes

25
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,824
Jobs death

26
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,592
Savannah vacation

27
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
The demise of

28
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,920
Small business and this battle the promised

29
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,224
Defeat red tape once and for all

30
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,016
It was a big part of Donald Trump's kids

31
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,808
These ridiculous

32
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
Rules and regulations

33
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
Stop making a pause

34
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,416
Possible for you to come pick

35
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,720
So we're going to take that off

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,072
And less than 12 months after Trump

37
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
Took office

38
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
Declared Victory against

39
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Red tape

40
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,240
Never-ending growth of red tape in America is come

41
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
To a sudden

42
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,568
Screeching and beautiful Hall

43
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
Beautifulhalo

44
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
And then he said

45
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
We are just getting

46
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712
At this press conference

47
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:29,344
Trump stood in front of to mounds of papers which were surrounded by 8 literal band of red tape

48
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,416
He pointed at one stack of papers that's

49
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,952
Way taller than the other over

50
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
A tall tale

51
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,792
Him so this is what we have now

52
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,864
This stack he said it is all of America's

53
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,680
Current regulation 185000 page

54
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
Gauges 7.3

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
The other stack. Shorter maybe like

56
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
1 foot high

57
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,824
This is where we were in 1960

58
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
This mini stack is he said

59
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
All the regulations that existed

60
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
In 1960

61
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Wayfair

62
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
I'm your twenties house

63
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
And then he made a promise

64
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,112
That when he's finished cutting regulations

65
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,928
We will be less than where we were in nineteen

66
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,744
And then with a giant pair of scissors in his hands

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
1

68
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
2

69
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
3

70
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
That is the speech we found an actual red tape being cut

71
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,472
To get back to that 1960 stack of paper

72
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
It would mean

73
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
Dumping

74
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
160

75
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
T5000 pages of rules in the recycle

76
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,152
Reducing the current amount of rules

77
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
I-94

78
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
Percent

79
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
Fighting regulation

80
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
Takes more than a big

81
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
Pair of scissors

82
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
I mean adding regulations can take

83
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:38,976
Months sometimes years and actually getting rid of a rule it can mean the same long and tedious process

84
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
In River

85
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm caring definition.

86
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
Maxwell's market today on the show

We go into the battle

88
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:53,824
How to find out has Trump at last defeated the photo that has tumbled every president

89
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,920
To answer that question we will take you to a vending machine on the front lines of

90
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
Environmental regulation

91
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224

Discover the most important number no one's ever heard of and we'll introduce you to America's most powerful

93
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Rule taming weapon

94
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
Weapon that can only be wielded

95
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,816
If many stars magically align state did very recently and we behold it

96
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Power

Is available at aecf. Org

105
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
We called in an egg

106
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,720
Expert to help us understand how we got all this regulation

107
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
Quickly took an unexpectedly person

108
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
Turn Denver find yourself

109
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,608
In front of the fridge

110
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
Just kind of seeing what's in there

111
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Right

112
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
Maybe last night I don't want to

113
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,288
Talk about it sure it happens to all of us

114
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,104
This is Bridget dooling she's a professor at George Washing

115
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
Hampton University

116
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,480
But if maybe before you open the fridge you said am I actually hungry

117
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,296
You know you might have realized that perhaps you were thirsty

118
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
Or maybe you're just bored

119
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,136
Or you know maybe something else is on your mind

120
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,440
There is a whole agency tasked with curbing reggae

121
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,536
It's called the office of information and Regulatory Affairs Roi

122
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,095
Bridget work there under President Bush

123
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
And Obama and under President Trump

124
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
I like to think of Ira as

125
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
The nun judgy friend

126
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
Stand in front of the fridge and

127
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
When the EPA or the

128
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
FDA the USDA

129
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Come looking for a snack

130
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Oh Ira is there

131
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Simply asking

132
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,783
What are you doing their government what's the problem that you're trying

133
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
Do you really need to put 1154 rules on Goat Farmers is a real

134
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
Number if you're saved

135
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:51,071
The EPA and you want to make a regulation you have to justify yourself to Ira

136
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
Tell them what problem you're solving

137
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,679
And proved that the benefits outweigh the costs

138
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
13 stair

139
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
He wanted to rule you have to just

140
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
And if you want to remove a rule

141
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
You also have to justify that

142
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
Which is a big part of white

143
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
Regulation

144
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Just take soda

145
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Damn long

146
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Wichita

147
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,879
Usually takes so damn long because there is a very powerful weapon

148
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
And the Congress

149
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,207
Can use to sidestep the long slog and just

150
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
3 2 1 cut the red tape

151
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
The regulatory weapon of which we

152
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
We speak

153
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
Congressional

154
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Review act or the

155
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Cra

156
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
Yeah she did a whole episode on this

157
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,519
CRA was created in 1996 basically

158
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
Stop lame duck presidents

159
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,895
I'm going on a last-minute regulations free on their way out to

160
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,503
It's been described as soon as Cinderella rushing home after the ball

161
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
You know these projects

162
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
It's their last chance

163
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
To get them done

164
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,951
We call it the midnight regulations. President Obama he issued somewhere around a hundred

165
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
And 40 midnight regulation

166
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
This way out

167
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
Which by the way to a hundred

168
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
This is where the Congressional review

169
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
The CRA

170
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,983
Congress undo any regulation issued in the previous

171
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,287
60 legislative days like that

172
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
Except

173
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
The president can just veto it

174
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
You can undo the undo if he wants to

175
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Which is why

176
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,271
Why the magical power of the CRA is only really used

177
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
Once in a political Blue Moon

178
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,903
You got to have a party change in the White House and you've got to have a congress

179
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
That is opposed to the prior

180
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,303
Administration's rule in the only time that happens is

181
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
Say for instance

182
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
Will be

183
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
The 45th

184
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
And with that stars were aligning

185
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
For the Congressional review Act

186
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
To be used

187
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,895
Before this the CRA only been used

188
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
Once

189
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Just once

190
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Is 2001

191
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,783
To strike down of all things a new rule about organized

192
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
So if your office

193
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,111
The stairs suck you can blame the CRA

194
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,439
But because it had only ever been used one time

195
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,767
You know we didn't we didn't really know what to expect

196
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
As soon as Trump

197
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
Got into office

198
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
Congress took those

199
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,887
Big scissors and they started cutting

200
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,239
Down with State funding for abortion providers recording work injuries

201
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
And the resource management

202
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,079
Planning Rule and 11 others

203
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
By the time the regulation Carnage

204
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Complete

205
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
Congress used the CRA

206
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
To kill 14 rules

207
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,319
Just a few months into his term courtesy of the CRA Trump was off to a guy

208
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
Until

209
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
May 15th

210
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
2017

211
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
When the Clock Struck

212
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
60 legislative days

213
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
And the CRA

214
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Turned into a pub

215
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,351
Soap from here on out pools would have to be killed

216
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
The hard way

217
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,679
Good old-fashioned months and years long

218
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Deregulation

219
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
Trump talked a big game about this to

220
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,103
On the campaign Trail even promised a very specific plan for cutting red

221
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
To shrink the government in general

222
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:50,015
I will work with Congress to require that for every 1 new regulation

223
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
Two old regulations must

224
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,135
Be immediately Eliminator

225
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
1 in

226
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
2 out

227
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:04,095
This sounds like something you would make up on the campaign Trail just like nice-sounding Words pulled out of a hat

228
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
But it's a real policy other countries do this

229
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,055
The UK has a version of it Canada adopted a few years ago and just days after Trump took office

230
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
So did ameri

231
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
One of the first things that Trump did as president

232
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,455
What sign is name on Executive Order 137

233
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
N71

234
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
I did right there

235
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,063
In the federal book of rules on page 9000

236
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Running

237
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,439
Two out also the money has to break even on new

238
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
And old radio

239
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
So it has to

240
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,815
Federal government is giving vcigo they are really doing

241
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,167
We set a target of adding zero new regulatory cost

242
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Onto the America

243
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Can economy

244
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,311
Today I'm proud to announce that we beat our goal

245
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
BioLife

246
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,151
Trump has bragged about this kind of thing a few times over

247
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:54,783
The government actually measures that they now put out a yearly report card up out there.

248
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:01,951
Congress and different people have parsed the report different ways but everyone we ask said yes

249
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Trump is holding up his promise

250
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
At least two old rules

251
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
Are going out for every new one

252
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
Regulations by the numbers are going

253
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,215
It might not keep going at that same page

254
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
Trump started with the easiest thing

255
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
To deregulate

256
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:23,455
We talked with Wayne Crews he studies rules at the competitive Enterprise Institute the libertarian Think Tank

257
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,479
You said there are

258
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Too many rules

259
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
The low-hanging fruit

260
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,343
In terms of the two for one

261
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,951
And if you're still recording this is fine but the low-hanging fruit is probably being

262
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:40,095
And for there to be a real regulatory streamlining that goes beyond that you're going to have to have

263
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Congressional a

264
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Big deer

265
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
Can takes Congress pass

266
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
Laws that sweep away dozens

267
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,263
Hundreds or thousands of rules

268
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,383
The time the real impact so far of trump and his two-for-one policy when says

269
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
Is on future regulation

270
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
Agencies

271
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,503
Are thinking twice before they issue new rules now

272
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
So we get

273
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Fewer new rules

274
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
One thing he has certainly

275
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Effectively done

276
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
Put a freeze on you

277
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
Major regulation

278
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,583
You just simply not seeing a lot of new heavy duty regulation

279
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
Come down the pipeline and Trump

280
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,167
Destruction that's quite significant

281
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
In fact Bridget dueling the former regulator that we talked to earlier she studied the pace of new regulations under Trump

282
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
And she found that in the first year and a half

283
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
At the Trump

284
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
The amount of new regulation

285
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
Is down 70%

286
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Compared to Obama

287
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
70%

288
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
And compared to Bush he's down 60

289
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
6%

290
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
This is a big

291
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
Change Trump is

292
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
Fundamentally changing the pay

293
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
But

294
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,071
Bridget points out that stopping the flow of new regulations

295
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
Does not do anything to end

296
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
Do the stock

297
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Of old ones

298
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,471
Tens of thousands of rules are piled up over decades

299
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,567
And even with a two-for-one policy taking away old regulations

300
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
That's barely making a

301
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,895
In every aspect of your car

302
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
It's probably somehow captured by regulation

303
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Whether it's

304
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:07,391
The food you eat for breakfast the rules around the way work is conducted in your workplace all of that is subject to Marriott

305
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
Add federal regulations that have grown up

306
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Overtime

307
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,255
So something like a two-for-one

308
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,327
That's her chips away at 1 or 2

309
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,959
Is never going to reach the level of deregulatory activity that the President says he wants to achieve

310
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
If I going back to 19

311
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,615
But maybe accomplishing the goal of deregulation getting the big hand

312
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
Have government out of the way

313
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
It can be done without

314
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,759
Actually having to repeal regulations by just looking for

315
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Smaller waist

316
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
The kind of tweaked the road

317
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
Very deep in those stacks of pages of rules

318
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
If you can find just the right line to

319
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
To change in just the right time anyway

320
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,023
You can have a pretty big impact

321
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,399
I'm at 1 I am going to give up the chair to Jason beaubien NPR's Global help desk

322
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
Who picks up the story hey Jason

323
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Thanks Alex

324
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
Alright I'm going to head out here and let you

325
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
To take it all right

326
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
Hey Karen hey Jason

327
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,639
The understand what the Trump Administration is doing here

328
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
We have to first

329
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
Step back and look at what the Obama Administration

330
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,783
Getting creative with regulations to push through it

331
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
Environmental agenda

332
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
And it all has to do with

333
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,183
The most important number no one's ever heard of

334
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
He's a professor at the University of Chicago

335
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,303
And that mysterious number that no one's ever heard of

336
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Is the social cost of

337
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Carbon

338
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
The social

339
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,191
Cost of carbon are the monetized damages

340
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
From the release of an additional ton of CO2

341
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Basically

342
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
How much does 1 ton of carbon dioxide

343
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
Released into the air

344
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Buy anything from

345
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
Cars at Power Plant

346
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,247
How much will that one ton of carbon dioxide cost the world

347
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Because

348
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,831
Apologies for stating the obvious here but

349
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
Carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere of course

350
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Stays up there for deca

351
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
Attaching Heat global warming

352
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
It could affect

353
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,399
Agricultural production in Bangladesh worker productivity in Texas or life expectancy in Egypt

354
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
CO2 emissions

355
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,959
Lots of impacts on Lots

356
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,543
Stop Obama really wanted to do something about global warming

357
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
So he tried to get Congress to

358
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
To pass laws

359
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,431
But Congress said no we're not into that so he turned

360
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
2 regulation

361
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Which meant

362
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
He then have to justify that the

363
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
The benefit of reducing emissions

364
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Be greater than the cost

365
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
To say,

366
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
To do that

367
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,719
You have to be able to calculate how much

368
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
Damaged

369
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
Carbon dioxide

370
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
Which brings us back

371
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
Back to the social coffee

372
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Carbon

373
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
The dollar value

374
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
On the damage

375
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
One ton of

376
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,543
Michael and his colleagues job was to calculate that value

377
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Which is very very

378
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,431
They were plugging numbers into economic models that would just make your heads

379
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,527
That looks like one of them is what is the proper assume disc

380
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,855
Tribution for the equilibrium climate sensitivity parameter and a house that

381
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
Nerdy definitely nerdy

382
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,999
But all of this is related to real world things

383
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,071
Like what is the impact of this pollution on people's health

384
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Open crops

385
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
An economic productivity

386
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
If you have to project that

387
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Around the world

388
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Way out

389
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
Indian Michael and his colleagues made of formula

390
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
Based on a mountain of economic research

391
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
And Wallah they had their number

392
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
$42

393
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
That number is like the

394
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
Keep

395
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,015
In

396
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,319
The ability of the US government

397
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
To pursue regulations

398
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Dad

399
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
Limit CO2 emission

400
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,487
And they started with the importance

401
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Your snack

402
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,351
So the first rule if I remember correctly

403
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
Was not the most glamorous rule

404
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
It was an energy efficiency

405
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Rule for finding the

406
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
The President Obama had found his

407
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,871
Creative way to do what he couldn't do by way of legislation

408
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
But those

409
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,711
To live by the sword Inc if I remember correctly they die

410
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
By the sword

411
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Yeah

412
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,111
And anything one president can do with a struggling Pan the next president can undo

413
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
With a bat or big scissors

414
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,535
Sure enough people came in and they said about undoing a bunch of environmental rules one by one

415
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
The slow laborious way

416
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
But they also found

417
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Creative way

418
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
The weekend almost

419
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
All climate regulation

420
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
At once

421
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
It was the Trump Administration has done

422
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
Is founded Isles

423
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
Honda has the assumptions

424
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,639
That would most easily

425
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
I reduce the number

426
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
Grab those two dials turn.

427
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Cracking all the way down

428
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
And then end up with

429
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,391
Very low estimates of the social cost of carbon

430
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,719
They took the social cost of carbon that $42 per ton

431
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
And a slash

432
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Twas the last

433
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
$1

434
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
There are

435
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
To dial

436
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
That they Crank 2

437
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
First

438
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
Rather than assume that

439
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
Us CO2 emission

440
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Have a global impact

441
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,775
They decided to take an America First approach

442
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
Can only count the domestic impact

443
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
About Peluche

444
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,687
Second they placed a very low value on the future damage

445
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
Apps that could occur from

446
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
So now if you want to cut down on pollution

447
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Cars

448
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
You do the analysis

449
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,135
On the one side there's the cost of the car,

450
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Making a bunch of change

451
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,487
And under Obama you could say that that cost is

452
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
It's worth it because

453
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,839
There's $42 of damage for each ton of pollution

454
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
But now under Trump

455
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
The damage is just a dollar

456
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Almost nothing

457
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
The United States government is known as

458
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
Extraordinary outlier

459
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
In its valuation of the damages of an additional ton of Steel

460
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,663
I'm unaware of any other

461
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,735
Government or researcher who has

462
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Concluded the

463
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
$1

464
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Is the right number

465
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
So now if you

466
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
If you want to propose making sweeping admissions changes

467
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
Best new cars

468
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
It's really hard to justify anymore

469
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
And of course

470
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,327
The atmosphere doesn't care what number any

471
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
Wooden plugs into a

472
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:43,007
Okay we've gone through a lot of ways that Trump is changing regulations worth the little recap

473
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Absolutely

474
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
All right

475
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,383
The Trump Administration has definitely stemmed the tide of

476
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
New regulation

477
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
But getting rid of that

478
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,015
6 foot stack all those rules that were made in the past

479
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
That still stands tall

480
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,879
They're not on Pace to get to Trump School of nineteen

481
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
60 levels not even close

482
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,207
But they are chipping away at rules

483
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,791
Through the normal TDS channels and looking for other ways

484
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Peking duck carbon number

485
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,679
This stuff is so complicated we only got to a small fraction

486
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
Of what we wanted to

487
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
So

488
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Obviously

489
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
We decided that we would just

490
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,615
Have to cram everything that we couldn't get to
