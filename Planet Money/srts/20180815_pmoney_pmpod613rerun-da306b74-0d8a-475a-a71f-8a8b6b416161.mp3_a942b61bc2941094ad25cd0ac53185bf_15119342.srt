00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,536
Hey Stacey Vanek Smith

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:04,864
And today we are replaying an episode I originally reported back in

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,912
2015 about recycle

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,984
A lot has changed in the world recycling

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,752
Bend soap

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,824
Please stay tuned we will have an update for you at the end of the show

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,920
A little while back engineers at MIT

8
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
He's really small

9
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:23,552
Electronic tracking devices

10
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,112
Just the one inch by half an inch and very very sick

11
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,648
This is Carlo Rossi

12
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416
Who ran the

13
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,976
They wanted to track something that is all around us

14
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,512
But that is otherwise

15
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
Pretty and visit

16
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,304
Crush

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
Yes trash garbage

18
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,680
They did this in Seattle and they asked residents to bring in a

19
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,704
Piece of trash

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
And people did anything

21
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:46,336
From a from an old cell phone to fluorescent lights

22
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
Two banana peels

23
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
Can you put a tracker on a banana peel

24
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,224
Of course people brought all kinds of stuff

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,856
Somebody came to ask me the teddy bear and you Linda in the end she told us that it was a teddy bear she's being

26
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
Having all of your life

27
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,976
But actually now she had to throw it away from boyfriend was telling her

28
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,048
Songs by association

29
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,912
I think you threw out the boyfriend not the teddy bear

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,472
But anyway I'm a thousand percent

31
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
Is there all this that bad

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
And they watched

33
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,616
A lot of the trash ended up getting recycled

34
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,920
And it may be surprisingly long trip like a

35
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,760
Across the country sometimes you could see an item go.....

36
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,808
LaPorte and then.....

37
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Out to sea

38
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,160
It was amazing to see how how many times has am I see some things

39
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,000
I've been looking into the recycling business and it's amazing

40
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,792
A lot of our plastic gets shipped

41
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
To China where gets turned into

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
Toothbrushes and carpet and

43
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,936
Fleece jackets get sold back to us

44
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
And a lot of our shredded documents

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,824
Get sent to Mexico where they're turned into paper towels and

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Tissue papers and toilet paper

47
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:57,248
I love that are shredded documents get turned into toilet paper so some of the stuff this MIT project tract

48
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
GATRA Psych

49
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
But other stuff

50
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Got thrown out

51
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,416
Those items didn't go so far lot of them ended up with a short trip to Atlanta

52
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
What is recyclable and what is

53
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,024
Turns out there's an economic

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
Line between the two

55
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
It's like they can move around alot

56
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
One day it's profitable to recycle a bottle and the next day some global economic number changes and that

57
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
That same bottle is trash

58
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200

61
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
Every Thursday I do what

82
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,120
A lot of people probably do I haul a blue bin of my recycling out to the street

83
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
To be taken away

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,520
What's in your bin newspapers in yogurt containers in soda bottles things like that

85
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,128
Like New York daily news and full-fat yogurt more like Wall Street Journal ends

86
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
But no fat yoga

87
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
Service where you got to see where it actually went

88
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
I followed my yogurt container and

89
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
Wall Street Journal to see

90
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
Who picks it up where it goes and

91
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
The business behind it

92
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,440
It goes to another part of Brooklyn soap

93
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
A producer here you've been in and I

94
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
When to check it out

95
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
I went to go under a very shady looking Highway overpass and through this abandoned warehouse District

96
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
The cold they were walking up to a guard booth

97
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
I meant 10 security

98
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
River slowly Frozen you can see Ikea

99
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Oh my gosh

100
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Cranes

101
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Bales of garbage

102
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
We're definitely here

103
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,088
This kind of looks like where you would dump a body

104
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,184
Stacy what's your plan

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,536
Man comes forward as he's tall he has red hair

106
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,351
Looks like he just walked out of an LL Bean catalog

107
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
His name is Tom Outerbridge

108
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Hello

109
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Hi are you Tom

110
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Is this your dog

111
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Stacy you love dogs

112
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,591
It's true I do I do have a soft spot

113
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,479
Tom has this place and it's one of many operated by a company called Sims Recycling Solutions

114
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
And every hour this one place processes

115
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
14000 lb of

116
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Yogurt containers and pet

117
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
Pepsi cans in Wall Street Journal

118
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
And I found this weirdly exciting my garbage comes here

119
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Termite my recycling

120
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
I'm sorry

121
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
Is it bad to call the garbage

122
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,471
Yeah I'm going to say well we don't call garbage because we're not really in the garbage business minutes

123
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,055
That people make that mistake all the time

124
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
So awkward

125
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
I know it was

126
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Tomatillo

127
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:10,527
You can kind of tell David is sort of a quiet guy he kept turning away from my microphone

128
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
Jade Gardens recycling

129
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,903
Because he wanted to do something to help the environment

130
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:20,767
But he's the first person to tell me that recycling is a business that's actually a huge business

131
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
What did you say it's like hundreds of billions or something

132
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,607
A hundred billion dollars yeah

133
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:29,215
So you have to think about this as a business understand the problems the recycling business

134
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
It haven't right

135
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,823
Go to make sense for him to recycle something he has to be able to

136
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
Make a profit

137
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
If you can then that thing is recite

138
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,431
If you can't then it

139
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
It's trash

140
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,015
Trash recycling those are really economic ideas

141
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,575
Yammy misplace it cost alot to run

142
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:49,439
Tom shows me around he takes me to this enormous machine called The Liberator

143
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,767
Cuz it Liberate the various valuable pieces of recycling

144
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Exactly

145
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,119
They're just conveyor belt everywhere going in every direction

146
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,679
Indianapolis electronic sorting machine

147
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
It's sort of like

148
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory

149
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Except for garbage

150
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
Not garbage recycle

151
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
All right

152
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,407
Just the beginning of the sorting system here

153
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
We use magnets to pull out Metal review

154
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
Ballistic separator

155
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,111
To separate paper and plastic bags from bottles

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,719
Tom tells me what is trash and what's recycling has been changing a lot late

157
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
You just made this one thing

158
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
Right on the border between

159
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
Trash and recyclables

160
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
It's plastic

161
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,471
Bags for secondary belt right in front of us full plastic bags to River of them

162
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
I know we've got like bubble wrap and a

163
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,103
Target bag in a Dunkin Donuts bag plastic bags can be

164
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Valuable commodity

165
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,455
Tom could sell them to clients in Asia

166
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
And they would use them to make

167
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,319
Toothbrushes and carpet and coffee makers and things like that

168
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,927
But recently plastic bags have not been selling very well Tom can't get a good price for them

169
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
Plastic braces are off almost 50% about

170
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Wow

171
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
That's a lot

172
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
Not shoot

173
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
The reason for the Stacey I would not have guessed

174
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Anaplastic

175
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
Business it is

176
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
Primarily I would say due to the

177
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
Dropping oil prices

178
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Oil

179
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,895
The oil seems like something may be totally unrelated but of course

180
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
Plastic bag

181
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
ARA petroleum

182
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
They're made from oil

183
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
So if oil gets cheap

184
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
That means it's cheap

185
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
To make fresh

186
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Plastic

187
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
So if you're in the business of making toothbrushes

188
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
It's cheaper to buy freshly made

189
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
Advantages to buy recycled

190
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
Stuck at waste recycle plastic

191
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Plastic bag

192
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
Yeah this is especially true for flask

193
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,655
Because we need a lot of processing before you can

194
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,215
Can use the plastic in there to be washed

195
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
X many times

196
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
And they also tend to get

197
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,591
Stuck in machine gears and gum up the works so

198
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
It cost a lot of money to recycle

199
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,759
The largest recycler in the country a company called Waste Management recently gave up on recycling plastic bags

200
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
Altogether they just couldn't make money in it

201
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,623
Time in Brooklyn says he is still trying to make it work

202
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
But it stopped

203
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,975
This is really sort of the bottom of them

204
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
The Barrel in terms of the class

205
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
6 Market

206
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
Is the value of it is relatively low which means

207
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
We can't afford to put a lot of

208
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,727
Time and money into trying to recycle

209
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,639
And so then what happens to the plastic bags if you can't sell them

210
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Borderline

211
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
Trump says he's not having any trouble selling

212
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Higher quality

213
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,551
Plastic things like detergent bottles and soda bottles

214
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,111
But the price for those has dropped and have to

215
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
Fight so that's the misery on the plastic side of things

216
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,511
There's also great unhappiness in this other part of the recycling bin

217
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Is it that

218
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,631
Is actually a huge part of the market account for something like 90% of our recycled export

219
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Paper

220
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,239
Time takes me to another part of the processing plant

221
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:46,079
And there are pizza boxes and office paper and cereal boxes here

222
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
This is your milk carton

223
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
Oh yeah

224
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,735
And milk and juice carton

225
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,807
Is this high quality or low quality this is actually very high quality

226
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,671
Surprisingly you wouldn't know necessarily but this we sell two paper mills

227
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,231
Where the Saudi Arabia of recovered paper

228
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,143
That is Bill Moore he runs a consulting firm that advises recycling companies

229
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,495
To understand the paper problem you need to know one key

230
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:18,079
Most of our use paper get sold to one place

231
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
One very big

232
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,711
China is the 800-pound gorilla when it comes to using recovered paper there

233
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,295
They don't have many trees softwood trees so they

234
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,135
All their capacity to make boxes and newspapers all

235
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,671
100% Recycled Fiber

236
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,231
In normal times this is a very happy relationship

237
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:40,095
Newspaper that you read if you're still read hardcopy newspaper witch

238
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
If you put that in your recycling bin six weeks later someone in China could read their newspaper on the same

239
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Same fiber

240
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,103
The problem is that recently China has not been buying a

241
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
As much of our paper

242
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
I've been getting a lot of it

243
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
From Europe instead

244
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
And the reason is the most boring thing you can

245
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
International currency

246
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,879
Base of the dollar has been getting stronger the Euro has been getting

247
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
Which means us

248
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,999
Recycle paper is more expensive than European recycle

249
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
Paper if your China

250
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
Out there at deciding where to buy from

251
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,935
Tom Outerbridge in Brooklyn and told me he's been on the phone a lot lately with clients in China

252
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Cutting all these deals

253
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,751
But he does not want to cut

254
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,359
In good days a ton of paper sells for about $150

255
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
And these days Tom says it's selling for Less

256
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
The half that like

257
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,759
50 or $60 for a ton

258
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,599
And buyers are literally nickeling and diming him on this like

259
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
Can you sell it for $0.10 Less can you sell

260
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
For $0.05

261
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
Five ten cents can make it

262
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,559
You're negotiating around a penny or half penny

263
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
That's really weird

264
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,215
To make things worse for Tom China has also recently started recycling a lot of its own trash

265
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
So bad

266
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
They don't need as much

267
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,591
American office paper and milk carton so much anymore

268
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
Hard time to be a recycler

269
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
David Steiner is the CEO of waste

270
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Management

271
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
It's the largest recycling company in

272
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
I don't think crisis

273
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Drawing of a word

274
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
To say that you're seeing a crisis

275
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
And

276
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
The recycling in

277
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Throughout the United States

278
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,583
So you're seeing recycling company small recycling companies go out of business

279
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
Left and right

280
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
You really are

281
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,471
Recycling exports of actually started to drop a little bit

282
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:27,615
But Steiner thinks this could continue as prices drop and private companies stop being able to make money recycling

283
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
Some place like California have policy

284
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Citic mandate

285
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
Sinuses nose cases

286
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
The extra cost

287
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Contacts

288
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,087
Other places are just recycling less stuff

289
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
Lots of places have given up on plastic bag

290
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,975
Waste management is shutting down some of its less profitable plant

291
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,791
Tom Outerbridge the guy who recycles your yoga

292
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Red containers in newspaper

293
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,143
Bruce says the recycling business has always had its good years and it's bad years

294
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
This just feels like a particularly bad stretch

295
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
Is profit margins are getting thinner in

296
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Tencent

297
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
He doesn't want to send stuff to landfill

298
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
Has that ever happened before

299
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
Osher

300
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
Domino's our worst case scenario

301
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,551
Environmentally and also for the business

302
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,647
Tom does not want to give up not even on plastic bags

303
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
He's hired someone called a

304
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Picker to stand

305
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
The plastic bag conveyor belt and Palatka

306
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Contaminants

307
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
And bad plastic bags

308
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,095
So only the good ones get through

309
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,887
So he can sell them for a higher power

310
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,775
The hope is that he can use this to move the line a little bit between trash and recycle

311
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,103
Be so much easier if the price of oil just went off of

312
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,687
Don't know if that's an easier way but as you know

313
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,247
I have no control over our Global oil prices

314
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
Pac-12 public service announcement

315
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
Oh yes

316
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
You can't recycle bowling balls

317
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,999
Apparently in Brooklyn a lot of people try

318
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
I'm has to pick them out

319
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327

00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,407
Hello it is Stacy from the present day and has been changing in the world over cycle

339
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:41,759
Namely China decided it did not want to take the world's recyclable

340
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
And so

341
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
January

342
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,135
China implemented something called the national sword policy

343
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,463
Which is essentially a ban on foreign paper and plastic

344
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,791
This was a huge deal for the recycling industry

345
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
Biz before this

346
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
China recycled about half the world's paper

347
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
Plastic Prada

348
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,495
When I heard about this new policy of course I thought of Tom Outerbridge

349
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,055
Give me the whole business of selling paper and plastic

350
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
China

351
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,151
And I thought surely his world must be totally upside down

352
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
Portions of

353
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
The world upside down

354
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
First class

355
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
What time does the ban on plastic

356
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
Because not really affect

357
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
He already stopped sending faster

358
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,207
China a few years ago because of a different Chinese

359
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,255
This policy called the green fence

360
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,815
MP started selling to domestic buyers

361
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,887
Put on the paper side of things it's a bit more complicated

362
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
Because Tom was still sending paper to China

363
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
So now he's looking for alternative places to ship it

364
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,847
He says they've rerouted their paper to other Southeast Asian countries

365
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
Entergy MS

366
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Byers

367
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
That comes with a cost

368
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
Paper of the negative value today

369
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
Meaning you don't get paid for it

370
