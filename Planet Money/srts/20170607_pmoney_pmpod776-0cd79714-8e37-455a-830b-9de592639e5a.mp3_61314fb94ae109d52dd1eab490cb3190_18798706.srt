1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,560
There is no one who is more optimistic

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,632
More Sunny than a politician who is writing a budget

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,192
And we just saw this in Donald Trump's budget this

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,728
In order to make the numbers work

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,776
Trump makes this big assumption

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:15,104
The economy is going to expand and grow every year

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,384
Nothing but Blue Skies

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,920
Unicorns rainbows

9
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,992
If there is a number that sums up this Rosy picture

10
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,064
Trump's budget assumes that the US economy will speed up

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,880
And grow by 3% a year over the next decade

12
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
3%

13
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,024
Minimum pay for this is from Fox News

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,632
At some point

15
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,168
Into the future

16
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,704
5 and above

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,640
How to respect the optimism when you put it that way I mean growing your car

18
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,200
3% me 3% sounds easy

19
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
If someone

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Hey

21
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
2.3% no problem at 7

22
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
40%

23
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,208
IPhone economy besides the United States

24
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
3% growth

25
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,768
Is incredibly difficult

26
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,072
In President Obama's first budget

27
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
He promised more than 3%

28
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,168
Growth and year after year we never got

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
And you can think of it this way

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,104
To grow 3% a year for 10 years means that in a decade the US economy would be a third larger

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
It is now

32
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
That is a lot of growth

33
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,968
Currently the US economy is growing at around a real rate

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
2%

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,064
Donald Trump could get us to 3% growth

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
He would be an economic hero

37
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
Improbable

38
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,952
But it is not impossible

39
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
So we got to thinking here

40
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
What would it take

41
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,096
What would it take for Donald Trump's economic vision

42
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
To come true

43
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
Could we

44
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,472
Come up with a plan to get the United States to 3% growth

45
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,592
You know Robert it is like what that cartoon from Schoolhouse Rock used to say

46
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
Schoolhouse Rock

47
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:58,272
What's the magic number

48
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:03,904
The magic number Blind welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith Robert Smith

49
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
3%

50
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
Bro

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,584
If Donald Trump is right we are about to enter a new golden age of jobs and progress

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
Increase the size of the military we can cut taxes when you build a wall roads Bridges sky's the limit

53
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
3% is doable

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Show we make a plan to get there

55
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
Play Problem

56
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,016
Donald Trump probably is not going to like

57
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
What it's going to take

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,464

Okay we're going to do something today that we almost never do

67
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,904
We're going to come up with policy and do some math

68
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
To see how it all works out

69
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
We've sharpen some pencils

70
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
Here at the Planet Money studios in New York

71
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,840
And we've invited an expert into our Studios

72
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
NBC

73
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,216
So I'm hearing a bunch of things moving around sorry about that

74
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
But you're literally rolling up your sleep

75
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,800
Yeah well we're doing budgeting

76
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,408
Mark gold mine is the policy director with the committee for a responsible federal budget

77
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
Their nonpartisan group

78
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Deep into the weeds

79
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,040
How the government spends money started by Republicans

80
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
And Democrat

81
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,904
I never made a president's budget I have served on two commissions

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,488
Where we had to make a series of recommendations and add actually add up

83
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,840
When the president's budget came out Mark was really looking forward to seeing how it added up

84
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
He started looking through when he saw this number

85
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
3%

86
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Economic growth

87
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
He's like

88
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,800
The president doesn't say anything about how he's going to make this happen just

89
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Will happen

90
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,664
Impact Trump's budget advisor said the core of trumponomics is to

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
To pick a number to pick a dream

92
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
And work your way toward that

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
Aspirational

94
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Economics

95
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:14,464
So Marcus group decided to do the math that the president left out he was going to figure out exactly what it would

96
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
3% growth is

97
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,583
Possible hit absolutely everything goes right at the same time

98
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
And that means everything going right

99
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
In terms of policy

100
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
And it means everything going right in terms of luck

101
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
Okay so let's break this

102
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Thing.

103
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,079
Economic growth is measured in

104
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Gross domestic

105
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,943
Product this is the sum of all the goods and services we produce every

106
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Year in the economy

107
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
And there was plenty of time

108
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
When the GDP grew more than

109
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
Percent of year

110
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,879
A lot of those times have to do with

111
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:49,279
The Baby Boomers always the Baby Boomers the Baby Boomers will bring the 1960s when the first wave of baby boomers were starting to get dry

112
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
There were more people working

113
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,631
More workers means more stuff

114
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
And that equal to Grant County

115
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,519
Same thing in the 1990s the Baby Boomers were reaching their Peak earning years

116
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
Card making stuff

117
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,383
There was this technological boom and computers and the internet

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
The economy grew really fast

119
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:11,551
From now is that the Baby Boomers always the Baby Boomers retire and we've been struggling to get

120
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
Just

121
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
2%

122
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
San Marcos team came up with soda

123
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
3

124
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
General

125
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
3 biggest economy

126
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
We can effect

127
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
To make sure that

128
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
The first one is to find someone

129
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,143
Anyone really who can take the Baby Boomers place

130
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
Need to find more work

131
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,727
Once again more workers make more stuff

132
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
Provide more services and

133
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Make the GDP go up

134
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,895
That's exactly right and so one of the tools that folks have discussed with run the economy

135
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,919
Is more immigration

136
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,783
But first get 3% growth we would basically need to double our immigrant

137
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Over the next decade

138
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,927
Wake me up existing immigrant immigrants today

139
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
That are here today

140
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,487
Some of them have been here for as much as

141
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
What's a 80 years

142
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,607
Right so we need to take the last 80 years of immigration

143
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
And do it again in the next

144
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,215
If we roughly did that if we roughly double the amount of

145
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Immigrants

146
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
That could get us

147
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Theory

148
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Something at least

149
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Close to free

150
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,407
Women it sounds like you should much more growth than 3%

151
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
For that many people take that millions of people

152
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
Play what about 40 to 50 million

153
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
People

154
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,319
But remember

155
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
When economy

156
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
At starting with about

157
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
350 million people

158
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,719
And also remember we're not only having

159
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
Adult working-age working immigrants

160
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
Right immigrants would also

161
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,119
Two children and the elderly and people that

162
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,935
Eventually would become disabled or otherwise outside of the work for

163
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
So it's not like

164
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
We can pick people one by one and

165
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
Secured that every single one of them

166
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Is it going to be

167
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
Fast contributor to the Econo

168
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
40 million immigrants

169
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,759
Does not sound like something that President Trump would

170
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Support

171
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
I mean not only

172
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
Should you not build a wall at that point that you should

173
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:55,743
Actually charter buses to bring people over

174
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:01,631
What is the definition to show you how hard 3% growth is without the Baby Boomers

175
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
You need 40 million more immigrants

176
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
To make up for it

177
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,567
Okay so let's just assume that 40 million immigrants is politically unfair

178
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Right now okay

179
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,431
There's another way so one option is to actually look to the problem

180
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
For the solution

181
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
Part of the reason that

182
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,295
Our economy is slowing actually the main reason

183
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
Is that we're getting older

184
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
And part of that is because we're living longer

185
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,719
But embedded in that is a partial solution which is that

186
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
As we're living longer we're actually healthy

187
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
There's opportunity

188
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Press to work

189
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,351
On average

190
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
More years

191
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,447
Press to have more productive aging more flexible retirement

192
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,519
So otherwise keep the baby boomers around don't let them retire

193
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
I'm not saying don't let them retire

194
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
But if everybody just worked one year

195
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
More

196
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
There be a significant effect on economic

197
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
Navigate to 3%

198
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,807
But that would give us a decimal point or so

199
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,831
10 years more

200
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Might do it

201
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,183
The average retirement age right now is about 60

202
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,999
Evan said every work to 73

203
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
That might get us

204
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
Sitting very close to that free

205
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
What should we do to keep it working longer

206
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
Without mandating they have to work

207
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:14,079
We have a lot of signals we send people to tell them to retire early

208
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
The Social Security early age of 62

209
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
The normal age is 66

210
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Xn

211
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,551
Not really going to rise of life expectancy the Medicare e26

212
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
T5 you can pull out from your IRA at 59 and a half

213
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
You know we can start to

214
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695
Gradually lift these ages a little bit

215
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,791
We can create tax breaks like a payroll tax break for folks at work

216
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,607
We can change a lot of the regulations and rules

217
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Encourage employers

218
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
To keep people on

219
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Longer

220
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:45,567
Okay so just increasing the labor force alone unless we talked about really radical

221
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
Will not get us to 3 /

222
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,015
I mean that's right there's there's one more option for the labor force

223
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
So

224
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
There's also

225
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
Summerville untapped population

226
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:03,999
Currently right there is there are folks that are unemployed and are pugs that are out of the labor force.

227
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
I could be entering it

228
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
But if you took the unemployment rate down to zero

229
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Not even be close to 3

230
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239
Percent growth weed all set to do is take

231
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
Every single adult

232
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,847
H25 255 in every single prime age adult

233
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
And force them to work

234
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
And that includes folks that are

235
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
Homies are taking care of their kids

236
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,527
That includes folks that are in jail that are on disability

237
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,111
Include some folks that legitimately could be working with the right

238
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
Mexican citizen support

239
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
So we can get to 3% growth

240
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
It basically every single

241
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Adult

242
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,535
Every single working age adult

243
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
Was working

244
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
That's not a realistic view of the economy

245
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
I feel like my dad would be excited about

246
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,471
Everybody works no matter

247
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Newk's Q

248
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:51,103
I feel like you're a failure sick you got to work

249
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
OK Google

250
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
First set of ideas different ways to add more work

251
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,439
This is the most direct way to make up for the Baby Boomers but it's also

252
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,999
Insanely difficult to get people to work

253
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
When they don't want to

254
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,327
To drive people back from retirement

255
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
I mean people have a lot of reasons to

256
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Cannot

257
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Making

258
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:20,031
But let's set aside the workforce idea for now because there is another set of things that Trump could do to

259
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
To boost economic growth

260
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
And I think this one would be more up his alley

261
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,175
The second thing that drives economic growth is what we call

262
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
Capital and it's basically means

263
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,295
All of the machines buildings software

264
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
All the stuff that we use

265
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
To make more stuff

266
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Talk about

267
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,743
Right I mean more factories more stores every time something gets built

268
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
You get more economic growth

269
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
More government building projects

270
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Infrastructure

271
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Objects

272
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,679
Tools hammers microphone speakers

273
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,007
I use Excel Microsoft Excel that's one of my

274
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
Best pieces of capital in my job

275
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
We would need to basically double

276
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
Are Capital Growth projection over the next decade

277
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
And we would

278
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
Need to do significantly better about twice as well

279
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
We need to improve about twice as wild weed in the night

280
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
Summer in the 1990s we had the

281
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Tech Revolution

282
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
Means so much new software so much new it

283
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Fiber optic laid out in every

284
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
Street in America

285
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,911
SMS around in the nineties every office bought that big desktop

286
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Computer forever

287
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
What if their workers if your white collar worker

288
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
Exactly so back in the 1990's

289
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,895
There was some years we were growing over 4% and we were steady growth

290
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
That was in the

291
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Mid-height

292
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
If we were to do that again

293
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,807
If we were if something were invented

294
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,111
Every single office

295
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,927
Would absolutely have to buy whether it's

296
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
I don't know

297
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
Virtual reality or hologram something that just transforms

298
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
Business in a way

299
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,863
And in people have to pour money in Tampa

300
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Intuit

301
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
How much would we have to do

302
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
If we were to go back to the 90s level of Capital Growth

303
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
That would get us about two and a half

304
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Annual growth

305
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Ridecell

306
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
In round numbers were trying to jump from 2 to 3

307
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
And that would get us halfway there

308
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
So we would need to. Com booms

309
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
Going simultaneously at the same time

310
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
Now maybe we can get that with self-driving cars or something else

311
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
But I'm not seeing where that is right now

312
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Okay

313
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,023
Altitude.com booms

314
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,375
Concurrently to.com booms at the same time in different arenas

315
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,191
So we would need a golden age of

316
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,031
Whole new set of tools are factories are types of businesses that didn't occur

317
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
A lot of new

318
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,711
More likely more realistic if you would do a lot of little things that encourage businesses

319
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
So we talked to the podcast

320
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
Before about corporate tax

321
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,647
Reform a lower corporate tax could decision Theory get businesses

322
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
To expand

323
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
If it's done right a lot of

324
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,743
Those businesses that have moved

325
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Overseas

326
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
For tax reasons they might come back

327
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,143
You at all those together and Mark says you could get

328
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,215
Some fraction of a percent of economic

329
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Okay

330
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,823
So there is a final way that we could get to three

331
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
Without the new workers without the new fact

332
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,015
We could just all get a whole lot better at our jobs I've been saying that a lot of pictures

333
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Productivity

334
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:16,671
Productivity people get better and better each year and they produce more and more goods and services

335
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Each year

336
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
Then that alone will grow in economy

337
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Amazing

338
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Particular sense

339
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
Pronto Pizza

340
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Check the other two

341
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:29,727
Yeah magic as in you don't have to open the borders you don't have to convince businesses to buy all this new stuff

342
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
It's a sort of

343
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
Free Solution

344
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,615
But also magic and that no one really knows how productivity is

345
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,455
We just did a whole show about this and sometimes there's a lot of new inventions or

346
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
Technologies that transform everything about the

347
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
The way we work

348
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
But recently there's actually been a productivity slump in this

349
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,927
Even with the iPhone in the cloud in the internet and everything like that

350
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,767
Productivity hasn't really grown much over the last decade and we would have to have some

351
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Huge leap forward

352
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Kate at 3% growth

353
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
We need to do better than we did a 19

354
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,423
60s in the 1960s

355
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Which

356
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
It's hard to believe anything about

357
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,567
That's really when the benefits of

358
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
Electrification

359
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
Basically the entire country

360
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
The benefits of Home Appliance

361
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
Any benefits of

362
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
The National Highway

363
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,831
System we're all making our labor much more productive than it has ever been

364
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
And it's it's really not clear we can never repeat

365
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,951
Things that are so fundamental to our lives

366
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,279
That way we don't even think about what it would be like

367
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
So we need to find that next thing

368
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,911
That next productive idea that is fundamental to our lives

369
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
And I was going to change the way we do so

370
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
Wing it faster productivity

371
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:39,103
Three things we know how to do like more research and experimentation

372
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
Like better incentives

373
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Presta

374
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
Get higher returns

375
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
But together

376
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,039
Productivity Revolution like in the 1960s

377
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Way to find something we haven't even thought of

378
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,135
I've been reading books of Science Fiction

379
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,463
Lately it has occurred to me that perhaps science fiction writers

380
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
Should come up with something should come up with this sort of new idea that can

381
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
I think the Baby Boomers are still the key I think if they pull their Collective brainpower they can get us yet another economic

382
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,287
Just one more I believe I've one more is all we're asking

383
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
This is part of the problem

384
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
The time we have grown up in has let us to believe

385
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
High growth

386
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,503
Is easy that it is the status quo

387
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
We take it apart it is really been a bunch of sort of Lucky One Time brakes I mean there is not going to be another

388
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Baby boom

389
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
And you only get one shot at certain

390
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
Desktop computer

391
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Revolution

392
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
From here on out

393
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
It's going to be a slow grind ticket

394
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,679
But what if you did like a little bit of all the

395
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,775
What if you had a little immigration reform some better Education and Training

396
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
What about that

397
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
Yeah what about that

398
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,127
We're going to park to the math after the break

399
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,479

403
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:08,447
Mark gold wine has been doing the math for us and I asked him okay if we got a little bit of everything we talked about

404
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,263
About immigration reform maybe something to

405
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,103
To boost productivity some of those retirement changes we talked about

406
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,175
What do you think the American economy

407
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Can grow out what you hope

408
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,271
Michael number one is let's get to the right side of

409
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
And then I go number two is

410
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,671
Let's try to get into our way up to

411
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
3% I think if we

412
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,279
If we get serious and immigration I do think two and a half percent achievable

413
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Just because

414
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Immigration card

415
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
It's almost cheating because immigration just brings you more

416
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
Right that's that's a lot easier than these other things

417
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
Play easier

418
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
To bring in more people than two

419
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
Encourage people

420
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,615
On their own volition to work longer or to work more hours

421
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
As we said at the beginning

422
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,455
Donald Trump probably isn't

423
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
Going to like

424
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,783
But you know we have set out

425
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:00,671
The big dream it's sort of like how you know John F Kennedy challenged America to put a man on the moon

426
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,231
Trump quote if you wanted to challenge us to

427
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Transform

428
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Our society

429
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,327
To accomplish 3%

430
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
I mean picture

431
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:14,239
Gray haired Baby Boomers still working late into their 70s right alongside

432
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:20,895
40 million new immigrants driving on New Roads over new Bridges to new factories not driving being driven

433
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
Buy autonomous vehicles

434
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,295
Yes giving us time to put on a Virtual Reality helmets where we could take online courses

435
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,599
It would allow us to be more productive at our jobs

436
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,695
3D printing they always throw 3D printing it always

437
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
To paraphrase a president

438
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
That got us by the way to

439
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
6% growth

440
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,655
Now we are going to Q Roberts really terrible John F Kennedy impression

441
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
We choose to fight

442
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
What's 3% growth

443
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
And all these new technologies

444
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,359
Not because they are easy

445
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,879
Because

446
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Phone

447
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
And the other two

448
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
Mark gold wine the senior policy director of the committee for a responsible federal budget for coming in and doing the math

449
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:29,503
We would love to hear from you even through old Technologies like email Planet Money at npr.org or letter

450
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,111
Or letter Coast Guard newfangled technology like Twitter and Facebook are also welcome

451
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:41,023
By the way Robert and I are going to be performing at a live show the Saturday June 10th in Brooklyn in Brooklyn Park

There is another way another one another one

457
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
My daughter was on a rant by DJ Khaled

458
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
DJ Khaled

459
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Do anything

460
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,399
Brings people together

461
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,103
All I do is win win win no matter what

462
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,175
Got money on my mind I can never get enough

463
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,783
Everytime I walk into the building everybody's hands go up
