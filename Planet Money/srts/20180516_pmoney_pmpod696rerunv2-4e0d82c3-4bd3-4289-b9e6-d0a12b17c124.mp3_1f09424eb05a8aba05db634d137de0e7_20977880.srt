1
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:06,144
How's it going where NPR reporters were doing a story on pepper you got a second

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,680
Yeah it's okay

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:10,240
How's it going where NPR reporters were doing a story

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,056
Rapper

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,384
You and I were out on the streets of Manhattan

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,688
We're talking to people who are walking by

7
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,248
And we've got with us two tins of

8
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
Did the pepper that you've seen all your life to standard pepper 10

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
We got two of them

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
Because about a year ago

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
McCormick machine

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,768
This classic

13
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,560
Pepper chicken that they sell in the grocery

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,096
So what we were doing is

15
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,888
We have the old one and we have been

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,240
We asked people to play to play game we asked him to Spot the Difference

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
Between the old and the new

18
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,848
Same color red and white primarily

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,640
Little blue and McCormick

20
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,456
It appears that the embassy are the same

21
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,272
Your ground black pepper

22
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320
So that's what it say on the new one

23
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,392
Pure ground black pepper okay same font

24
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,720
It appears so it's an illusion

25
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
Not an illusion

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,512
Fin Fun

27
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
Other people

28
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
The tunes were slightly different size

29
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,400
Probably Merrill all right so you think it's a little bit thicker

30
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,984
Nine everywhere not thicker they are exactly the same size

31
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
The only difference between the tens is written right at the bottom of the small numbers that say how much pepper is in the

32
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
Different

33
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
Different amount

34
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
Different amount

35
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,320
The old tin the One McCormick sold for years and years has

36
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
4 oz of pepper in it

37
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
The new one has three

38
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
Significantly less

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,304
Same size canvas significantly less or quarter less

40
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
Impressive right the how identical they are like everything else I think that's a little rip off a little

41
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
Misleading now

42
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,128
The tens used to be filled with pepper all the way to the top now there's some empty space right there where there used to be pepper

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
And what is west of it

44
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
Are

45
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,224
Are

46
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
Why that

47
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,368
Who's going to take care of this meme

48
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,696
Do other countries what would happen here is some government Aid

49
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
MC Lyte say the FDA

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,144
Find the company or make them change what they're doing or maybe not I mean it does say right there on the front of it

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,728
Exactly how much pepper is inside they're telling the truth

52
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,544
In America we do not leave this up to the government

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,128
In America this whole pepper thing is the basis of a lawsuit

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Actually lots of lawsuit

55
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:30,016
It's in California and Iowa and Pennsylvania in about a dozen states in all

56
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
What are going to spend countless hours on

57
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,904
Arguing for the judges if it gets that far in front of juries

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Back and forth over this question of whether McCormick

59
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
Should have put more pepper

60
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
In the tent

61
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,120
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob.

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,936
The pepper case is a class action

63
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,776
Thousands of these lawsuits grind their way through the court system every year

64
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,336
Today on the show we meet the man who helped

65
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,152
Create this class-action world we live in today

66
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,480
You did it partly in the backseat of a car on a manual typewriter

67
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,552
We asked him how he feels about this thing that he Unleashed

68
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,880
Also we do try to get to the bottom of the pepper

69
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,696
By the way we originally reported the show back in

70
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
In 26

71
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
We'll have a little update at the

72
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,608

00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,816
Create the modern class action

82
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
His name is Arthur Miller

83
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
Not Arthur Miller the playwright Arthur Miller the lawyer

84
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,496
And he says the key work your happened in the 1960

85
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,824
I must check out I may be the last person alive

86
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
Who is in that room

87
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,432
Well I'm glad I'm glad we got you today then

88
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
Tomorrow who knows

89
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,272
Miller is a professor at NYU

90
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
He looks like my grandpa

91
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
They both have these amazing out of control eyebrow

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
But Miller is better dress

93
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
I have never thought

94
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
A class

95
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
Other than

96
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
In

97
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
A suit

98
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
The three piece suit

99
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,375
They don't really even make threesome

100
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
Piece suits any lawn

101
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
I wear them with a red tie

102
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
And a red pocket

103
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
That's a uniform

104
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
We went and visited Miller at his office

105
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,919
On spring break and there was nobody in the building but he was wearing that three piece suit

106
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,991
Class actions were not always about things like

107
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
Is there an app pepper in the

108
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,831
The roots of the modern class action

109
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
I'm going to say they were Noble

110
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,439
They go back to the Civil Rights Movement go back to this time when you had

111
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,791
Huge groups of people who are just being denied their basic legal right

112
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
A class-action is

113
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
When

114
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
You have a lot of pee

115
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,983
You can all fit into the courtroom

116
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
But you want to give them access

117
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
So 1 to 5

118
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,943
10 people come forward

119
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,015
And say we will sue on behalf of

120
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
Class actions have been around forever

121
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
But they weren't being used very much

122
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,671
That is really interesting reason

123
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
Yet the reason was a problem

124
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
With the rule

125
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
And I haven't really thought about the

126
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
Before but you know there's like these tutorial perilous

127
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,703
There's the laws that you think of the laws that congress

128
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,543
But then there's this other thing that is really important

129
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
And that is

130
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
The rules

131
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
For what happens in the courtroom

132
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
The rules for

133
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,479
Who can bring a case and when and what the judge can and can't do

134
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
They're called the federal rules of procedure

135
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,087
Nurses in the 60s

136
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
The rule for federal class actions was this

137
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
Total mess

138
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
You couldn't figure out what it was saying

139
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
The words were

140
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
We're short of an

141
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,607
Ambiguous they were vague they were amorphous

142
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,935
Hope Miller is working with this secret committee

143
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
And by secret I mean it's not at all

144
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,103
I just personally never heard of it before the Committees appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court

145
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
And their job was to

146
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
Update the rules

147
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,783
Specifically they were trying to change the rule for class action suit to make them more effective

148
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Giving key

149
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
In particular

150
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,135
What they want to do is they want to make it clear

151
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
That if even just one person

152
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,487
Send files a class-action and wins

153
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,327
The Judgment applies to everyone who is in the same situation

154
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
Everyone who could have filed

155
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,447
When weekend Miller and a senior lawyer

156
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,543
The driving out to the country trying to figure out exactly how to fix this rule

157
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
I'm in the backseat

158
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,967
With a typewriter you would consider to be something out of the Stone Age

159
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,807
It's like on your lap on my lap on my lap

160
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
In the backseat

161
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
And we're playing with words

162
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,975
So they're looking at the rule and they're trying to figure out how to make it right

163
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
They're saying put this word over here or put the semicolon over there

164
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,399
Yeah and then they drive their car onto a ferry they're going out to an island

165
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
For the weekend

166
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
On the ferry with all these other

167
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
Miller still sitting there in the backseat

168
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,823
Clacking away on this on this manual type

169
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,639
A woman in the car next to us

170
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
Rolls down her window

171
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
Reaches out and Taps are window

172
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
And the woman says

173
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,135
Don't you hear the clock she said

174
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
Are we sinking

175
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,511
How do you say civil rights

176
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Will change your life

177
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,935
He was right this rule was you it made it so anyone could go to court

178
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,007
Argue that their civil rights were violated and if they won

179
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,103
You change things for everybody who was in there you know in there same situation

180
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,687
Certainly every voter rights case you can think of

181
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,503
Came after this rule came in

182
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Natchez voting rights

183
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,343
Dozens and dozens and dozens

184
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
Of community

185
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Would be separate

186
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,463
Bigcommerce of the class action

187
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:03,327
You even see desegregation decisions in my old town of Boston

188
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
Where they desegregated

189
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
The school system

190
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
That was because of a class-action

191
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
That was the beginning of modern classic

192
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,383
But that for while some lawyers looked at this and said

193
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
You know we can file all all kinds of classes

194
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
What about those late fees on my cable bill

195
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
Yeah that was one of the first big one

196
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,135
Deborah Hensler is a political scientist at Stanford and she says

197
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
In that case

198
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,695
The plaintiffs won a big settlement

199
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,559
So I don't lawyers thinking fees monthly fees weight fees

200
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Who else

201
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
You know

202
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
What other businesses are there

203
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:45,311
Where this might be an issue and so you then see a line of cases why

204
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Like that

205
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,663
And here is where something that begin with big civil rights issue

206
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Voting

207
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
Desegregation

208
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
What are the gender discrimination

209
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,575
Cures word Edge toward things like

210
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
Can you be more pepper in this

211
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Enes Kanter pepper

212
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,719
Arthur Miller the guy who helped make all this happen

213
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
He was watching at the number of class actions exploded when do you realize the genie is a

214
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,167
Man created a monster

215
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,727
You can hear this voices by half

216
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
That they're a bad class actions of course there are bad

217
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Class Act

218
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,199
Do you remember the first one that you like this is just silly

219
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Yes

220
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Two of them

221
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Both happened in the 90

222
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
Okay sound honestly

223
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
When we born

224
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
I was born in 1989

225
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:37,279
Okay I'm going to be your 90s guy the first case Miller says you can describe into words

226
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
Milli Vanilli

227
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:44,191
Remember notionally honestly I barely remember

228
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Here's what happened

229
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
They were two singers

230
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
They had this big debut album it was a hit

231
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
I think it was this song what was it

232
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
Girl you know it's

233
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,735
True

234
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Yeah

235
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
I'mma tell you something

236
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
Not Milli Vanilli

237
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,743
What day was this candle day wear lip syncing came out they didn't actually sing on the album

238
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,071
And you know what comes next class action Class Act

239
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Settlement

240
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,655
People who bought the CD got $3 back

241
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Peabody Gazette

242
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
You got $2 back

243
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Amazing

244
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:23,359
He was later there was another case that made Noah crazy and this time he got to see it unfold in real-time

245
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Miller was watching this boxing match

246
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
On Pay-per-view

247
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Even I've heard of

248
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
Mike Tyson versus

249
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
Evander Holyfield

250
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
And lo and behold

251
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:36,927
The third round

252
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
Bites off a piece

253
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
Atole fields

254
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,095
Here

255
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,239
They stopped the fight Tysons disqualified and right away Miller picks up the phone and calls A friend is who is also a lawyer

256
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
I see Mel you watching the fight

257
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
He says yeah I said

258
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,103
Is class-action here

259
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,711
There's a Class Act this is a Consumer Fraud people have paid to watch

260
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
$90 whatever it was

261
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
This is a classic

262
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
The two of us were laughing

263
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
The following morning three class actions

264
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Defiled

265
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,071
And what were you thinking right then when you saw it in the newspaper

266
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
What did we create

267
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
I mean wide

268
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,703
People push the envelope

269
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
Beyond

270
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
Rationality

271
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,847
This this release oils at 4 everyday

272
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,663
I mean did you feel embarrassed

273
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Slightly

274
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
Embarrassed for the profession

275
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Come on

276
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Come on

277
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
You paid you saw

278
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
There's certain things in life

279
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
You should just

280
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Forget about

281
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
That's kind of what the judge said I got thrown out of court

282
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
So now we're to do that now we're to the world of Class Act

283
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Actors that we live in

284
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,167
And you can kind of way this you know on the one hand

285
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
Now you have the solution

286
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
If there are a lot of

287
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
Weapon harm and some really small way

288
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,615
That would never be worth bringing a lawsuit on it

289
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
Now classics

290
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,711
They can band together and fight back

291
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Amelia

292
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Come

293
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,599
I mean like when we've been talking to her friends about the

294
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
The story that were doing

295
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
Weather keeps saying to us is like yeah

296
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
Of course class action

297
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,023
I got a check for 2 bucks and the lawyers get rich

298
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
And you know you do have lots of lawyers and federal judges dealing with these cases and warehouses full of vodka

299
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,007
I actually don't know are there still working my mind there still Warehouse

300
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,823
There was there was a lot of cost here

301
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,407
It's an expensive way to figure out how much pepper

302
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
Should be in the tent

303
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
You've been spending a lot of time with pepper lately

304
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,295
We have been spending a lot of time with pepper

305
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,879
Elizabeth Fagan is one of the lead lawyers for the plaintiff in the pepper

306
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,023
Like are you entering the tins into evidence you are

307
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
We're making sure they preserve them

308
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
Here's the story fake and tells about

309
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,727
She says McCormick started putting less pepper in it spins about a year ago

310
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
Just leaving empty space

311
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,847
This media because I'm Global markets the price of

312
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Raw pepper

313
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,687
Commodity pepper whatever you call it the price was going through the

314
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,015
McCormick wouldn't talk to us for the story we ask

315
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
But they have argued in court filings

316
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,159
Hey look we put the correct amount of pepper right there on the label it

317
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,743
It's right there on the front of the tin for everyone to see we're not

318
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Hiding anything

319
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,583
But fake and says they still broke the law

320
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
There's a law

321
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,959
That prohibits was called non-functional slack fill

322
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,567
Means making a large package but only feeling it with a small amount of Prada

323
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
They just I just wanted like

324
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,199
Delighted that phrase to say the phrase

325
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,759
Non-functional slack fill

326
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,831
Okay so non-functional I get that Slack

327
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
Phil what is slack fill

328
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
Slack fill is

329
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Are

330
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
It's the fortune of a package that I

331
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
A manufacturer fills with nothing but air

332
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,959
Side note there is such a thing as functional slack filled are that's in the package for

333
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
That is allowed

334
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:05,567
If there's an FDA regulation that actually lift

335
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
6

336
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,895
Pacific reasons why flag still might be okay

337
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:13,503
Like if the product settles during shipping I'm pretty sure I've seen that on the side of the cereal

338
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,807
Bauxite product may have settled during shipping

339
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
And yes figen says

340
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
There's the potato chip rock

341
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,463
If you need a certain amount of air in a package to protect the product

342
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
For example

343
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
Potato chips are to protect

344
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,607
Potato chips from getting crushed

345
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
That is functional slack fill

346
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Correct

347
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,495
Are because you don't want to put as much pepper in the can

348
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Is not okay

349
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,639
Before Fagen was arguing about pepper in court she was handling other Class Act

350
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:47,039
Some of them had much higher Stakes one of those cases was over sexual harassment at a big real estate

351
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
Men were allowed to

352
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
View pornography

353
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,743
We're allowed to touch women in a way that women would not want to be touched in the workplace

354
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,559
You know it was a it was a very

355
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
Pratt house type environment

356
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
Company settled the case

357
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
Agreed to changes practices

358
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
Thousands of women

359
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Thousands of dollars

360
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Each

361
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,823
I don't know I don't know what kind what to ask

362
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:16,479
I get why you want the way the pepper in the 10 things me and doesn't seem that

363
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
It seems

364
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Kind of silly

365
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
On a certain

366
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,903
Certainly relative to to this case where

367
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,463
Women were being systemically harassed at this rate

368
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
And maybe that's an unfair

369
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,375
Comparison but I don't know what what do you think just can you sort of put that together for me

370
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
I think if there are cases

371
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,007
The have more societal value than others

372
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
And there are cases with

373
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
Where people have more

374
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
Personal injuries

375
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
And others

376
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
I'm so there's a spectrum

377
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
Of cases that can be brought as class actions

378
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,111
But consumers have a right to recover

379
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
$4

380
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Do the math

381
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,231
She says if you bought one of these tins

382
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,559
According to her argument that company should give you you know a couple bucks

383
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,583
Which team small

384
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
But

385
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,167
Millions of people have bought these pepperton

386
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
And that adds up

387
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
A lot of money

388
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,775
There is an FDA regulation about

389
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,567
This is how we called the FDA

390
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
They have not acted on this

391
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,431
I'm thinking so that's sort of the point of class

392
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,015
They're like this backup for When government Regulators don't act

393
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,647
Now there is this big backlash against this wave of class at you hear it all the time

394
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
Time right like

395
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,463
So many cases clogging up the courts

396
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
And businesses have started including these

397
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,119
Clauses in contracts that make it harder for people to sue

398
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:42,239
Urban challenges in court several weeks of going all the way to the Supreme Court the results there have been mix

399
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
So Jacob

400
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
We brought all this up with demand response

401
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Arthur Miller

402
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
You got this long Arc now

403
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
50 years

404
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
If

405
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
I'll be the life of this rule you created

406
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
We're here where we are now how do you

407
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
How do you weigh

408
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
What you

409
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
Done

410
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,231
It's an impossible question

411
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
Because you were weighing

412
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
We're trying to

413
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,655
Things that are unquantifiable

414
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
That is a very clever answer

415
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,751
And true as far as it go

416
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
But you

417
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Let's have some fun

418
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
How do you feel about

419
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
How do you feel about

420
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
What class action

421
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,735
I believe that in the 50 years

422
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
We have had this

423
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Rule

424
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,391
That there are certain class actions that never should have been brought

425
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Admit

426
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,999
That we have burdened our judiciary

427
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Yes

428
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,095
But we've had a lot of good stuff done

429
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
We really

430
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Have

431
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Miller says

432
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
2030 years ago

433
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,775
Lawyers from around the world used up pointed the US end

434
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
And laugh and Marcus

435
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,103
OUC over everything

436
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,663
There's so many class actions clogging up your system

437
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
Today he says

438
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
That has changed a lot

439
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
Dozens of countries around the world

440
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Now have

441
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Their own

442
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Big Country

443
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
France

444
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Australia

445
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
Taiwan

446
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Brazil

447
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
They have all decided

448
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Like we have

449
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
They don't want to leave regulation to the regular

450
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
They want to backup

451
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
They want class action

452
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,807
We'll have a little update on the pepper case

453
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Right after the

454
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,183
This message comes from NPR sponsor Capital One

455
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,231
Capital One is reimagining banking

456
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:44,607
I offering accounts with no fees or minimums that can be open from anywhere in 5 minutes

457
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Capital One

458
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
What's in your wallet

459
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Capital One na

460
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Okay

461
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,055
We originally reported the story back in 2016

462
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
And this week

463
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,127
I called up Elizabeth Fagan

464
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,455
She remember is the lead lawyer in the paper case

465
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,271
And I want to know how things were going

466
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
So is it over everyone

467
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:11,231
We have not one we're waiting for the court to rule on a motion for class certification

468
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
To the side

469
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,791
Weather everyone who bought pepper

470
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
Burton's is a like

471
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Whether they can sue.

472
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
What else are you working on in the meantime

473
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,751
We have a case involving Broiler chicken

474
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:29,407
Nationwide class action involving an an antitrust violations are conspiracy where the

475
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,711
Pictures of our chicken got together to

476
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,295
Reduce the amount of chicken at our stores and raise prices

477
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,111
Planet Money listeners will know the story very well

478
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
StayWell

479
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:43,231
We just did a show about chicken that is sort of the backstory of bacon

480
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
It's episode 840

481
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
And you're working on something else right

482
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:55,263
We are we are representing former actresses and actresses are other people in the entertainment industry

483
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,639
Dragons Harvey Weinstein then it's a truly horrific story and what some of these

484
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,711
Women have gone through and how it's affected their careers

485
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
I'm in fact really just derailed

486
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,575
I'm aware very promising acting careers

487
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,111
It's truly awful

488
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
Best thank you for the update

489
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
