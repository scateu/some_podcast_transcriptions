Hi Karen Duffin here

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,760
Today we are replaying a classic episode that was

11
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,296
Originally reported back in

12
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,368
In 2013 about wine in New Jersey

13
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,256
And believe it or not a lot has been happening in the New Jersey wine industry since we first reported this

14
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,304
So we will have an update for you at

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
The end of the show

16
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
Really this week Zoe and I

17
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
Hit the road for a tour of wine country

18
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,240
We drove most of the day we got The Vineyards

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,520
Right around sunset

20
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,800
Our first stop was

21
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,080
The alma theater cellar

22
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,616
It was pretty gorgeous

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,712
If you walk here you'll see

24
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,040
The owner Luciano Texas passed

25
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,832
100 year old farmhouse

26
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,904
And we drop out rows of Old Vine

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,488
But here's something that I put in the ground in 1976

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,072
Foods that this old world charm about him

29
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
You both kind of looks

30
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
Sounds like Marlon Brando

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,704
Have to have a feel for the next 30 Years After

32
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,008
Your baby is this what you're saying

33
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,336
Well more or less and I am hopeless Romantics and I'm starving

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,408
Realistic about the whole scene there

35
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
Looks like one of those etchings

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,064
But you'll see on the front of an old bottle of French wine you know with the vineyard in The Farmhouse

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,856
We are not in French

38
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
We are not even on the west

39
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,464
Inside Lou pulls out one of his bottle

40
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
Bottles that this Winery

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,424
The location we're standing in is in something called the outer coastal plain

42
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
This is so good this is

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
Fantastic

44
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
So good

45
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
Easy to forget where we really are

46
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
You like that one

47
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,200
Not bad for New Jersey right

48
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
New Jersey

49
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,744

Tries to show the snob that he is just as good as they are

Lukrecja low and his fellow New Jersey wine makers

57
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
Suffer from the classic problem

58
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,528
You aren't always judged by who you really are

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
The by your reputation

60
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088

How do you get the haters

62
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:41,280

Store or go to madewell.com

83
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,616
The dream that New Jersey could be like

84
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,712
France ligue Bordeaux this is not crazy this is happened before

85
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
There was once

86
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,320
Another Scrappy Underdog estate that was reviled

87
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
The butt of jokes widely mocked horrible reputation

88
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,488
Their wine got no respect and fancy wine drinkers wouldn't touch

89
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,816
In 1976 the reputation of California

90
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
Wines was

91
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
That it was only slightly better than Rock.

92
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
That's George Tabor

93
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
He's a White journalist

94
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
There were sweet

95
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
High alcohol wine

96
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
Such as Ripple

97
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
When its slogan was it has that ring a ding flavor and this guy George Tabor it was on the scene when California

98
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
It's coming out party it's

99
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
Debutante ball

100
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
In the 1970s

101
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
Heber was a writer for Time magazine in Paris and

102
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,208
He got this weird little press release one day inviting him

103
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
To cover an event called

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
The Judgment of

105
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,583
Paris in honor of the American Bicentennial

106
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
California wines out of the little-known be

107
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,215
Regions of Napa and Sonoma would go head-to-head with

108
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
French Chardonnay and Cabernet

109
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
So paper shows up

110
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
May 24th

111
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
1970s

112
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
He's the only journalist in the room

113
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
Preeminent French wine expert

114
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
He looks around

115
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,575
If he can immediately see something happening

116
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
The judges were becoming

117
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Fused

118
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
They could not tell the difference

119
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,999
Between a California wine and French wine

120
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Well there was one

121
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
Kind of freakish moment

122
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,399
When Raymond Oliveira who was the Julia Child in France

123
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Set the time

124
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
And he had a glass of wine up

125
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
And he looked at it

126
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,591
And you swirl it around and he tasted and then he looked at it again he said

127
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Allied

128
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
Back to friends

129
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
I looked out my scorecard I was the only

130
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
One of the rumor had a scorecard so I knew what they were drinking

131
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,671
And he just tasted a freemark Abbey wine from California

132
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,815
Sacre bleu the winning line was American the French word humiliated California was triumphant

133
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
The Judgment of

134
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,887
Paris put California on the map

135
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Overnight

136
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
The next

137
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Monday morning

138
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
The Time Magazine story

139
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
Came out

140
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,103
I found a baby wine shopping

141
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
Manhattan

142
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
They were swamped

143
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,735
With people coming in with their copies of Time Magazine saying

144
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
Can you have any of these wines

145
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
If you do can I buy him

146
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
You probably know what happened next

147
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
The price for California wine what up

148
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
Number of wineries in Napa

149
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
And Sonoma

150
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:50,975
Exploded

151
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
A star was born

152
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
And all around the world

153
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
Dreamed of making great wine said

154
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
People like Luke rocheleau in New Jersey

155
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,007
If the French had been taken down by anybody that meant to the new

156
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
World was going to open

157
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,383
If that was possible that means any region in the world with similar

158
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
Carmen the winemakers could do that

159
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Even New Jersey

160
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
And solu Plantation

161
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
Is first vines in an old

162
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
Potato field that is family owned

163
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
Just off the Old Highway

164
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
Halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City

165
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,535
If 1976 was when the California wine industry arrived

166
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
The New Jersey fine wine industry was just

167
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Beginning

168
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,679
The thing about wine is that everything takes

169
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,727
A long long time

170
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
Okay so

171
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
You want to taste the wine

172
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
Lou takes us through his old farmhouse

173
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
The food science

174
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Best Buy training

175
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
And he did not cut any

176
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
Corners in his operation

177
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
It took him six years

178
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Dejected

179
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,599
Great grapes

180
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
Alone right

181
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,719
Retainers after that to produce a bottle that he was proud enough to share

182
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,999
And eventually

183
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Eventually the wind started

184
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Taste the way he imagined

185
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
It started to taste

186
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
French

187
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
Who opens the door to the White's house

188
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
So

189
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
This is this looks

190
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
Like

191
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
Basically a cliche of European

192
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
Wine cellar

193
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
Hippie 1682 here

194
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,991
Exactly is little candles around and he's beautiful

195
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
Barrels

196
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
Attacked another cliche

197
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,903
This is a guy identical to the way it was going to 1750 nothing's different

198
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,999
Making the wind is hard but that's the fun Romance

199
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
Louis got a way bigger challenge

200
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
Getting other people to notice

201
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
That is wine is great

202
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,215
And that's an especially Big Challenge in

203
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
New Jersey

204
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,567
Not just because of all the things you think of when you think of New Jersey but because

205
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
New Jersey wine

206
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
Already has made a name for its

207
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
It's just not the name that you want

208
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Where's New Jersey one

209
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,319
People have been making wine in New Jersey for 200 years

210
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
There are dozens of wineries

211
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
People like

212
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Charlie tomasello

213
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,975
He's just down the road from Lou but

214
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,535
He is Worlds Away in his winemaking

215
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
King Style

216
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
BT pellets

217
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
Do you like

218
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,495
It has been described to me as

219
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
A little bit like grape jelly

220
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,591
Yes well I think that's it

221
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
Because concrete is used by

222
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
Welch's probably make

223
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,991
Grape jelly center

224
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
And it's very sweet I had to

225
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Tell you that

226
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Sweet

227
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Smuckers

228
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,231
Concord grapes

229
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Lose fat

230
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
French style

231
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Why dump truck

232
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,119
But Charlie tomasello has been here way longer than Luke

233
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:42,239
Decorative migas traditional gravy wine it retails for about 10 bucks

234
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,311
His grandfather started the police after prohibition

235
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
History is it

236
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:53,247
A couple weeks after prohibition ended he ran to Washington in the snowstorm and got his license grandfather was pretty much

237
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
Not quite the first in line but almost the first one

238
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:00,159
Thomasville family have been very successful

239
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
Making me sweet wine

240
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
You can find them all over the country

241
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,279
And the tomasello winery and others

242
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
Bastille the world

243
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,119
What New Jersey style wine is

244
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
It's pretty

245
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
Sometimes it even made from raspberry

246
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Cranberry

247
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,055
Especially people always talk about the New Jersey blueberry wine

248
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
I like it

249
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,663
I know I can picture almost like being poured over ice cream

250
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,735
It has that kind of like almost syrupy taste to it

251
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
It goes very well with cheesecake

252
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,343
Nothing wrong with cheesecake why

253
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
This is a very good example of the form

254
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,463
Even at $11 a bottle Charlie

255
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,047
Eats it when people assume fruit wines are low quality

256
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
There are 12 lb of raspberries in a gallon of tomasello Raspberry wine so it's a premium raspberry

257
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,287
It's just not the kind of wine you can charge

258
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
$100 a bottle for

259
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
What kind of wine that

260
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
Wine collectors around the world will fight to own

261
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
And your friend is not the

262
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,343
What kind of wine inspires people to travel a long way to spend gobs of money you know taking bicycle tours to the

263
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
Wine Country

264
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
A southern New Jersey

265
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:08,511
Writing out the New Jersey wine industry generates around 35 million dollars

266
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Ciara

267
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,351
California wine is hundreds of times bigger

268
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,911
20 billion dollars a year

269
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,495
Lucre Chula and even some of the fruit winemaker's dreams

270
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
Stealing away some of that money

271
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
I think the Jersey land and the Jersey grapes are good enough

272
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,175
The problem is how to change people's expectations

273
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Lou wants

274
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
Esl classic

275
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
European style dry wine

276
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
From a place

277
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Where people

278
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Expect you

279
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
Now would be really clear for a second

280
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,695
I'm here I am not a sophisticated wine

281
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:43,327
I'm not either we both thought that both wines were delicious so sweet and the dry

282
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,679
But the point we're making here is that in order to sell the dry

283
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,799
You can't be saddled with the reputation that all the wines that come out of your area or sweet

284
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
George Tabor that wine journalist

285
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
We spoke to a book about the Judgment of

286
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,479
Serious wine buyers will not look

287
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Twice

288
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
Add a bottle with the name nude

289
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
Basically the wine industry

290
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Wine business in the state

291
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
He's got to kick that reputation

292
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
And you don't kick it

293
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,767
By continuing to have

294
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
80% of the wines out on the

295
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
The market

296
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
Are those sweet ones

297
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
You can buy

298
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,751
Tomasello blueberry wine in bulk

299
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Liquor store

300
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,359
It's out there their they're making it there

301
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
Obviously making a profit on it

302
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
They're just not making a reputation on

303
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,831
This is known as a collective action problem and it basically means this

304
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,927
Sometimes your success depends on how your competitors behave

305
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
People are judging you not

306
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
Just buy your product but

307
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,047
Buy the product that your rival down this

308
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Street mix

309
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
You are all groups

310
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
Together in their mouth

311
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
Louis caracciolo and his french-inspired wine

312
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
What's the change the reputation of newt

313
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,567
He wants to make it a place where you can go for cabernets and have frogs

314
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
But I can't do it alone

315
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,919
He needs his competitors to up their game 2

316
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
So that when someone takes their very first New Jersey wine

317
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
That experience

318
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
The thing they're going to form all their opinions on

319
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
That experience has to be good

320
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
Lowest taking this on this

321
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
Is collective action problems he has a plan

322
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
First thing

323
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
Ditch the name New Jersey

324
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Much better to

325
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,143
Slap on the official geological name for the area around Atlantic City

326
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
The outer coastal

327
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,751
The outer coastal plain when imin International

328
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Show now

329
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
People pick that up and say

330
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,407
That's almost really isn't it but once and Australia

331
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
New Jersey

332
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
It sounds fancy

333
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
It's Market

334
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,343
When you get to work outer coastal plain you can almost

335
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,951
I smell the Salt Air the breeze coming off the water you picture this

336
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
Rolling Hills

337
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
Yeah it needs a little bit like that in South Jersey

338
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
But the name is actually

339
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
Legit

340
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
Luann from the other winemaker

341
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,471
Cuz they got South Jersey officially certified by the federal government

342
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
As a wine region

343
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
An American

344
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Viticultural area

345
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Lake Sonoma

346
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
Like the Russian River Valley

347
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,711
Like the Antelope Valley of the California high desert

348
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
That's Los Angeles County

349
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,111
Just north of La okay what are you got this trick from the front

350
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
It's how they dealt with their Collective action problem

351
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Back in the 19th century

352
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,511
Back then some French wine was good

353
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Other French wine

354
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
When was laozi

355
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
The fancy winemaker

356
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,631
Force the government to come up with a

357
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
Formal classification system

358
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,007
The premier wineries band they didn't have to worry about what their neighbors were doing

359
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,031
How to destroy the reputation

360
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,823
Wine regions in the US

361
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Accomplish some of the same

362
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
Napa wines Pizza

363
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,711
Way in the Hope in New Jersey is

364
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,527
The outer coastal plain will acquire

365
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
Slowly the same sort of cachet

366
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,367
What's cheaper stuff

367
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Call itself New Jersey

368
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
But a name is not enough

369
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
You also need a

370
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Critical mass

371
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Of wineries

372
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
Who uses the classic jersey example

373
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,399
It's very very similar to gambling

374
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,215
You're not you're not a gambling region Leicester

375
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
10

376
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
Reno casinos

377
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,383
So here the jewelry for wine drinkers are going to come down the region to spend a day or two

378
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
They got to be able to take University

379
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,479
Of the different ones and then

380
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,527
That that Rising tide lifts All Ships

381
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
And so Lou is on a mission

382
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,415
He visits the other wineries in New Jersey and give them the sales pitch

383
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,999
Sherp still sell the sweet wine make your money that way

384
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Make your record

385
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,583
Keyshia Dior prestige on the phone

386
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
It's not the most

387
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
Easy pitch in the world

388
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
Making French

389
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
Or California style wine is in

390
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
Expensive proposition

391
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,079
Finicky grape vines that require constant

392
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,919
Pending and you can't release your wine right away you can't make your money back

393
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
Agent properly in Oak Barrel

394
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
B70

395
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
210 years before you can make

396
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
Any money selling the wine from those

397
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
New European Vines you plant

398
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,207
Some people are into it though Charlie Thomas Loc

399
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,255
He still makes the traditional New Jersey

400
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
Sweet wine

401
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
But he's also battling a

402
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,423
2010 Reserve Cabernet grape jelly

403
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
Fatheads

404
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Nice kisses

405
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
Forward fruit in a little bit of leather and chocolate

406
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
Even the cork sounds fancy

407
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
And it is delicious

408
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Called

409
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Cameras

410
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
It sells for

411
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,903
$48 a bottle in the name New Jersey does not appear on the front of the bottle

412
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
It's all out of

413
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,511
If you want to know the name of the winery or where it's from

414
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,279
You have to check

415
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
Define print on the back

416
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,143
Lou and Charlie tomasello and the other New Jersey wine makers

417
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
Still waiting for the big

418
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
California MoMA

419
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
But it's tougher than it was in 1970

420
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
Sex back then

421
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,103
They were not too many states that we're making great why

422
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,919
But lose try to recreate the magic of

423
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
That's hot

424
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,015
Last year flu and ends Neighbors in Southern New Jersey

425
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
They're going to have their own blind test

426
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,391
Just like the one that happened in Paris the Judgment of Paris

427
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
The distance knobs

428
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
Would have to pick up a jersey wines

429
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
From a field of French heavy

430
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,071
George Tabor the guy who was in Paris in 1976

431
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
He came to Princeton

432
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
And they try to replicate it

433
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Number 6

434
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
French Cabernet Sauvignon

435
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
In the competition

436
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
+ 4

437
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
From the United States

438
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
It's again just as it had been at Paris

439
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Show picture

440
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Quiet room

441
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
You're taking

442
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
I need little sips of wine

443
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
The experts have their pencils and their slips

444
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
The paper that writing everything down

445
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
The scores are being tallied

446
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,671
And then the moment

447
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,975
This was the time for New Jersey

448
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
To show the world what they were made of

449
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,095
And somewhere out on Highway 9

450
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
Springsteen holds his breath

451
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
And the winner among the whites

452
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Is

453
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
A French wine

454
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
French wine

455
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
But

456
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
The second place

457
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
Was a New Jersey one

458
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,175
The state of New Jersey the Garden State

459
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,503
That wine would be made at Exit 8

460
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,855
I got it Exit 8 on the turnpike

461
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
Overall New Jersey wines did

462
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Really well

463
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,279
Three of the top 4 white wines were from New Jersey

464
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
Garden State red

465
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
Place 3rd

466
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
Charlie tomasello Cabernet

467
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Took 5th Place

468
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,567
But so far no mad rush to the wine shops Looking for Jersey wine

469
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Quake of the

470
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
The judgement of Paris

471
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,199
You know if you listen if you put your ear to the ground

472
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
You can hear a rumble

473
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
Way out on the turnpike

474
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
Jersey is coming

475
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,447
Support for this podcast and the following message come from made

476

How did they make them so great

480
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Madewell

481
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
What starts with premium denim

482
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919

483
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
4 seriously every

484
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,783

485
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087

486
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
They work with the blue jeans go green

487
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Turn old jeans

488
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695

Karen Duffin again here in 2018 with a few updates

495
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,335
So I checked back in with Lou house wine in New Jersey

496
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
How about your business

497
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
Wow

498
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:35,391
Sale of New Jersey wine is up almost 38% since 2011 they now have four official

499
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
Billy designated wine growing regions

500
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:42,559
I'm also told people have gone from there's no way New Jersey has good wine to

501
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,375
I'm curious about how New Jersey wine taste

502
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:50,751
And they're about to get a little more help in selling people on New Jersey wine

503
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:57,407
The Garden State wine growers association just got a grant from the USDA to do a marketing campaign for

504
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
New Jersey wine

505
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
I have some ideas

506
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
Trying to hear my slogan ideas

507
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
Okay how about

508
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,879
Stop being a snob drink New Jersey wine

509
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
Work

510
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
Blue like the snot

511
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,535
Because if you can convert

512
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
Stop going around

513
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
Just found a winery that's the whole goal of being a snob is that you catch the thing before it becomes a thing

514
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,039
I see well I guess we don't need my second slogan idea then

515
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Okay here we go

516
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,671
If it's good enough for Bon Jovi it's good enough for you

517
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,975
I am told it well

518
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,535
Bon Jovi is invested in wineries

519
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,095
He's not invested in New Jersey Winery

520
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
Blue says he can fix that

521
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:58,079
Okay alright so next step broker an introduction to Bon Jovi

522
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:05,247
