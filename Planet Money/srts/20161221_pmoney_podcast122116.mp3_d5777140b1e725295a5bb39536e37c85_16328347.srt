1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,560
So just I don't know if you happen to see

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,584
See this video

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:06,656
It is of Theresa May the prime minister of the UK

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,240
UK and she's at a European Union council meeting in Brussels

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,264
Which type are you

6
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,592
Oh she's all alone

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
So you see all these European delegates talking and hugging in the fancy conference room and Theresa May is just standing in the middle of

8
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
Everything

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,552
Totally alone

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,088
Bomber jacket

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,136
No one will talk to her

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
It's brexit Chima

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,720
She's getting stubs because of brexit

14
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,792
And it looks almost exactly like my junior high lunch room

15
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,936
Does awkwardness might continue

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
It looks like 2017

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,288
Might be the year the European Union

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
Starts to break up

19
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:49,920
When the UK begins this two-year process of decoupling from the Union

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,248
Is there actually using the eu's own constitutional rules

21
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
Allah called article V

22
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
It's an exit clause

23
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,904
It says if any country wants to leave this new Union

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
It can't

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,232
It was a late addition to EU laws and it was

26
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,120
Controversial is it a good idea to have a prenup built into the laws of your brand new Union

27
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,216
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jessica and I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

28
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
The exit clause

29
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:19,104
European Union has one United States of America does not

30
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
Spanish o we consider the exit clause

31
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
After all there has been this wave of protectionism kind of sweeping the globe and soon we could all be

32
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,232
These lonely Teresa maze at the EU council meeting

33

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,704
The roots of the European Union go back to the 19th

42
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,288
Europe has gone through two terrible world wars

43
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
And the EU was the symbol of a new era

44
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
Peace and free trade

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
All of these countries coming to

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
Chemical element with one of the architects of that

47
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
He's from Finland a longtime Member of Parliament

48
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
And the EU is like his life's work

49
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
You are founding father

50
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,720
Beaver County Father's Day

51
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,584
Felt so strongly that now we are creating United States of Europe now

52
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,912
Chemo spent years in small conference room

53
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Hammering out tree

54
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,728
Read he's trying to make this Union

55
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:55,872
And it was incredibly hard it meant juggling the interest of dozens of countries try to overcome

56
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,176
Cultural differences and language barriers

57
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,760
Even something as simple as cracking a joke with a nightmare

58
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
It had to be filtered

59
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
Dozens of translators into more than 20 languages

60
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
If I make a joke

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,512
The first people to live out the finished delegate and estonians who understand Finnish

62
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,864
Let's say 15 seconds or 10 seconds later on start to BB cloth

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,960
When that man with those who are listening to English translator

64
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Alafia

65
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
I've been gone 10 seconds more 15 seconds more often than they have been translated from

66
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,944
English to the national language

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
Chemo and the other European delegates

68
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
Went through this process for every

69
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,624
Every you lie every little decision

70
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
We asked him what to tell us of finish

71
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,280
Mika on Bitterroot this down here

72
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
And in English

73
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,656
If it's a joke says that while these are common with the mouse and elephant

74
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,960
What is common Mouse and elephant

75
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
Daniel screwdriver

76
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
Not true

77
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,456
That's absolutely true

78
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
Can you know if we got

79
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
I still don't get it

80
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,232
All the differences in language barriers, says the EU have this goal

81
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
This idea

82
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
They wanted to create a union

83
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
That looks a lot like the United States

84
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
It's flattering to think that the Europeans wanted

85
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
To be more like us

86
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
But actually

87
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
Hold your roll

88
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,895
It's more that the EU we're up against the same challenges that the u.s. Founding Fathers rap again

89
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
Almost like in Philadelphia Convention of course the President says his cholesterol supposed to be George Washington

90
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
Who are you who are you I was one of the members of the collection

91
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,607
I'm coming from small country Finland you must understand convention so we must

92
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
Be humble

93
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:59,263
At the time the US Constitution was written 13 colonies the different states were all basically operating like

94
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,031
Little country

95
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,127
Fight with each other over land New York New Hampshire

96
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Dover Vermont

97
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,247
Anyone even Tech stuff coming in from other states they actually imposed

98
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Tariffs against

99
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
And the cultures were really different

100
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,415
Pennsylvania was mostly Quakers Maryland was almost all Catholics

101
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
Georgia was still really wild

102
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
Even language

103
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,351
Accents for really strong in the different colonies in Austin people from one state

104
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,911
Could not understand what people from another state

105
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
We're saying

106
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,031
We actually got our hands on some early recordings from the US that showed

107
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,359
Case the different accents of deserve more than a hundred years old so the

108
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
Recording quality is real

109
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:43,039
Really bad but if you listen really carefully you can hear how strong the accents are at the First Recording is a man from Massachusetts

110
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
And it's hard to hear him but he is talking about being a soldier and getting ammunition and being out in the cold

111
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
See if you can understand recess

112
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,607
Norwegian region

113
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
I have no idea what you just said

114
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:05,823
And there's another recording this is a woman from Virginia and she's talking about

115
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,639
Donuts vs. crawlers I think

116
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
Call

117
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
Could you make crab cakes

118
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
It was also hard for people from one state to do business with

119
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
State is each state had its own

120
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Currency

121
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
Sterling in Rhode Island

122
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
Handmade certificate

123
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
David a Stewart is the author of The Summer of

124
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
1780

125
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,775
He said a lot of times you couldn't use currency from one state

126
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
In another state

127
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
If you traveled

128
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,871
You could stop it and then and

129
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
Offering them

130
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
Pennsylvania pound sterling in the guy says no I don't take those

131
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Or

132
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,343
He might have said while I'll take him but I'll only get a 40% discount

133
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
This is what the founders were up again

134
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
When they were trying to create the United States

135
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
They did have a loose central government

136
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
But nobody took it seriously

137
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,119
A lot of the states wouldn't bother showing up to the meeting

138
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
And this little Union couldn't get anything done

139
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,751
It couldn't even manage to get a federal tax

140
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,591
In order to approve a tax you needed a unanimous vote

141
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
But they never got it yunnan

142
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
Because there's always somebody does

143
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Swan taxes

144
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
No money

145
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,575
But I had no money they would date ask the states

146
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
To give them up

147
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,647
That just sort of for donations

148
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,231
Public radio public radio fundraising

149
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
It was it was although the entertainment wasn't as good

150
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
Maybe they should have tried giving out death

151
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
You cannot go wrong with a tote bag

152
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:40,031
David said there was so much infighting among the states that George Washington said the states world

153
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
Pulling against each other

154
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
And it would quote

155
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Soon bring ruin to the whole

156
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,455
But a lot of people thought that would be okay

157
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,271
Remember they had just fought a war against the British

158
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,855
The idea of creating a strong central government was frightening

159
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,183
But statesmanlike Alexander Hamilton and James Madison.

160
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,815
The only way for the country to survive and be a real presence in the world was to unify

161
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,375
So they said a meeting for all the state delegates

162
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
In 1787

163
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
Write a Constitution of the United States

164
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
We now know this as the Philadelphia

165
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
And it took place in Independence Hall

166
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
Which at that time was the State House

167
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
They

168
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
The whole summer with

169
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
Basically with each other

170
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
6 days a week

171
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
They were in that room

172
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
Every kind of smells guide

173
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,695
No weld you touch on us

174
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
Important point

175
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,791
They thought it was very important that they meet in secret

176
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
No one know what they were

177
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Arguing about

178
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,935
Cuz I thought it would undermine their credibility when they finally reached it

179
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,775
They closed the doors and keep the windows shut

180
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
Which in July in Philadelphia

181
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Is Kylie hot

182
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
The smaller states were worried that their voices were

183
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
Booty lost in this new year

184
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
The larger states did not want to give up

185
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
CorePower Zuni and there was a compromise

186
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,879
That is how we ended up with the two different houses

187
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Congress

188
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,207
And the Electoral College was also part of this comp

189
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
It keeps smaller States a bigger voice in

190
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
In the presidential

191
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
And 200 years later

192
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,935
Europe is talking about the same things when the EU was forming

193
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,799
Chemical human are European Founding Father debated these kinds of issues

194
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Flying back and forth

195
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
From Finland to Brussels

196
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
Tackling issue after issue for

197
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
4 years

198
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,503
You should live a very very very intensive the days

199
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Very long days

200
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
Everything was up for debate and

201
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
Everything was a battle

202
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
What should the European Anthem be what

203
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Flag look like

204
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
Should we have an army should be

205
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
We have a central bank

206
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,559
What should we put on the Euro the new currency we have

207
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
That one was a huge fight

208
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
Irwin Stelzer a columnist in

209
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Economist

210
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
Told us all about it

211
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
There is no

212
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Any

213
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,591
Image on any of the paper identifiable with any country

214
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
So what did they put on there

215
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,687
Well you know if you have a couple of

216
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,015
What look like buildings you have

217
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,807
Couple of birds

218
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647
I understand this was a huge

219
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,695
Huge brawl

220
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,279
Over each image on the euro currency

221
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,863
There was also a huge fight over where the parliament should be

222
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,727
I couldn't settle on anyone please so the EU Parliament sits for part of the year in Brussels

223
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
And part of the year in straws

224
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,823
Which is a city in France right on the border

225
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
Germany

226
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,919
And they move the entire Parliament Lock Stock & Barrel

227
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
And even after all of those debates on

228
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
On all of those issues

229
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
A lot of countries were still

230
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,879
And so in the last treaty that made up that use constitute

231
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
National laws

232
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
The added article

233
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
An exit

234
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,351
Okay so if you kind of think about the European Union as a kind of marriage of all these

235
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Countries

236
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,191
Then having this excerpt causes almost like having

237
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
A prenup right there

238
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,311
Having divorce option

239
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
You everywhere

240
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,503
We are not Catholic in the way that he said you must be my new married once you up today live

241
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,319
We are Protestant more so if you have the D

242
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
Divorce options

243
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,951
Chemosis article 50 was really essential in creating this new Union

244
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
He says when delegates from other countries

245
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,071
Come to him worried that the EU was going to look like the US with

246
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
Really strong centralized government

247
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,167
Where their country would lose its identity

248
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,519
No no no that's that's not us this is not that us

249
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
We have an exit clause

250
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
You can leave anytime you want

251
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
You always saying that the upgrade United States of Europe

252
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Nobody ever created

253
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
Station exit closed

254
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,015
You see it there's an exit clause

255
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
You see it

256
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,111
And Camo says there were a lot of skeptical country

257
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,719
The UK was a big one they never adopted the Euro never put a ring on it

258
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Nope

259
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:48,095
It was a very different situation from what happened in this country at the Philadelphia

260
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,935
Our Union was created to be a different kind of you

261
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,775
And it's evident from the very first line in our constitution

262
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
Does US historian David Oster

263
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Archives

264
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
Institution. Start out saying We the People

265
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
David says

266
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,479
We the People meant the union answered to the

267
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
The people not the states

268
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
Patrick Henry want to get close to Constitution

269
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Actually

270
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
Is first speech started out

271
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,255
How dare they say we the people in the opening of The Constitution

272
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
That's an outrage

273
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
It should say we the states

274
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,935
The eu's Constitutional documents do not start out with weave

275
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
NCC

276
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
Here it is

277
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
His majesty the king of the belgians

278
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
The president of the Czech

279
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Republic

280
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Her Majesty the

281
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Denmark

282
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
The president the Federal

283
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
Germany the president of

284
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,575
The federal public westonia the president of the Hellenic Republic

285
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,415
His majesty the king of Spain and it just goes on like that for a peach

286
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,999
Basically listing out all the leaders of all the countries

287
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,815
The existence of an exit clause comes down to

288
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
To where the final power lies

289
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,679
With the union or with the individual parts

290
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,471
Europe chose individual parts

291
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Weetos the Union

292
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
We have no exit

293
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,847
And we paid a big price for that

294
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,199
When a group of 11 Southern States tried to secede from the Union in 1860

295
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
Abraham Lincoln said

296
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
You can't do that

297
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,575
President Lincoln very much had the view

298
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
What you articulated

299
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
That the

300
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
Union was indissoluble

301
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,071
That no state could leave the union and that no state actually did leave the union

302
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,119
But even those Southern States

303
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
What they do

304
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,703
They've been terribly mistake

305
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
So

306
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
It

307
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Is

308
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
At some level of

309
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
Almost metaphysical

310
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
Dirty theoretical questions

311
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,759
70 years after the United States was founded

312
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
It fought a civil

313
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
And chemo kill human are delegate from Finland

314
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Does the European Union

315
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
Took a lesson

316
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Finesse

317
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
Make the union volunteer

318
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
If a country really wants to leave

319
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
It should have that right

320
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
To be honest

321
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:01,727
I never would imagine that any country of America state of Europe a unit live with you

322
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
Then the financial crisis happen

323
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
They were bank bailouts austerity measure

324
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
A Syrian refugee crisis

325
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
NAU case

326
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,967
This Union isn't working for us anymore

327
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,527
Chemo says when he heard the news about brexit

328
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Was devastated

329
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
He didn't even believe it at first

330
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
Still he says

331
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,415
He does see it as Prague

332
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Listen to war

333
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,511
Usually this type of

334
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Fundamental

335
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,839
Brakes

336
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
Results of War

337
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,703
Kitchen might leave European Union without War

338
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,727
That's a positive

339
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,311
Camo says if you have to do it all over again

340
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
He would still put in article V

341
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
So you don't regret article

342
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Something new

343
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
I don't regret

344
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,319
But this civilized exit might spell the end of the EU

345
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
And that's where we are now

346
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,463
Next year Theresa May the prime minister of the UK is expected to trigger artic

347
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,047
Britain and the EU will start hammering out the terms of

348
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,607
Irwin Stelzer The Economist

349
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
Says if this happens

350
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
The EU is going to need to make this

351
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,007
Hurt as a signal to other Restless countries who might

352
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
The exit

353
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,847
That leaving this Union is a bad idea

354
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,223
The EU has to try to include a punishment Factor

355
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,343
In the negotiation something that makes it clear to other countries

356
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
That Britain is paying through the nose

357
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
Before leaving

358
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,231
That's going to make litigation very very

359
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,047
Who needs to be like article 50 with a bullet

360
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Well

361
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
You you have strong a words that night

362
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:45,151
Bullet is what we did here in the US and Europe leaving the union looks more like a woman standing alone in the middle

363
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,551
Of a crowded room while everyone talks and shakes hands and laughs in the background

364
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
We always like to hear what you think sent us an email Planet Money at M

365

366
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
We would also like to thank Harvey Todd from the Library of Congress for those early American recording

367
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:23,551
Podcast pop culture happy hour they have a Roundup of all the best podcast from 2016 Soca
