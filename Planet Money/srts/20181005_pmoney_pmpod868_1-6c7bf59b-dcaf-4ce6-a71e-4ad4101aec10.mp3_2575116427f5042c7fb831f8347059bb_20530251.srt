Publishers of people power and profit

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,216
Progressive capitalism or an age of discontent

5
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,264
By Nobel prize-winning economist

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,544
Joseph E stiglitz

7
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,872
Oliver below is a journalist

8
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,664
To write a lot about financial

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,432
Talk rhyme

10
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,736
How many years he worked in Eastern Europe

11
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,552
And in 2014 he was in Ukraine

12
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,344
And Ukraine was in bad shape

13
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,880
Ukraine music

14
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Pomsky

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,232
You know it was in a mess of the roads were falling apart though

16
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,560
The government was terribly got to pay bribes to get anything done that

17
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,888
Children can get the medicines they needed and it was awful

18
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,936
It was awful but it was also interest

19
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,800
Oliver is fascinated by the countries that make up the former Soviet Union

20
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,824
Like Ukraine

21
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:50,944
Since the end of the Cold War Ukraine is always sort of had one foot in Europe and one foot in Russia

22
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,344
And then in 2013/2014 Ukraine's president a man named Viktor Yanukovych

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
Decided to move

24
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
Both feet

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
Toward Russia

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,000
His government suspended a plan to sign this

27
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,048
Trade deal with the European Union

28
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,656
Which would ideally have brought open markets and transparency he said no

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
We want more trade with Russia

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
And it's

31
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Oligarchs

32
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Incorruption

33
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,824
This is a small group of intellectuals

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
Will Furious

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
The other night and they wanted

36
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,664
Protested

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,528
The princess continued and then the government responded in very heavy-handed way

38
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,880
Tomorrow People cast

39
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,440
This expression of Rage

40
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,024
The presence of just have to run away

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,096
Paisley deep timor-leste went away and the clothes he was wearing

42
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
He did bring his hand luggage

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,984
But when Yanukovych got on his helicopter and bounced to Russia

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,616
Everyone including Oliver was able to get this rear window into how he been living

45
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,968
Because it's houses were just left open left there for anyone to see

46
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,552
So Oliver go see Anna Kovach is Palace on the outskirts of

47
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,368
Kiev I woke up to this fences it's an ordinary

48
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,184
Green fence right to green fence but

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
It could be around 2 I mean it simple dump or something

50
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
And I won't screw this

51
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
Gateway pics my card into the

52
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
A Wonderland

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
Unfinished wooden wreath

54
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,728
Ukrainian suburb what does potholes in the roads in the

55
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
And the tablet to run down and

56
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
Yeah the bus is a

57
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
Third-hand from Pingree

58
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
And suddenly

59
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
Through this gate in the fence of entertaining tale of the universe where everything is brilliant so that Golf Course ever

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
Enclosure for shooting animals

61
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
You're a wild goose people Stop & Shop

62
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
There was a ton of Spanish galleon

63
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
Biltong

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
The side of the river

65
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Look up Pirates

66
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:45,632
Yeah like a pirate ship sort of thing we didn't have an actual Pirate Flag but that's what it looked like and then

67
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
That was his Palace

68
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
Log Cabin

69
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,728
But five stories high

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
The amount of money that have been spent on this

71
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,592
It was absolutely extraordinary

72
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408
Yanukovych should go away in his helicopter in just had it off

73
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
And left it behind

74
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
It was magical

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
In a

76
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,064
Lumos elucidatory while peeing in a dream

77
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,952
The joy of Discovery post-revolution retirement it was no one to stop you doing this if you were curious

78
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Then

79
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,304
You just carried on and you just looked and poked around and one side

80
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,888
It is Palace I kind of got the bug out of other places

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,728
Those other places were also in Ukraine and so Oliver start

82
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Traveling around

83
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
And look at

84
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
And along the way he goes from marveling

85
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
At what he's seeing to be

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,152
Really

87
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
Really angry

88
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,016
Ukrainians are poor the country is a mess

89
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:39,648
And that is what's on his mind when Oliver and his friend Anton walking to yanukovych's

90
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,744
Everything was exactly how we left it near the heated massage table

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,304
Sooner a plunge pool

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
Everything that the loan to perfectly mode

93
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,912
Absolutely surreal

94
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
In the bathroom

95
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,056
Opposite the toilet sitting down heart was a really big television

96
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:02,432
So obviously you know if it'd been in bed watching a TV show and then needed to go to the Loo it

97
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,784
Turn if across and Just Dance continue watching it in the toilet and I've never seen anything

98
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,904
That was the moment that made me really realize how a pulling this man has been

99
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,976
And I said to Anton how did you not stop him

100
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:20,607
And I'm telling you is it polite guy but but you know passion about me some Splendid at me really

101
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,167
How do you say we didn't know we couldn't have known

102
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
Because if you look it up pick it up this Palace

103
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
It isn't even in Ukraine look it up it's in English

104
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,383
What are the three main and you look it up look it up

105
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
I went in and I did look it up on in the land registry

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,783
The area of Lima sewing by Ukrainian

107
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
I'm not Ukrainian company was owned by British

108
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:47,487
The British company was owned by another company and that was his company was owned by the foundation in Liechtenstein

109
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,911
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Noel King

110
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Moneyland

111
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:59,007
Wife thieves and Crooks now rule the world and how to take it back

112
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
We see the world in terms of country

113
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,407
That makes sense trade happens between Sovereign countries

114
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Soda trade Wars

115
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
Countries have their own currencies

116
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
All of this is obvious

117
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,599
But Oliver argues there's a kind of upside down

118
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
A shadow economy just under the surface

119
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
We're money

120
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
Stolen money dirty money

121
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
Is Vanishing into dark

122
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,351
No One taxes that money no one regulates it

123
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
No one can even count

124
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,983
Sometimes money from that Dark World bubbles up into our world

125
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,311
A 90 million-dollar Penthouse that no one is living in

126
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
Stupidly big yacht

127
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,431
And you can make fun of it but Oliver thinks it's dangerous

128
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,991
Is that dark economy gets bigger

129
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
It starts to erode

130
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Countries

131
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,855
It starts to suck the life

132
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
A democracy

133
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047

How to receive $10

Where's off your dress shirt

155
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
So my first question to Oliver

156
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,703
Am I not likely to get to moneyland anytime soon know how much NPR pays its journalists

157
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
I suspect

158
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,359
Well I fear that that you're going to have to work on your kleptocracy skills

159
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
If you want

160
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
Up to it to gain citizenship of money

161
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:47,295
But Oliver decided standing there in that logic that he was going to try to get

162
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Somaliland

163
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
And he got a lucky break

164
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,439
In Ukraine the door into money Land Act

165
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
Accidentally opened up just across

166
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
Because on his way out

167
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
Ukraine president Viktor Yanukovych

168
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
Made a really stupid

169
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
Viktor Yanukovych runs away in a hurry

170
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Embarrassed

171
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,567
Huge volume of incriminating documentation which Show how he structured will his essay

172
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
And how he's hitting his money and money land

173
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
And so that will not panic

174
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,967
Yeah the revolutionaries are coming it's going to be awful

175
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
And I just hope that sink but

176
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Some of dead but not enough of them

177
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:28,767
So when the revolutionaries turn out that this artist Larry floating Bits of Paper bank statements just

178
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Floating in the water

179
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,143
And so they died in in fishdom left again and dry them they draw the Minnesota

180
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
And this

181
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,007
Episode

182
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,079
I did not say that they had this soda priceless

183
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,639
Inside a documentation to show them

184
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
How his

185
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:50,015
Asatru structure how the money flows what's you know who it's been paying off

186
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
And all that it yeah it was

187
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
It it was a it was helping Crack the Code of

188
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,671
You have been doing intensive how we lose it

189
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:02,815
To Country Oliver starts looking into how yanukovych's money is moving around the world and keeps remembering what he

190
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
His friend Anton told

191
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
You know this building is not in Ukraine

192
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
Leaving will then where is it

193
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,543
So he looks up the company that owns the land

194
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
And that the lodge sits on

195
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Any fines in address

196
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
It is not in Ukraine

197
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
It's in London

198
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
29 Harley

199
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,271
It turned out Yanukovych run

200
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
It's two companies that use

201
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
That particular building as their address

202
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
And Oliver thinks

203
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
This is it

204
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,975
He has seen money land on paper

205
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,791
And now he's got a physical address but he can visit

206
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
It's just in central London it's very easy to get to

207
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Just up from Oxford Street

208
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
The big shopping center

209
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,543
The house is a kind of pit at match that's okay to leave a goatee that separately built but they're very lovely

210
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,359
Imprinted on Holly Street it's good.

211
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:53,759
Stained wooden front doors cut like a kind of ballast right at the federal level and then up at the top and other one and I knocked on the door

212
00:08:54,015 --> 00:09:00,159
I'm dumb young man opened it and looked at me so disapprovingly in and I'll shoot me into a conference room this is very boring

213
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Conference room

214
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
Anime Young

215
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
Lady came out

216
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,303
I'm going to chat and she said I'm so you can have to email me the question

217
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
Because being a bit distrustful Journal

218
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,935
And that was the last I heard of her

219
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
That was it he was spoiled

220
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,567
But anyway he was able to go online and find out a little bit about this

221
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
It has an official name is

222
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Cold formation

223
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,967
No more than 2,000 companies Bay seven in a relatively

224
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
1 houses small house

225
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
In that house

226
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
Was a company that creates

227
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
Companies

228
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,415
In the past 10 years hundreds of thousands of companies

229
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
Have been created out of this one house

230
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
It costs little is

231
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,839
20 lb to get a company started in the UK that's about $26

232
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,655
Viktor Yanukovych has two companies were called

233
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
Steward Partners in Blytheville

234
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:51,615
Let me ask you what do those companies actually do with anybody working for astute or 4

235
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
Why did they have employees did they have a

236
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,735
Add icy accountant or bookkeeper who is

237
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
Your funneling money like what

238
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,319
What were those company

239
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,623
Those companies did nothing

240
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
Nautilus companies just existed

241
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
To own property on his behalf

242
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
And it's not just company Mills in London

243
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
Entire countries are doing this

244
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,191
Remember those documents that were thrown in the lake and then dried out in the sauna

245
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,519
Throughout those documents there was one place that

246
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
Kept coming up

247
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
The island of Nevis

248
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
Tilt that was Oliver's next stop

249
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
Nevis island in the Caribbean

250
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,991
I'm which is a sort of jurisdiction size version of the

251
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
House of Harley Street

252
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
It exists to provide people with anonymity

253
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,903
The laws were written for it by a group of American lawyers

254
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
He wanted

255
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Essentially

256
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:43,327
To make it easier for people who have been sued or who would divorcing that wives to 2

257
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
2 hydroxy

258
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,911
Oliver has some specific addresses on need

259
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
So he gets on the boat and go slow

260
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
I'm actually hard to find them

261
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
But they're all in an area about the size of a football pitch

262
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
I got off the Dyson the first

263
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Hocus Pocus

264
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Is directly opposite me

265
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
And then there's another one

266
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,503
I'm jealous. Wait another 100 yards in the other direction.

267
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
It's absolutely tiny

268
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
Reese real

269
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Because

270
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
All of these dresses in my head were

271
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
Like cuddle mcmafia addresses

272
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,279
Hideout to the mafia and then.

273
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Custody plan office block

274
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
Fox Weather with a couple of receptionist

275
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
I went all the way there

276
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
And essentially have to serve

277
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,007
Couple of hours wandering around all done old

278
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:28,639
Came that do intend to knocking on doors and I just ended up sitting in a bar on the beach and ghetto eating fly fishing

279
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Drinking beer

280
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
When you were in Nevis

281
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
Did anyone tell you anything worthwhile

282
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,087
I had this extraordinary encounter with the regulator

283
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,903
Because he's essentially in charge of checking the Integrity of

284
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
The financial system

285
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
And

286
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,535
It was one of the most extraordinary interviews I've ever done in my life I mean

287
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
She just lost me

288
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,119
From beginning to end

289
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,447
I didn't mean that. You didn't see

290
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,567
Maybe he didn't see the humor in it but here's an argument in their favor

291
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,199
Maybe it was funny because he was acting like a detective on the trail of

292
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Something that is

293
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,319
A normal totally legal way of doing business

294
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
It would be like if you went into a night

295
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
And you said

296
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
I travelled across the world

297
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
I took a boat to get here

298
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,071
Are you people really just openly selling furniture

299
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
They would laugh in your face

300
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:27,519
So from there he's kind of stuck no one in any of these places is going to give him any information

301
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,359
But even though the money in moneyland is hidden

302
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
Somebody's going to start

303
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Bubbling up in various

304
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Specifically

305
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
The really

306
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,903
Extraordinary thing is where the money gets spent is where ends up and where ends up is overwhelmingly and under the New York it's like the outside

307
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
I doubt he's losing

308
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:45,951
Into our world

309
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
You want to put your money somewhere weather

310
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
This lovely all calories great restaurants

311
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
Georgia Parkson

312
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
New York

313
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,471
So it's it's the desert of the really uncomfortable truth

314
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
At the Hop

315
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
This whole episode

316
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,103
Is the fact that we criticize you know

317
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
At the Marshall Islands

318
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,247
Juanita Solis revolve show me pom Fringe destinations for

319
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Enabling fraud and Theft

320
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Which they are enabling

321
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Prudent

322
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,975
But it's where the money ends up it's important to the money ends up in in London New York Miami

323
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Los Angeles

324
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Expensify.

325
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,095
Annie's get some things that have been really hard to

326
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Explain

327
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Like how is he

328
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,447
Former presidential campaign chairman

329
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
Who's done some Consulting work in Ukraine

330
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,335
Able to buy millions of dollars of rug

331
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,639
Send suits and a townhouse in

332
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
I'm talking of course about Palmetto

333
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
I think the really interesting thing about Paul manafort

334
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
Is the fact that he did

335
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
Exactly the same tricks

336
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,391
As the ukrainians did

337
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,439
If you look at the indictment I love

338
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
Paul manafort indictment I practically have

339
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,767
You're stuck on my wall

340
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,815
It's so wonderfully

341
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
4 nut

342
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,191
The structures that he used

343
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:05,055
To move his money through we had companies in Cyprus you had company a company in the UK

344
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,871
Notification on Holly Street Priscilla company in the UK

345
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,175
He had a company's in the Caribbean is it

346
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,527
The Grenadines he had a whole string of LLCs in in the US

347
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
The tricks he was using what exactly the same tricks

348
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
Is being used by

349
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
Ukrainian

350
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
Cat scratch that yanukovych's Indiana Convention

351
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Just friends

352
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
How do I think

353
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
What's really interesting about

354
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,399
Manifold is doing is it shows that this is not a crime of culture

355
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,191
This is a crime of opportunity

356
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
It an American

357
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
Youku

358
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
Essentially see his way to

359
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
Don't jinx greasy touching taxes

360
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
You're keeping money in the same way

361
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,967
Didn't I see you crying and it was doing it typically cut

362
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Because he could

363
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
And that's just it it's that easy

364
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
And it is also easy to not think

365
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
Too much about this

366
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
But Oliver is

367
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Obsessed

368
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,023
Because remember he spent years working in Eastern Europe

369
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
In Russia and you

370
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Ukraine

371
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,119
And Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan and

372
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,143
Tajikistan

373
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,983
And he's learned that when a country's money is Vanishing down the drain

374
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
And I can't be

375
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
We found ortak

376
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
Store even counted

377
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
There is something very big at

378
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,967
Mistake we need to deal with this issue if democracy is to have a future

379
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
If some people cannot pronounce whole

380
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
That legislative and Taxation prices

381
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
And that is a threat

382
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Democracy

383
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
Because otherwise you end up in a situation

384
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
What you doing Russia

385
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Where

386
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,047
More than half of all the money in Russia resigned offshore it's in Manila

387
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
52 PSI

388
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
Of the household wealth

389
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
So it's 52

390
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,519
Send 52%. Money is essentially no longer subject to the to the decisions of the Russian government

391
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
Now you can understand why

392
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,175
If you were rushing the wealthy Russian you might not want your money to be subject to the decisions of the Russian

393
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Yeah

394
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:52,575
Hopelessly you can put that's very bad for democracy or any chance of democratic transformation

395
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,135
It's important for democracy that money can be tax

396
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
Because that's how democracies found himself

397
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,975
Taxes are the price we pay for civilization

398
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,327
That figure by the way 52% of Russian money is offshore

399
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,679
That's an estimate from The Economist Gabriel zucman who studies tax Havens

400
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
So big

401
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
What are the

402
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
Well

403
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,567
I mean the real Ethiopia state

404
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
The thing that we will need to do

405
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
Is find a way to stop

406
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
I'm hiding

407
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Dialysis

408
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,783
We need transparency Battleship so shall company doesn't work anymore

409
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,087
It's a very important principle because

410
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
Even the FBI

411
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Find the product

412
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
Could find out who owns a company in Delaware

413
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,743
You left alone in the investigator

414
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
Authorities in inside out

415
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,167
And inside it makes it very easy just hide your identity behind a Delaware company and and you and your home free

416
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
You're that should stop

417
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,287
When Oliver was chasing this money he talked to fbih

418
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,615
Santa law enforcement officials who are working this be

419
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,663
And it is maddening

420
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,759
Trying to unpack that traded companies you have to go to every single one of those country

421
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
To find out who owns the company

422
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
And then once you found out that actually has just done somewhere else

423
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
You have to go to another country if I know who I am

424
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
Eventually you will end up possibly

425
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,863
Finding out who ends up but yes would have come by and by that sector I would have happily moved somewhere else with my soupy outside

426
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
Yeah it is

427
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,703
It's become incredibly easy

428
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
To steal money and hide

429
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
End

430
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Then enjoy it

431
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,103
Suspended of course there is one big problem

432
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
A lot of people and a lot of places are making a good living catering to money land or being part of it

433
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
The problem is

434
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
How do you persuade Delaware

435
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,671
When the Delaware state budget is is heavily dependent on Incorporation

436
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,999
How do you persuade South Dakota

437
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Did they should stop

438
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
Party pitabilities behind trusts

439
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
When is South Dakota trust Industries absolutely blooming

440
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
I mean not see that's the argument over

441
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
For this isn't it I mean

442
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Is economy

443
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
Estates would say

444
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Plenty of people who are not

445
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Are starting

446
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
Funny people have legitimate reason

447
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
Thanks for wanting to

448
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Keep their wealth

449
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
Are using RC

450
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,271
Services are setting up

451
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,831
And so what are you doing

452
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:06,719
But we need to say yes if you have a legitimate reason to own your property honestly that should be allowed for everyone

453
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
Illegitimate reason like

454
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
You live in a really unstable country

455
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,447
You don't want people to know how much money you have because somebody might kidnap your kids and hold them for ransom

456
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
In the courts are usually decide you pass a law that says you know these are the people who have the right to anonymity people who have a legitimate fear

457
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,407
Security and that you got you done

458
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
I'm very straightforward

459
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,015
But the problem is if you were to

460
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,879
Positive words that make sure you'll eventually gassing the state budget of evil

461
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,439
Jurisdictions in countries all over the world by satellite

462
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,351
It what do they do to make up the shortfall that which is the money that made from incorporating

463
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,167
Companies for people who want anonymity and what are you do

464
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,239
I'm it it's it difficult but we absolutely have

465
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
To do this because

466
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
This money is

467
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
Poisoning the world

468
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,199
We don't know an economist will cop to this

469
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
How much of this money there is

470
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
An educated estimate around 8

471
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
Percent of all the money in the world

472
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
Is in that upside down

473
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,719
No taxes being paid no names attached

474
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,047
Just waiting to come up to the surface and

475
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
Buy more stuff

476
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,143
Oliver tells this story

477
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,935
About walking around his neighborhood

478
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
Put in London

479
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,519
The shop where he buys his coffee every morning

480
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
That building is owned in the Bahama

481
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
The building where he gets his haircut

482
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,663
Is owned in Gibraltar

483
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,991
Is a building site he passes when he walks to the train

484
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,807
That is owned in the Isle of Man

485
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,623
Any wonders who owns those buildings

486
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:44,511
And he wonders if the money that bought them should be paying for roads or hospitals in some other country

487
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,095
But the odds are Oliver like the rest of us

488
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
Won't ever figure it out

489
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,471

You have fifteen Amazon reviews and all of them are five stars and all of them are people who wrote like

519
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,519
Relatively long reviews saying how much
