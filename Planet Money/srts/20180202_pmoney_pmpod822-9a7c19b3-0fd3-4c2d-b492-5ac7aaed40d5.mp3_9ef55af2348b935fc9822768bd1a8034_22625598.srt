1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,048
Quick note there is

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,840
A cuss word on Today Show

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,888
Hey hey what's up

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,936
Right now we're going to connect

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,704
Shortly yeah

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,056
Okay cool I'm sitting in a studio that he is connected to another Studio

7
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,152
K UT in Austin Texas and we're waiting on this ticket broker

8
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:17,920
To show up

9
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
And tell us the story of the 2000

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,992
15 Super Bowl

11
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,784
So got the tape rolling

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,832
Any second his voice should pop up

13
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,392
But then our producer Jess Chun burst

14
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
Back into the studio

15
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:34,304
Trying to get him on the phone he was standing out of cuties like I don't see any benefit from this

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,096
You like getting cold feet

17
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,656
What did he say

18
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:43,264
Just pulls out her phone's pulls up an email from the broker

19
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,568
I'm sitting outside the station but

20
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:51,968
I don't see any benefit that could come from this thank you for your time and energy but I have to decline for my

21
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,504
Leon Saturday

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
Decline

23
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
For my own sanity hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Kenny Malone

24
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
Noel King

25
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,560
And Super Bowl is this weekend it's the Eagles versus the past

26
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
The Super Bowl is

27
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,144
Of course a huge economy in and of itself

28
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,960
And nowhere is this more visible than in one

29
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Crazy

30
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Market

31
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
Ticket sales

32
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,848
Usually the Super Bowl is a bonanza for professional ticket sales

33
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,128
People usually

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
But the 2015 Super Bowl

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
Was very good

36
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,784
And this is the reason no one wants to talk about

37
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,088
Because in the two weeks leading up to

38
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
The game there was a

39
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
Catastrophic

40
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
Market collapse in mini

41
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,000
Brokers went belly up tickets vanished Into Thin Air

42
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,328
Companies had to Shell out millions of dollars to try and fix

43
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
The great Super Bowl ticket collapse

44
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,216
Today on the show we're going to try and figure out what happened and

45
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,800
We did find somebody willing to tell us about this

46
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
From the inside

47
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,640
And so we're to talk about like on air because it's like one of those things is

48
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
Do we even want to talk about

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
Super Bowl 49 ever again

I'm going to have you start by just saying your name it's Ray

64
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,480
Chateau s8000 how should we identify you devoted

65
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Seattle Seahawks fan

66
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
That works for me

67
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,344
Reese Auto has been a Seahawks

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
Season ticket holder since 90

69
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
Teen 76 that is

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
The first year there was

71
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,048
Not in the last 15 years the Seahawks have been very good

72
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,864
But in the beginning they were very bad

73
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
Re-watch

74
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
And cheered

75
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
And dealt with decades

76
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Ups and down

77
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
So it's a 2014 mm

78
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,848
15 C's in any shaping up to be like

79
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
Mediocre at

80
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
Six games in and the sea

81
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
Seahawks had a mideling record

82
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,808
Being raised a loyal fan and like many loyal fans

83
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,088
He just had a

84
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
Feeling that maybe the Seahawks could turn it around

85
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,952
And even though the Super Bowl was months away

86
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Re-found a ticket

87
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
Who offered

88
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Pretty straightforward.

89
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
If Ray paid like a deposit

90
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
This guy

91
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
Would go and get him a ticket

92
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
For the Super Bowl

93
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
If the Seahawks made

94
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
If they don't make it

95
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,800
Ray loses the deposit but

96
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
He decides it's worth the risk

97
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
Tilray put the money down couple hundred bucks

98
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,736
And his team turned the season around they make

99
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,344
The playoffs

100
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,184
Internet what is 14 days before the 2015 Super Bowl

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,488
The Seattle Seahawks are playing the Green Bay Packer

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
Ray was at this game watching

103
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
The Seahawks

104
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
And this game

105
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,704
It's part of the day that's known as Championship Sunday because it's the day we find out which teams

106
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
Will be in the Super

107
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
And the Seahawks

108
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Force the Packers

109
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
Overtime

110
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
And they won this improbable game

111
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
And are now going to the Superbowl

112
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
5 in

113
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Is really just unbelievable

114
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,440
And it's an extra sweet for you because you happen to know

115
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,256
That you were going to get to go and follow this improbable run

116
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,280
Absolutely

117
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
The best part of this

118
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
Dealray had made with the broke

119
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
Was not just that he was getting 2 tickets

120
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
The Super Bowl

121
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
The broker was going to sell them to him

122
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
Face value

123
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
$800 a day

124
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,871
Which sounds like a lot to me but it is a steel for sale

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
Repay the broker for two tickets

126
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
And the broker is like

127
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,759
Congratulations you are going

128
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Super Bowl 4

129
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
49

130
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
In Glendale Arizona

131
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
We will have your tickets in hand

132
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
In person

133
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
The day before

134
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
Everybody wins

135
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
But

136
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Here's a twist

137
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,863
You know the ticket broker who wouldn't talk to us in the interest of his own sanity

138
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
That guy was raised ticket broker

139
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
And wasn't a scammer

140
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
He wasn't trying to defraud right

141
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
But would he enraged didn't know yet

142
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,871
Was that they had just jumped into one of the most UPS

143
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,967
Side down bass-ackwards ticket markets in Super Bowl history

144
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,295
Would you say you are a leading expert

145
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
In ticket mark

146
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Without sounding pompous yes

147
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
I think I've done a lot of work in tickets

148
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
This is Pascal

149
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,815
Preserve economix at the University of Victoria

150
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,655
And I've been studying ticket markets for the past 20 years

151
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Super Bowl tickets

152
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
Are already a weird Market

153
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
Because if you're not an NFL player or an NFL

154
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
Spell sponsor or

155
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
A very very lucky

156
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
A season ticket holder for a Super Bowl team

157
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
You almost have no chance of getting a suit

158
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
Not directly

159
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
It's not for face value

160
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
On the primary mark

161
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,623
So the market is

162
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
Secondary Market the resale Mart

163
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,767
And Pascal says if you study that resale market like he does

164
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,071
Ticket prices have followed a very

165
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
Predictable pattern yes so if you look at the past

166
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:03,519
A few years that would be the general pattern for the Super Bowl definitely but also for many other sports

167
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,895
We call these markets perishable good and the idea is that once the event starts

168
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
The value of your ticket goes down dramatically

169
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
Pascal says that

170
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,575
For the Super Bowl what the pattern looks like is this

171
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,927
14 days before the big game the day we find out which two teams will be

172
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Keep playing

173
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
Ticket prices start to go up

174
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,071
The most exuberant fans are buying tickets there

175
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,143
The driving the price up and then we get closer to the game

176
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
The prices start

177
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
To drop

178
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
Because it because it

179
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Imagine you're a fan

180
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
You didn't buy your

181
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
Take it yet and Euphoria is wearing off

182
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,175
And you're looking at all hotels are $1,000 a night

183
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
And the flight to 1200 bucks

184
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Anythink

185
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
I don't really need to go to the zoo

186
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
And at the same time

187
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Ticket sellers art

188
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
Once this game start

189
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
This ticket I have

190
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
Is nothing more than a souvenir

191
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
I had better by John

192
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,863
And then last few days then you have a Southern drawl

193
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,447
What is the I feel like if we see it often there should be a name for this

194
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,799
Is there like a does it have a cool economics name

195
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,151
Do you want to name it to have any suggestions last minute deep or something like that

196
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,223
The last minute dip is fine with me I it also sounds like

197
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
What you bring

198
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,807
To a Superbowl party when someone's like oh by the way can

199
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
Can you bring something on my

200
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:26,207
No I don't have anything I guess I can bring a dip at the last minute

201
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:31,327
Just about every part of the Super Bowl ticket economy is built on this pattern holding

202
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,703
14 days out prices are going to go up and then there will be this last minute

203
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
All of the

204
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Professionals in the ticket industry

205
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Are betting on me

206
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
So why the Seahawks

207
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
Where in Seattle winning their way in

208
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
3000 miles away in New York City

209
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
Brett Goldberg

210
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
Is obsessively

211
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
Watching TV

212
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
So the second the Seahawks won

213
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Order start

214
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Flying in

215
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
Like crazy

216
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
What is the co CEO of a company called

217
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Tickpick

218
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
Tickpick

219
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,863
Did you want to share your unofficial tagline or is that an off mic only

220
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Oh that one

221
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,983
I was about to say when most people know what stuff all this so

222
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
What do you do

223
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
Instead of giving in the Longwood an answer

224
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
We're like step up a better

225
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
Beretta course of the whole explanation

226
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
Infer why he thinks

227
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Side is better but

228
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
Rent is one of the

229
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
Few people we found

230
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,599
Who's willing to talk about 2015 from the inside

231
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
And if you're trying to figure out where Brett sits in this

232
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
Chicken ecosystem

233
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
He and his website are a middleman be

234
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
Between the fans and the ticket

235
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,119
Bretelles is one of the reasons the Superbowl is

236
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Particularly

237
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,215
Is the 14 days before the game when that demand

238
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
Ticket starts to spike

239
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
The majority of the tickets

240
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
Are not out into the world yet

241
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,687
The NFL is still holding on to ticket waiting to release them two teams and

242
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Players and

243
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
Maybe sponsors

244
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
And it takes a while for those two

245
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,063
To get out onto the secondary Market

246
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
So when the Championship Sunday

247
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
With the vast majority of

248
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
People are actually

249
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,255
Buying from Brett Goldbergs website and other websites like bread

250
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
Is the promise

251
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,559
I would take it

252
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Get from a broker

253
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
There are two kinds of tick

254
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
First

255
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
They're the ones who

256
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
Know what they're doing

257
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Sell you a ticket and they know it

258
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Exactly where it's going to come for

259
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
They know a guy who's

260
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
Company somehow gets tickets

261
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
And there's going to be an extra one

262
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
And that's the ticket the broker is selling you

263
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
And then there is the other type

264
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,295
Type and sometimes you'll hear these guys called speculate

265
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,855
Diesel you would take care of the promise if it's

266
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,927
Tickets and then they go hustle they go find one for you

267
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,791
But when they sold it to you they didn't know exactly where it was coming from

268
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,607
And it may not have been cleared to you

269
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
But you haven't actually bought a realtor

270
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Now this seems

271
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Crazy

272
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
Like it's an invisible ticket

273
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,847
But it is something that happens in financial markets both cases

274
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
Are versions of with called a naked

275
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,479
Short sale yet when you're convinced prices will go down

276
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,551
You offer something for sale that you don't own yet but you

277
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
You promised that you

278
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,367
You will get it and you'll deliver it later

279
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,695
Now that was what was going on in this big secondary Market

280
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
And also on Brett's website

281
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,303
Were you okay with people using your website to speculate

282
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
In hindsight

283
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
Definitely not

284
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
But we have no reason to believe that

285
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,215
There were problems

286
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
Us someone wants

287
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
If you get it in writing

288
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
You're going to feel

289
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
You're obligated to do this

290
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
The industry the resale industry as

291
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
As a whole

292
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Is built on trust

293
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
These are Brokers livelihood

294
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
And they're going to sell these order

295
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
And the reason this worked fine

296
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
For the Super Bowl 4 years

297
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,695
Is because ticket prices always took

298
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
That last

299
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
And the salt and Brokers mines were

300
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,583
I can sell this at $2,000

301
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
And

302
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
Couple days before this

303
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
Super Bowl I could buy it

304
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
$1,500

305
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Maybe a thousand

306
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
This is the easiest $500 of my life

307
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
The easiest

308
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,847
$500

309
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Of your

310
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
Set a countdown is it 14 days

311
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
14 days until the Super Bowl

312
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,599
And there is a real sense that we are truly going to see the two best teams

313
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
Prices are still going up 13 days

314
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
Until the Superbowl 3012 Tesla

315
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Three and a half thousand

316
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
This is kind of in line with the trends

317
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
I'm tracking this like a hardcore

318
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,423
Everyday every hour I'm refreshing all rap

319
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
One week

320
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,287
Until the Super Bowl prices are still going I had never in our history

321
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
Kind of seen it push it

322
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
$4,000

323
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
5000 6060

324
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
5 days

325
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,295
Until the Super Bowl on StubHub they start at more than $7,000

326
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
And now it's

327
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
Clear something is going on

328
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:43,231
Ticket prices we've been reporting for the Super Bowl already at a record high today or Seahawks

329
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Andres Auto

330
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
Is watching all of it

331
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,143
Remember he bought his tickets for $800 I'm thinking man I got a good deal with this option

332
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
It's true

333
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,751
Ray doesn't have his actual physical paper ticket

334
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
It yet but he's thinking look

335
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
I already paid for it

336
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,151
It must be my ticket and I was just smart enough

337
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,551
To lock in a really great price were you thinking like maybe I should sell this took

338
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
Across your mind but I

339
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,183
Pretty devoted to going this is my first Superbowl

340
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
Yeah I got to go

341
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
Brett Goldberg on the other hand.

342
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Air ticket middle name

343
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
He's been watching these prices

344
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Go up and

345
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
4 days

346
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
He is been

347
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
Worried and info

348
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,959
For me I was a little late but red flags went up like

349
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
What is going on

350
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
This is

351
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,847
This is really scary just to be clear I mean you're making a cut of sales

352
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
It seems like a great thing the prices are going

353
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,967
But you're saying there's something to be alarmed about yeah

354
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
Because of the ticket speculators

355
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Because of the naked shorts

356
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,391
I was not aware how exposed we were but I was aware there was exposed

357
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Misses when I start

358
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Pair like

359
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
I need to be

360
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Prepared

361
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
That some of the shorts may not get

362
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
It felt so what are you saying is

363
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
Brent knew that some of the people who

364
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,447
Who sold tickets early on for like two grand on his website

365
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,263
They did not have a clue where those tickets were going to come from

366
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,615
They assume just like every year that they buy them during the last minute tip

367
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
But now there was no dipping

368
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
It was just speaking

369
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,015
That we talk to as many people as we could

370
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
About y2000

371
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
Why ticket prices went up

372
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Instead of down

373
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
And here's what we can piece together

374
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
Super Bowl 49

375
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
Was this

376
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
Tornado

377
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Compounding Factor

378
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
Here's that sent prices

379
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
For starters it seems like brokers

380
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,751
Completely underestimated how many people wanted to go to this game

381
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
Here's why

382
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
The Patriots

383
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
Are always in the Super Bowl

384
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,431
And the Seahawks had just won their first ever Super Bowl the year before

385
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,759
So logically the Brokers are thinking that people are going to be less interested this time

386
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
And it appears

387
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
They got that very wrong

388
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:50,207
Secondly the reports from the ground are that the NFL released some of the tick

389
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
It's later

390
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
10 brokers

391
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
Expected later than usual

392
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
This made them nervous

393
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
This made them willing

394
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
To pay more for the

395
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
That were available and may have driven the price up

396
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Further

397
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
And the final factor is that

398
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
It looks like 2008

399
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
15 with a year that so many people

400
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,895
People piled into the ticket speculation game

401
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
Victor bubble just

402
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
They sold

403
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,247
Way more tickets

404
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Promises that make

405
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
Could possibly deliver

406
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,575
The market was

407
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
Built on naked short-selling

408
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
In a market like that

409
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
Is a bomb

410
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
Waiting to go off

411
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
Just days now from the biggest

412
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
How big games the fans

413
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
All to sending here on the greater Phoenix

414
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
The Super Bowl is now

415
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
3 days away

416
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Until

417
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
Prices are through the roof

418
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,311
Thousands of people are starting to show up in Glendale Arizona thinking they bought

419
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,383
Super Bowl tickets ahead of time

420
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
+ 2500 miles away

421
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,503
@brett Goldberg's office in New York City

422
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
The first Domino

423
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
False yes Thursday was the

424
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
What was the first time I realized that

425
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
One of our sellers wasn't going to

426
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
A call comes in to

427
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
Tickpick office

428
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
It is a broker

429
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Saying essentially

430
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
I give up

431
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
I know I sold someone a ticket on

432
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
Website for like 2500 bucks

433
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
But it's crazy out here

434
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
78 Grand I can't find

435
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,311
Anythinganywhere cheap enough to make this work

436
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
We're sucking worried we're nervous

437
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
I mean I so Thursday when that call came in

438
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
I started running the books and I said okay

439
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Worst case

440
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:20,831
Rick Goldberg website that helps sell about 200 Super Bowl tickets

441
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,159
And now he starts looking at every single ticket perch

442
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,511
Like who sold this ticket do I know this person do I trust this person

443
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
Also that was Michael

444
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,607
Concern is for people who have bought tickets at $2,000

445
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Brokers. Are in a gallon

446
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
Cricket 1800

447
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
And how the heck are these Brokers going to fill these orders

448
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
We need to fill these orders

449
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,079
Never memberpress himself is not a broker his job is not

450
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
To go and buy tickets and then sell the

451
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
But imagine if

452
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
You're that fat

453
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
You bought it

454
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
YouTube Red

455
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,575
You are going to blame Brett just as much as you're going to blame the broker

456
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Build on your own

457
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Sabrett is getting desk

458
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,439
He is sending guys to Arizona

459
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
With cash

460
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Iwired

461
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,791
$50,000 in cash

462
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,839
To one of my guys I was going there

463
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
So that we can start start buying tickets

464
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
It's as well basically

465
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,727
Feeling that person's backpack in cash

466
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
Returning to dab

467
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,359
Broker more or less right we need a booty to buy tickets and to make matters worse

468
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,175
StubHub which is Brett's big competitor

469
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
Is being forced

470
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
To do the same thing

471
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,039
Put on a market-moving scale

472
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,111
StubHub spends millions of dollars making up for

473
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
Busted short sales on their website

474
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,511
They get enough tickets to get every single one of their customers into the Super

475
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Brett says

476
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
For the tickets that are left

477
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
That only drive the price up more

478
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
And he simply could not afford to do

479
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Do the same thing for

480
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
His customers

481
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,239
Company was too new

482
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
He did not have it

483
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Kind of money

484
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
Bought up as many tickets

485
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
Secret Ford

486
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,919
He says in total about 30 orders went bust

487
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
He was able to fill about half of

488
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
And for the rest of the fans

489
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,319
Just going to have to reimburse them

490
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
T travel they paid for

491
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
And then give them about it

492
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
200% refund

493
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,255
Which is still cheaper than buying the tickets

494
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
But he had to start making

495
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
King some very difficult

496
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Difficult phone call

497
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
I ministered this was like the

498
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
The worst day of my life

499
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
Career working ever

500
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,751
Like you having to call someone to tell him to not get on a plane right now

501
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
When you'd like

502
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,639
The reason why we created business was to send people to get tickets for events

503
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
Psoriasis

504
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
Is the exact opposite

505
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,575
And so we're to talk about like on air because it's like one of those things it's like

506
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,903
Do we even want to talk about Super Bowl XLIX ever again

507
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Sphere

508
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,839
Emotions and how we get it brings up a lot like the plumber like

509
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,935
Cry but I could cry thinking about like what we had to do to something

510
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
Calls like this were going out

511
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
All over

512
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
2 days before the Super Bowl

513
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
Seahawks Super

514
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
Fan race Auto

515
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,407
How does hotel booked in Arizona

516
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
He and his wife

517
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,223
Packed and ready to leave the next morning

518
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
After breakfast

519
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
He opens his laptop

520
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
And there's an email

521
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
From his broke

522
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
And its subject line what

523
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
Atwells Bobby Super Bowl tickets

524
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,023
You see it and what are you like before you can open it what do you think

525
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:14,143
I got all know said sorry guys I don't have tickets

526
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,727

00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,799
And I'll give you your money back plus 20% and

528
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Sorry

529
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,151
You didn't throw the laptop across the room or anyting

530
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
It was a

531
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
A quiet

532
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
Anger

533
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:32,319
The quiet anger yeah kind of a disappointment and anger

534
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,671
The broker gave right his money back plus a couple extra hundred bucks to say

535
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
I am so sorry

536
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:43,583
Rain is wife talked it over they were very bummed but they decided they were going to drive to Arizona anyway

537
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:50,239
Just be part of the festivities races the scene in Arizona

538
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
It was bizarre

539
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
They were obviously

540
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
Fans but then there were these like

541
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
Light clusters

542
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
Of miserable desperate

543
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,711
Almost like Panhandle

544
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Holding up

545
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
These homemade signs

546
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
Cardboard signs people

547
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,647
Sitting in the middle of the crowd just watching people walk by into the pep rally

548
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,207
With their kids with them trying to

549
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,839
Stir some sympathy and it was just like willing to pay $10,000

550
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,375
I guess not

551
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Good Lord

552
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
It was just insanity

553
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,775
Sir and his wife getting the car they leave Arizona and they drive to

554
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,847
California to raise parents house to watch the action

555
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
And I don't know if you remember Super Bowl 40

556
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
But the Seahawks

557
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
Had the ball

558
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,759
With a chance to win the game

559
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
From like a yard away from

560
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
From the endzone

561
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,695
For the entire country it seemed as if they were about

562
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
To win the Super

563
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,631
Russell Wilson

564
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
Seahawks

565
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,983
Chose to throw the ball

566
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,263
Run it

567
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
And they lost

568
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,871
They threw an interception after the interception in my mouth

569
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
Dropped open

570
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
In disbelief

571
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,247
And the next thing I turn in my wife

572
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
And go

573
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
My God

574
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,623
I can't imagine being at this game

575
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,439
Can you think of what the drive home would have been like

576
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,743
I mean in some ways

577
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,583
Maybe maybe you have these tickets short-sellers to thank for

578
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
Avoiding a lot of misery

579
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,263
The artist the only reason I didn't know I can laugh about it and

580
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
And you know

581
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:33,919
Just let it go it's a fact that it was such a difficult ending for the Seattle fans

582
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,855
Are the Super Bowl is days away and after all this you may be wondering

583

When the 2050

Teen ticket Bubble Burst

595
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
There were a lot of pissed off

596
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
People they had paid

597
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Hotels they

Book airline tickets some of them had already

599
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Shown up

00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,599
To Arizona

601
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,903
And a lot of those pissed off people

602
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
Got in touch with a man

603
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,536
Name of Bob Ferguson you're making me go back in time to this

604
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,168
Painful experience during a Seahawks jersey right now general for the

605
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
The state of Washington

606
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
He was wearing that Seahawks jersey in his office

607
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
He's a huge fan

608
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,592
Mm

609
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,408
15 Super Bowl his tickets worked out fine but

610
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
Outside of the stadium

611
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
He kept running in

612
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
The devastated fan

613
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
After devastated fan

614
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,576
Bob eventually went after upper

615
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Particularly

616
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
Egregious ticket broker who wasn't even reimbursing

617
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
When their tickets.

618
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,000
And so because there were lawsuits and

619
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,304
A lot of bad press and a really expensive

620
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
Meltdown

621
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,656
The Super Bowl ticket Market does seem to be safer today

622
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
Companies like StubHub and tick

623
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Texas ticket middlemen

624
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
Have cracked down on

625
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Tickets back in

626
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,384
Getting that require anybody who wants to sell a Super Bowl ticket

627
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
To either have a proof of purchase

628
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:16,064
Or to be a certified trusted broker with a history of delivering on Super Bowl ticket

629
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
It promises

630
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,392
Bob Ferguson Attorney General for washing

631
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,720
Chicken says you should still be pretty careful when making a giant

632
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,000
Purchase like this

633
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
And if it falls through

634
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
You may have recourse

635
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
You may be able to file a lawsuit

636
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
Speaking of which before I let Bob go

637
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
I had to ask him about something

638
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
It stuck out to me

639
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752
Hey I noticed in the lawsuit

640
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
The complaint

641
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:42,176
There's a little flowery language around the Seahawks quote-unquote thrilling victory over the Green Bay Packers to advance to the super

642
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,968
Super Bowl

643
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:47,552
Did you put that in there I just didn't spend that sounds like something I would do it yes yeah

644
00:22:55,744 --> 00:23:01,888

A Patriots fan who also went up without a ticket yes just did happen to Patriots fans to

651
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,600
As far as we can tell it's maybe the only bad thing that's ever happened to Patriots fans

652
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,392
