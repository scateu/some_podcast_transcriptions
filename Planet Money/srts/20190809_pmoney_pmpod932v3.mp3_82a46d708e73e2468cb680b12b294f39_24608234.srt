Okay Dina temple-raston

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
Yes I think we're going to just start with

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,208
A single-minded mission that you had in East Africa in Malawi

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
Define denote

15
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
To find an elephant and record it

16
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,304
In-person correct

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,096
Up close and personal with an elf

18
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
Okay so this is our first night and what they do is they say look we're going to

19
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:48,896
Go out on the river everybody please

20
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296
In this River and people are very much in Romanian

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
Everywhere you look there are animals popping up

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
Dropping into the water and coming up

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,496
We're completely focused on these hippos

24
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
All of a sudden this

25
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
Elephants

26
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
Come off the hill

27
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,128
And start walking towards the water

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,920
And of course we were all

29
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
No tape

30
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
Okay idiot

31
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,600
But the truth is that if you want to be really close to an elephant you have to go online

32
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:35,488
We saw the fresh dung piles along the road and followed those found him in this clearing sure enough

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
Right in front of us is this

34
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
Steve normis elephant

35
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:45,728
And you think an elephant is so huge that you'd hear him walking all the time but what they say is the only time you here in LA

36
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
Washington's when he's coming any breaks a branch or when he's eating and all we got was an elephant eating

37
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
It was magical I was sewing

38
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,880
I found it so magical but to see them in the wild is magical

39
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,744
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Kenny Malone

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,584
Today on the show a quest to record the sounds of an elephant

41
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Because

42
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
Elephants are being killed at such an alarming rate experts say they may be extinct in some countries in as few as ten

43
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,104
And years and recording elephant audio is a critical first step

44
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
In Saving the olive

45
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,968
We have a story about how researchers tried to pull off a kind of

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,272
Old school style house scheme

47
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:36,672
And to do that they had to steal a page from Silicon Valley and Wall Street

48
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
Hiding in trees secret recordings but also artificial intelligence and finally

49
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
We will have to understand

50
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
What a neural network actually does

51
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,240
Plus some of the most incredible audio recordings we've ever

00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,128
It's about a really uplifting subject it's about the stagnation of our economy

63

Where can people get that sweet sweet contact npr.org Planet Money newsletter that's why I can say that

64
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
That's what I can sign up yeah

65
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
Alright so I just want to try this thing

66
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Okay

67
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,584
Turn your headphones down just a little bit OIC

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
Miss a long time

69
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
Is that you that's me

70
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
Okay it's me and it's the best

71
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:02,176
Animal impression I can do bad and when we think of elephants that's the sound we think of that trumpeting sound

72
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
But it's basically an elephant child

73
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,088
That's right by far the most frequent kind of vocalization we call a rumble

74
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,648
Which is very low frequency

75
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Peter rig is an elephant scientist

76
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Cornell University

77
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,887
And he's the director of something called The Elephant listening

78
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
It's a team of researchers that works in the rainforests of sin

79
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
We called Peter

80
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
I mean honestly a little bit because

81
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
We wanted to ask him every elephant

82
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,407
We ever had are elephants really scared of mice

83
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,271
Not at all that's a Disney thing that's all from the cartoons but also

84
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
We computer because

85
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
Just a few years ago

86
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
There was

87
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Huge news

88
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,415
If you were an elf

89
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,487
A new study the great elephant census

90
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,119
Congestive failure to protect the world's largest land mammals the great elephant census was basically

91
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
The separate account every elephant Oliver after

92
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,031
Because that's the first step and knowing how fast they're being killed off

93
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
And where is specifically they're dying

94
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
There was a big copier

95
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,175
Did the study though the great elephant census

96
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
Depended very heavily on

97
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Small aircraft

98
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,575
In the savanna you can fly over it and count

99
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Herds of elephants

100
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
That is not possible to do in the rain

101
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:20,255
The great elephant census had to leave out the Forest elephant

102
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,815
The exact species of elephant

103
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
Peter specializes in

104
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,423
Yeah that's the Forest elephant is the smallest

105
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,031
Of the three species of elephants and their Ivory is the most

106
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,431
Apprised of any Ivory because it's denser than Savanna elephant Ivory and it has a pinkish tinge

107
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,271
So Peter and his team set out to see if there is a way to

108
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,319
Count this elusive foristell

109
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
In problem number 1

110
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,719
Is yet to see them from the air it is also hard to see for ourselves

111
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
Fence from the ground

112
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:57,119
Sometimes you see the let's say 15 meters away from you on the trail you're walking on

113
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,959
And they move 5m into the forest and you can't see them

114
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,775
Even though there are 3 ton animal that dance

115
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,359
It's tencent somehow they just disappear

116
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
Masters of camouflage

117
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
What's the elephant

118
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
That's right

119
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
Forest elephants are so hard

120
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,135
Account the best method they came up with was just walking around and Counting Forest elephant donkey

121
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,463
There is an estimate of how often does an elephant

122
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Poop

123
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:28,095
And how long does a pile of done last in the rainy season or in the dryer

124
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
Is super time-consuming

125
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
And pretty Limited

126
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
2 Peter wanted a new way

127
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Count these Alpha

128
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Any thoughts

129
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
Can't see them

130
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
And we can't

131
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Track them

132
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
What if we try to just

133
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Listen

134
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
If we

135
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
Know how often an elephant call

136
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,855
Then we can spread recorders over a big area

137
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:54,207
And record their vocalisations and use those numbers to count

138
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,303
This was my dear that was floated a long time ago by a scientist named

139
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Katie Payne

140
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:04,191
And the technology was reaching a point where maybe it was possible to conduct the kind of

141
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
Acoustic senses

142
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
Computers team decided

143
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
They were going to do

144
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
First Step was

145
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
To have 50 custom audio recorders

146
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,455
And they headed to the rainforest in central Africa

147
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
Every 5 square kilometer

148
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
They placed in audio

149
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
And where were the recorders

150
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Just go like

151
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Just put them on

152
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
Ground that gets stomped so we put

153
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Recorders

154
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,327
7 to 10 m up in a tree hanging from a tree limb seven-and-a-half to do them

155
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:37,983
That's 21 to 30 feet up in a tree out of the reach of an elephant up on its hind feet

156
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,079
Because they actually eat that way they the elephant might accidentally

157
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,383
Eat your audio recorder they have done that

158
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,455
Baby in your audio recorder well babe

159
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
They tasted that

160
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
Stuck at us through them

161
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Yeah

162
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,343
Peter and the team climbed

163
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
30 ft into the tree

164
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,951
And they strap these audio recorders in place and then

165
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,631
Peter could study these elephants long enough to know that

166
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
It could be days weeks even

167
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,543
Before an elephant would happen to wander By Any Given recorder and make that

168
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Elephant Rumble

169
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
The team just walked away

170
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
From these recorders

171
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
And they waited

172
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
And after 3 months

173
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
They went back into the forest

174
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,647
Backup the trees and the grab the memory cards

175
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Brought them out

176
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
The most important thing is you get back

177
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
The sound files

178
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,815
And listen to know that actually you have a recording

179
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
Did it actually record

180
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Exactly

181
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:43,007
Did it record when the first dated came back from this Forest

182
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,127
There is a lot of excitement because every rainforest sounds different

183
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,199
Insects calling frogs calling

184
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,527
The pounding on a tree buttressed by chimpanzee

185
00:08:54,783 --> 00:09:00,927
You have that on tape by accident so we have lots of them

186
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,255
But remember

187
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
Peter was listening for elephants

188
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
And specifically

189
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
For that different

190
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Kind of elephant

191
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
So they're going through hours

192
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
And how hours and hours of audio

193
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,111
Just like we got it Jurassic Park sound

194
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
Act like you can't believe that it's a real sound of Sun

195
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:37,279
Y'all know that's very true and if you have a speaker that can generate power

196
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
Shake your whole body

197
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,055
As soon as I hear it I'm visualizing this 3-ton beautiful animal

198
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
Wondering what is it doing when it's doing

199
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,735
But I think the next thing was actually kind of apprehension

200
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Because

201
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,343
50 recorders recording 24 hours a day for 3 months

202
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Save-A-Lot

203
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
Stuff to get for

204
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
It's a hundred

205
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
Thousand hours of audio

206
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,095
Oh but Peter just have a computer do it I can

207
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Can hear you thinking at home well

208
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,447
Listening to elephants is exactly

209
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,519
The kind of work that has been hard to Autumn

210
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,823
That's right it's a human labor story

211
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
After the break

212
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
Can we teach the robots

213
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663

I before we go on

221
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
We wanted to just take a quick

222
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
Door to knowledge that

223
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
A lot of elephants

224
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Good stories are

225
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
Like a little over simple

226
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,879
I got a real sense of this when I went to Malawi to try to see now that we ask you can we talk I was getting to talk

227
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,951
For this relatively new fence on the edge of a one-day National

228
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
The park when we ran into this local

229
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,047
Ass my name is videos

230
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
Shenzhen

231
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
Close by

232
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
My house is 15 meters

233
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Ephraim betta fish

234
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Before the fence

235
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
Were there elephants that came

236
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,567
Around your house

237
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Especially when they come through

238
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
A garden where there is food

239
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
We had problems

240
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
Problems because elephants are attracted to people's guard

241
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
Various is a school t

242
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,415
But like a lot of people on the edge of this park

243
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,511
He relies on his own garden and some nearby fields for his food

244
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
And if an elephant came to your garden

245
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,631
You could eat the entire Year's worth of crops

246
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Just a couple of hours

247
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,751
Do you have an experience with an elephant

248
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Fortunate that I'm not

249
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Cured

250
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
Human-elephant

251
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
That's what they're called

252
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
And the Really Danger

253
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,991
Curious remember this one horrible day

254
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
Before there was a fence

255
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
When an entire herd of

256
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
Prince kind of stampeded to his village

257
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
I did Iroquois

258
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
7 people

259
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
7 people Wednesday

260
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,095
Yes elephants are magical and incredible when you're a turret

261
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
But if you lived

262
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Next to a bunch of elephants

263
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
It's not really so incredible

264
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
And this dynamic

265
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
Contributes to the biggest threat facing

266
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Elephants

267
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Illegally killing elephants

268
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Poaching

269
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Are elephant research

270
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Peter rig

271
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,015
Says that the Smugglers and the international cartels running the ivory

272
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
What they'll do

273
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
Is it often find a local Africa

274
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,463
Chicken farmer not various but somebody who just had their crops destroyed by an elephant

275
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
Dell approach that person

276
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
To do the actual elephant

277
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:54,143
If someone comes in and says hey I heard you lost everything

278
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
Go kill that elephant

279
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
And I'll give you enough money to buy the food for your family

280
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
I don't

281
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,847
I don't really blame that guy who went out and did it

282
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Still

283
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,431
Peter is doing everything he can

284
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
How to stop

285
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Poaching

286
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
That's what this

287
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,295
Acoustic sentence with all about in the first

288
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
Tennis team ever courted months and months of rainforest audio

289
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
Sing elephants in rainforest sounds but if they went through the recordings they also had gunshot

290
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,775
I don't think we have any where you hear any elephant call or Screaming after the shots

291
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
Possibly because

292
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:38,687
Elephants are actually kind of too far away for the rumble to be heard or maybe they were instantly killed with

293
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
I doubt

294
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
But you know

295
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
Burst from AK47

296
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
Peter's team was going to count elephant sounds for this

297
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
Acoustic Forest elephant Center

298
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
They're also going to count gun show

299
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
This is the best proxy they had four

300
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
Poaching attempt

301
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Again

302
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,679
The problem was he had too much tape

303
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
50 recorders

304
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
Running for three straight

305
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,823
Months it would take a grad student

306
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,383
Listening to that 24 hours a day

307
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
6 years

308
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
To go through all of that audio

309
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
At Double speed

310
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
Peter needed a better man

311
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,087
You have I mean you can look at it with

312
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
The spectrograph

313
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
Spectrogram

314
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
This is where you turn sound into a

315
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,999
And if you've seen this it's like a ghostly picture of sound

316
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,095
If you looked at enough elephant sound

317
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
You could learn to recognize

318
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
So the first way to try to

319
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,031
The count elephant calls is to have a human being sitting for

320
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Pewter

321
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,127
And then like I said of really weird flashcards

322
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,199
Apopka picture of like a minute of rainforest

323
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
And then another and then another

324
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,879
And that just flashes flashes flashes flashes and you're looking for that elephant call in there

325
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,023
So that's founder that's good it's faster but doing that with one day of sound

326
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
Takes about 20 or 25 minutes

327
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Not

328
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Super

329
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Efficient

330
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,959
Ideally you train a computer to do this for you

331
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
And that's what Peters team tried to do

332
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,127
But this is exactly the kind of human labor it's been really hard to replace

333
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
Peter's team had to describe to a computer

334
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,247
What a picture of an elephant called

335
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,855
But each one is like a little different and sometimes there's a weird looking one that

336
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,159
You know human would be able to point out but then how do you

337
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
Tell computer to

338
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
Define those ones in

339
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,511
Two Peters team ended up with

340
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
With this like detector program

341
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,863
It had a really broad parameters

342
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Of what it would look

343
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,751
So it's fine signals that aren't actually elephants and we have to sort through that

344
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,079
Time-consuming very time-consuming not an ideal

345
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Luckily for pewter

346
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,223
Another animal researcher had run into this exact same

347
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
Let's get this party started

348
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
Let's do it

349
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
Matt McKeown

350
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
Started as a bird rio

351
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,927
As part of my PhD work I was collecting

352
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,487
A ton of recording acoustic recordings

353
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
You know sitting on mountain tops with tape recorders

354
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
And and then I started to

355
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,679
Text bar how I can collect more data

356
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
Just like Peter rig

357
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
That was pretty quickly swamped by the volume of recordings he created and to some degree this is like the modern

358
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Problem Ark

359
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
Ability to record data

360
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
Of all kind

361
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
Has outpaced our ability to make sense of

362
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,367
This is what people mean when they talk about the era of Big Data

363
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,183
A huge part of the tech economy now

364
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:34,815
Are companies that are just trying to come up with ways to get through all the stuff that we can now collect digital

365
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
Somat started looking around for solution

366
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
He found

367
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,727
The buzziest of all Silicon Valley Buzz phrases

368
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
The neural net

369
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Talk about neural networks

370
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
Explain what those are pretend I'm a 3rd grader

371
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,919
Well you know basically what it is it's its

372
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
A system that's kind of

373
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
Based loosely

374
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,575
On the connectivity patterns of neurons in the human brain

375
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
Right right so

376
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
There is

377
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
A lot of really complicated math

378
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
Going on inside oven door

379
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
So complicated

380
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,327
In fact the computers couldn't handle it until relatively recently

381
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
But

382
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:14,495
We're going to do our imperfect best right now to just give you a sense of what is actually going on inside of it

383
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,055
Let's say you want to show a computer

384
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
And how to tell you

385
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Dog

386
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Not.

387
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:21,919
That is

388
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,991
Really easy for a human being to do but it's really hard

389
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,575
To write a set of rules for a computer to identify a dog

390
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Get to be like

391
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,903
You know it's like a dog I don't know it's like

392
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
List all user

393
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
It's fluffy

394
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,279
But but I mean not always I don't know it's it is just too much to have

395
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,351
So the idea behind a neural network is

396
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,191
It's a computer program where you don't have to explain everything

397
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,519
But in order to make that program work

398
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,823
You have to give your neural network

399
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
A bunch of pictures and say

400
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,383
This dog

401
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,663
This. Dog

402
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,527
Yes you're showing it pictures with a dog and without a dog and telling it which is which

403
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,343
What is happening each time this

404
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
Program looks at a picture

405
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,207
Is it you got this first layer of what people call neurons

406
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
These are metaphorical now

407
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,351
But each of these neurons is going to focus on some general facet

408
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
Of the doggy

409
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
So imagine there's one neuron

410
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
It's looking at these and thinking like

411
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,799
You know when there is a dog I'm seeing like a lot of

412
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
Round a lot of the time

413
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
Well I'm noticing a lot of Curves in these

414
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,455
Ignorant they start to learn you know like

415
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,735
I see Brown

416
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
Then they are going to light up

417
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,599
I'm in the later layers metaphorical neurons

418
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Refine the analysis

419
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Oh hey look

420
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,207
I got like a tail like a

421
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
The tale

422
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,535
Something over here next time these neuron see that stuff

423
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,327
They're also going to light up as well

424
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
And this whole process is

425
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
Cumulative the idea is that

426
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Dogness

427
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,471
Become so decentralized

428
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
In this network

429
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
Work that no matter what

430
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Picture you show it

431
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,615
If it's a dog you're going to get some combination of neurons

432
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Lighting up

433
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
And being like yeah

434
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
This is a dog

435
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
Again

436
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
To train the network

437
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,319
You have to give it tons and tons of pictures and say

438
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
This dog

439
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
This not.

440
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,183
And with each new picture of dog

441
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
The program teaches

442
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,767
Is itself a little more about dogness

443
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
It starts to hone in on the TV

444
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,887
Tiny traits of dogness that are most important

445
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
To look for and the network is almost certainly going to

446
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,495
Find ways to identify a dog

447
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,519
That we humans

448
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Wouldn't have even

449
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
Pot to tell the computer

450
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
Computer to look for in

451
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
In the first place

452
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,943
This is what people mean when they say machine

453
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,247
Learning this whole field is called Deep

454
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:38,111
Learning because of the Advent of modern computer technology

455
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,695
You can make these neural networks that have many many layers

456
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Of neurons

457
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,559
And so you can start to recognize real fine scale patterns

458
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Matt McKeown

459
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
Ended up starting a company

460
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,423
Need to help researchers like Peter Rabbit

461
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,471
Set up their own neural network

462
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
To dig through there

463
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,079
And his company is now working with Peter and the Elephant listening

464
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Project

465
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,615
To deal

466
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
With all that rain

467
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
By the way this works is

468
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
Is the Peter Rags rainforest

469
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
Turned into those specs

470
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Sound

471
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:16,255
And then Matt McKeown is training a neural network to go through every single rainforest sound and say

472
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
Elephant sound

473
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
Not elephants

474
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
So

475
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:25,471
50 recorders three-month Siege over a hundred thousand hours of audio

476
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,311
Matt says his neural network will be able to get through all of that

477
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
In Just 4 hours

478
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Just 4 hours

479
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
Count up all of the

480
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,967
It sounds so Peter can finally know

481
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,807
How many Forest elephants are there and where are they

482
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
It may be hard to

483
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,647
Tell a computer exactly what to look for

484
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
A neural network and learn

485
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
To look

486
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
For this

487
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:58,751
That actually is

488
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
A fantastic example of

489
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,847
Two females who are

490
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,919
Performing what we call a greeting ceremony

491
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Again

492
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,223
Peter Rag and he says

493
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
These Rumbles

494
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
These are a perfect example

495
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
Of elephant

496
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Language

497
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,623
They've heard this pattern before when

498
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,208
Elephants have been separated for some time and then they come together to like

499
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:18,976
Wechat

500
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,608
I think it's very much like

501
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,960
If you run into a friend on the street you know that you haven't seen for a while

502
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:35,616
It's a back-and-forth 100 how are you and all I'm okay what about you though it's not so good I've lost my jaw

503
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
Oh my God

504
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,224
Who knows what they're really saying but it's that

505
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,600
Perhaps that kind of thing

506
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:52,256
Computer set out to do this audio sensors that neural network was still be

507
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
And today it's still being true

508
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
They're still showing at tons of elephant column

509
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,424
Yeah it takes a long time

510
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,216
So for the first round of data

511
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,544
Peter went ahead and use the old school method

512
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,616
Telling the computer what an elephant call looks like

513
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:08,896
And yes

514
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
What's precise

515
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
Or labor

516
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
But it worked

517
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,528
Any idea as a whole

518
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,808
Recording for a selfie

519
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
2 track for sale

520
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,184
Peter's team was able to find all those elephants

521
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
Play some on a map

522
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,768
Figure out what time it happened

523
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
And if you imagine like a TV weather map

524
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
Instead of rolling clouds

525
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Esl

526
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,448
Is the kind of thing you need

527
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,752
To make anti-poaching teams is effective

528
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:40,128
You can say okay we know that elephants are not using this huge part of this park

529
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,664
For these 7 months

530
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:46,528
We don't need to send any other coaching teams they are because no poachers are going to find an elephant anyway

531
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
And you can see

532
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,112
Where the population of elephants

533
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,440
Does moving across the landscape at different times of year

534
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,816
Cool no one has ever known that for any elephant of any

535
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
Species anywhere

536
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,400
This has Peter excited

537
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
When is neural network

538
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,728
Really trains up

539
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,288
That's when the possibilities really get go

540
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,824
A neural network

541
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
Would move

542
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Wayfast

543
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,640
Anyway morak

544
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,920
And you can imagine

545
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,712
Dish Network learning to hear

546
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,992
Kinds of elf

547
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
Like when it's a distress call

548
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832
Maybe some other sign of

549
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
And

550
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
We have

551
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,464
Two gunshots here or we have AK-47

552
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Gunshots here

553
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
If I can be fed out of the rainforest

554
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,328
