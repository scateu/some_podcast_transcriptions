A common set of rules about Trey

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
And if anyone broke those rules

62
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
They would have to immediately report to a lake

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088

It's like the United Nations for trade

68
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
And like the United Nations

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560

70
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376

Today on the show we asked

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,448
Big question

74
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,824
Should the WTO be able to veto a decision made by the elected representatives of the American people

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,688
Does it have the power to stop a trade War

76

Geneva Switzerland

89
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
The headquarters of the WTO

90
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
If the speed

91
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,344
Classical looking office building right on the shore of Lake Geneva

92
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,648
Sun pours into his big windows

93
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
And a letter arrives

94
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
From the country of Indonesia

95
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:49,632
This is the first volley in the great dispute of Indonesia versus the United States

96
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
Loathe versus men

97
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
Savory versus refreshing

98
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,776
Don't listen to him kids don't smoke

99
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,872
The letter says we formerly called BS on this whole flavors

100
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Cigarette ban

101
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
You have Des

102
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,248
Discriminated against our clove cigarettes in violation

103
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
Of article 2.1

104
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
The technical barriers

105
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
To trade agreement

106
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
It's part of the Marrakesh agreement

107
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,208
We all agreed on that remember all of us green

108
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
AmeriCash in America

109
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
The WTO is both in organized

110
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:23,679
Station and any idea if they have a building with employees they all call themselves The

111
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
Crateria twitch

112
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
It's just a fancy word for staff

113
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Really it's much

114
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Bigger than that

115
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
The WTO is a bunch of countries that

116
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
Promise to follow

117
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Rule

118
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,735
They're about 60 agreement total but the main Prince

119
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
Boils down to

120
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
What is good for me

121
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
Has to be good

122
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
For you

123
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
We the countries to trade

124
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Cannot screw each other over

125
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,023
And the WTO will help us enforce these rules against each other

126
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,583
Process of figuring out who screwed who can take

127
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,655
So what we can do right now is compressed

128
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
The whole drama

129
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Clove vs. mint

130
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
Into just a few min

131
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
Step one in a trade dispute

132
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
The private

133
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Meeting

134
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
The two disputing countries have

135
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,991
Tuck it out on their own any secure room works

136
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,807
It doesn't have to be in Geneva there just has to be a table

137
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Actually

138
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
Pretty big table

139
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,927
They come with the lawyers and their brief

140
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:23,327
And if it already try that have racial yours in that pool that have a portal yours

141
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,935
That Pascal Lamy he's French during clothes

142
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
So I'm looking at this

143
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Case between

144
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,103
2010 and 2014 about clove cigarettes

145
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
Do you remember this case

146
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Of course I do

147
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,759
And he says the first meeting is like any negotiation

148
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Except

149
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,855
Except they're quite productive the translation going on

150
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
The WTO

151
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
Works in

152
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
French

153
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
English

154
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Fewest walks in and says

155
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
We're Banning flavored smoke

156
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
To protect

157
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
The kid

158
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
And I'm sure some countries would love to have a bunch of twelve-year-olds smoking the clove cigarettes Indonesia but we'd

159
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
And Indonesia is like

160
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
Oh really you

161
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
Care about the kids then why are you still allowing a candy cane flavored cigarettes

162
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
It's menthol

163
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Edit palette

164
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,183
It's a flavor and kids in the US are smoking menthols to

165
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,535
No you're just protecting your own us tobacco companies and

166
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Punishing the rest

167
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,119
To the world no no no no no this is not

168
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
About for inverse

169
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
Domestic product

170
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
We never mentioned

171
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
Any other country

172
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,871
Labor Day we are allowed to do that

173
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Stalemate

174
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,527
Indonesian the United States they don't agree in that private

175
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,367
That's okay there's a bunch of steps next one step two

176
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
Bring in the air

177
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,767
Do usn Indonesia have to agree on 3 outside experts that usually diplomats

178
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
Former diplomats

179
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,119
And these three outside experts they are going to decide

180
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
Whether the US has violated in international trade

181
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
And the drama moves

182
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
To the headquarters of the WTO

183
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
I've been there before the whole place

184
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
She's kind of a trip it has all these

185
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
Old

186
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
Gorgeous murals

187
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,271
Workers on the wall and ornate ceilings and light fixtures but then it has all the

188
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
Funky modern European furniture in little

189
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Little teacups

190
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
Everyone does have good coffee there

191
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
It is

192
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Excellent coffee

193
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,839
Okay will bees experts they go into one of these fancy rooms with a good coffee and now even more lawyer show

194
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
This time with

195
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Cartloads

196
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Of paperwork

197
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:39,519
No it's just you know these people

198
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
You know that

199
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
Lawyers video by the timer

200
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
All by the page

201
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
Because a page is a Time

202
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,063
So the longer the bigger

203
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
The more money they make

204
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,743
And it's not just the United States and Indonesia in the room now now every other country that also stands to win or lose

205
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Who is over the

206
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,607
US ban on flavored cigarettes their meeting with a panel to

207
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:10,239
Brazil they say we agree with Indonesia this Special Rule unjustifiably

208
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
Discriminates against imported cigarettes

209
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,895
And here are a bunch of past trade disputes to prove it

210
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
Turkey says

211
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,015
I don't know panel of experts first you have to tell us whether mint cigarettes

212
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,807
Are in fact the same product

213
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
S clips

214
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
And Guatemala is like

215
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,695
This distinction has too many ramifications for our country

216
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
We're not going to take

217
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Take a side

218
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:36,351
But allow us to explain all the reasons why we think this case is so,

219
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
You can see why this process takes

220
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
So long

221
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
A year-and-a-half

222
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
Later the panel of experts releases

223
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
A 190 page

224
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,663
Report and there are many fine points in there the panel decides that the United States

225
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
She's right

226
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
About flavored sake

227
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,063
But they also say that the United States

228
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,367
Is giving special treatment to its

229
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
Menthol cigarettes it is

230
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
Discriminating against an Indonesian product

231
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Fine

232
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
United States appeals the decision

233
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
Countries almost always appeal

234
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,423
So the final decision will be up to what is essentially the

235
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
Supreme Court

236
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
It's called the Appellate body

237
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Body made up of

238
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Actual

239
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
Changes although apparently they don't look like

240
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
Do you wear robes

241
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
No

242
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Anor

243
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Does your body work

244
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:31,903
James Backus is one of the original Seven judges at the World Trade Organization the way you are described to me

245
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Was

246
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
As like

247
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,255
The grandfather of

248
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
The WTO appellate judges

249
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:46,751
Comforting father to grandfather talk to be brother Young

250
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
1995 Ford

251
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
Search up

252
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Parole

253
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:55,711
Bacchus is American he was commuting from his home in Orlando Florida to

254
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
To Geneva

255
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
The judge job

256
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Is a part-time

257
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183
Becca says they all have to shed their nationalities at the door they represent the whole world

258
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Now

259
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
And I can't talk

260
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
2NE1

261
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,327
We refrain from dinners cocktail parties or

262
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
Anything of that sort

263
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,959
How to descent we socialize we socialized among ourselves

264
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,055
For the first few years the judges don't even go to the WTO cafeteria

265
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Feel like monks

266
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Which they had to

267
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
The stakes are very high

268
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
Whatever these judges decide affect

269
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
Trillions of dollars of trade

270
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
The clovers mint case went before the judges

271
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,087
In 2012

272
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
It is not a trial

273
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
3

274
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,463
Lonely Robles judges meeting in a room

275
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,791
Going over all the oral and written testimony from the earlier expert

276
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,559
Propel

277
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
And they deliberate

278
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,655
The cigarette world is holding its breath

279
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:52,031
And the judges side with the original Three

280
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Spurts the US

281
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Loses

282
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Time for puns

283
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,431
The WTO has what I call

284
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
The rule of the

285
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,575
The country hits its neighbor unfairly then that country is allowed to hit it back

286
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:10,719
The WTO gives countries permission to punish other countries we're talking money

287
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
Either cut us a check or

288
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
We get to slap rich

289
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Retaliatory tariff

290
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
To hurt you as much as

291
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
You hurt us

292
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,959
Indonesia says the ban on flavors custom million

293
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,543
So they wanted 42 million dollars back

294
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,567
From the United States

295
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,615
Every year the law is in effect

296
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
And then

297
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
The whole thing just sort of fizzled out

298
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
Indonesian United States reach a secret settle

299
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
And US says

300
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
We're going to keep our ban on flavored C

301
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,951
Cigarettes and Indonesia at this point has found

302
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
I work around

303
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
Cigars

304
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
They start sending

305
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Cigars

306
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
Chinese

307
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
Cigarette looking clove cigars

308
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,471
That's why we all still smell cloves on the

309
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
I feel a little bit

310
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,151
Bad about this anticlimax

311
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
Ending to our big

312
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Well

313
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,087
Welcome to the WTO anti-climactic is our motto this is how a lot of cases end

314
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
Everybody get that thanks for participating

315
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
Participation Trophy and then they go up

316
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,047
But this is the thing about the WTO no one country is willing to fight

317
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
To the death over this because

318
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Countries

319
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,679
Want to resolve their trade disputes they want to

320
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
Trading with you

321
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,799
So in this case I mean even though the two sides fought like hell over

322
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Flavored cigarette

323
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,639
In the long-term there are bigger issues out

324
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
United States wants to sell

325
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
Very expensive technology

326
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,271
Indonesia

327
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Textile industry in Watts

328
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
To sell that to the United States

329
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
And so if you look in the long-term

330
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
It is in everyone's best interest

331
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
To compromise

332
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
Or at least it was

333
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:57,215
After the break what happens when the largest economy in the world besides

334
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
It's had enough of this whole

335
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Compromising

336
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:10,015
This week on the indicator the Supreme Court just legalized sports betting and some people are worried about rampant

337
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Game fixing

338
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
But it turns out

339
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,135
Legal bookmakers have a way of keeping people on it

340
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
Phenol

341
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
Watched people betting and they were able to trace it back to some players indicator from Planet Money shorts

342
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
Story about the economy

343
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Every single day

00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,471

Donald Trump was elected

351
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
You may have heard

352
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,007
He does not see the subtlety and the beauty of the WTO like you

353
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
You do Sarah

354
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
Official sporange I just

355
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
Has ruled against

356
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
United States

357
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
He says quote

358
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
The WTO

359
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
Has been a disaster

360
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
To be clear free trade has actually benefited the United States and the United States has won most of the case

361
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Is that it has brought

362
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,511
The WTO does not matter the Trump Administration decides not to

363
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Fight back

364
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
These other countries on trade

365
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,399
It decides it's going to go after

366
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
The WTO

367
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Itself

368
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,287
So we called up the guy running the WTO Roberto Azevedo

369
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Ask him the most

370
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
Pressing question of our time

371
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
Director-general

372
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,687
Is mint

373
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
A flavor

374
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Well

375
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,575
The first thing I should make clear is that as Direct

376
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
Dollar General

377
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
I cannot comment

378
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
On specific

379
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,719
Disputes you can't even say whether meant to the flavor or not

380
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,047
I can tell you my preferences

381
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
I love them in

382
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Chewing gum for

383
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
Things like that

384
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Okay I'll take it

385
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Bruce Lee

386
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
If you are striking at the very heart of the w

387
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
Remember those judges

388
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
We talked about

389
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:15,199
The ones who are sitting alone in the cafeteria

390
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
Have to agree on who those judges are

391
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,087
And countries haven't always they vetoed the nominations

392
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Guy just before said

393
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:27,743
This person let's start the whole process over and find a judge we can all agree on

394
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,839
But under the Trump Administration the US is preventing any new judges

395
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
From even being considered

396
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
What we see now is different

397
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
It's not about

398
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Disagreeing with the outcome

399
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
It is about not allowing

400
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
The process to

401
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
That is impressive

402
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,431
And there's nothing the WTO can do about it

403
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
So we don't even begin to look at

404
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
Received the names of the Kennedy

405
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
The process was

406
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Launched

407
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
Which have two handed

408
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Can I see something pretty

409
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
Clever way

410
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,535
Just slow down the work of the WTO right now there are four judges

411
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
Two are on their way out

412
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
When it goes to two

413
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
Then at that point in time

414
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
The appeals process is

415
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Play paralyzed

416
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
Are you concerned about that

417
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Absolutely

418
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,639
It seems like a lot of the reason why countries

419
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
Play by the rules is just

420
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
Kind of like out of respect

421
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,295
For the Norms of the WTO

422
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
What happens if a country

423
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Goes Rogue

424
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,719
Says you know we're not going to follow the rules that have historically been followed

425
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
So it will compromise the system

426
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Pusher

427
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
If we don't all

428
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
Try

429
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
2

430
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
Observe the district

431
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
Placenta results

432
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Dudes

433
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,007
And in the system.

434
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
Sum function

435
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
I think sometimes the WTO is

436
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Portrayed

437
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
As this Boogeyman have all of this

438
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Power

439
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,015
But it really it's a pretty fragile system that takes a lot of

440
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,087
Agreement among its members to get anything done

441
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,951
Like there's no enforcement it's really just countries promising to be nice to one another

442
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,511
We contacted the US trade representative

443
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
Office in the Trump Administration to ask about the news

444
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
And they said that they have some

445
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
Problem

446
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,519
With some of the technical ways in which the WTO is handling the judge situation

447
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Those are resolved

448
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
They're not going to prove anymore

449
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Okay but there's one thing I want to get him here

450
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Yes

451
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,991
The US is making things difficult for the WTO there

452
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
Screaming at the referees on the soccer

453
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
The US

454
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,903
Is still on the field they are still

455
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
Playing against other countries

456
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,231
The United States itself

457
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Bring in disputes

458
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
To the system even though

459
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
Demonstration

460
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
Soap

461
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,423
Why bring a dispute to the system if

462
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
You don't want to

463
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
To observe this is

464
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
Want the system at all

465
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
So you're saying

466
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:55,199
Under the Trump Administration the United States is coming to the WTO and making claims against other countries

467
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
I'm not saying that

468
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
What is a

469
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
I feel the same

470
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
WTO can't live with it

471
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,927
Cat Crusher trade opponents without it

472
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Robert just a warning

473
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
I think we might have to do this whole process all over again

474
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,119
Food and Drug Administration under Trump

475
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
Steve just announced that

476
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,959
They're ready to start considering a ban on

477
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:21,055
All of the flavors including cigars and E-cigarettes

478
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Even

479
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,103
Menthol

I highly told breathing I thought they needed

488
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
PTY

489
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Like disease

Okay wait

492
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
Do we promote cigarettes

493
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,647
I don't know I kind of feel like going to be today

494
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
You should we should play out one of those ads for

495
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
Yeah

496
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Cuz I really

497
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Cool lights

498
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,071
Smoking ain't cool ads
