00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,584
One of our producers here at Planet Money Elizabeth

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,144
Recently moved here from Australia

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,192
And last week she got kind of

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,240
Initiation into American

5
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,544
She did her tax

6
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,848
At first she and her husband Matthew

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Do you harden try to do

8
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
Do it on their own

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,968
And the Texas kind of took over their part

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,760
On our

11
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,552
Dining room table

12
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,600
We have a pile of

13
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
WW2

14
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,184
V 1099

15
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,768
Anime some other forms like a 1095-c

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,584
Elizabeth and Matthew realized they were going to need some

17
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
So they hired an account

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,472
It could easily be $500 a weekend to spend at the accountant

19
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:47,104
What did Mayweather you say to me the other day you would be happy if was less than $1,000 that she's

20
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,664
This is all kind of blowing there

21
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,456
Because there is nothing

22
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
Like this in Australia

23
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
In Australia paying taxes is really fast and easy

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,672
In fact Elizabeth the math you couldn't even tell me when Australian tax day what

25
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,488
So is there an equivalent of

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,512
April 5th

27
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
Teens

28
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
In Australia

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
Really

30
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
Know that means yeah

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,936
I don't remember being such a thing

32
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
I think it's like February or March

33
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:20,896
It's October 31st actually but in most of the rest of the world they don't know when tax day is either

34
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,944
All of the crazy stress around

35
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,576
24-hour hotlines that software the accordion folders full of receipts the lines down the street

36
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
H&R Block

37
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,624
That is

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
Pretty much just a USA thing

39
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,512
So we have it the worst our taxes are the

40
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Worst

41
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Taxes

42
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
I filing system is the worst

43
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
Flick of objectively

44
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
Yeah objectively

45
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
Joseph bankman is a professor of

46
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
Tax Lots

47
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
And he says collectively

48
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
We spend billions of dollars

49
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,944
And billions of hours every year filing our taxes

50
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
Not to mention the emotional

51
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,808
Induces it does not have to be this way

52
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,112
In most of the world it's not

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
And Joe

54
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
Use exactly how to fix this

55
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352

To believe the paint taxes does not need to be so difficult

Goes on a year-long quest to make filing taxes easier for everyone

61
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,600
And you might be wondering who would want to keep taxes complicated

00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
I will tell you who

63
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
A multibillion-dollar corporation

64
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,744
And one of the most important

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Power Brokers in Washington

66
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:46,912

Whether you're buying your first car

71
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
Moving out on your own getting married having your first child or seeing your children move out on their own

72
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736

You can count on your State Farm agent for a wide range of solutions expertise and support

Here to help life go right

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,632
So Alex jumping bean does not look like your typical

78
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,192
Warrior hero what's the best way to

79
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,568
When Steven Spielberg inevitably directs a Blockbuster movie about taxes

80
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
Joe bankman will be played by Tom Hanks

81
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,224
Mind you it's a Tom Hanks who's been teaching tax lot Stanford

82
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,808
Also Avery dressed down Tom Hanks

83
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Alex when we talked to Joe Banks

84
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,672
Been at Stanford you were marked nobody was very dressed

85
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
Joe and I are both pretty casual

86
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
I suppose Alex is being very sweet but as I look at these Sarah slack I notice

87
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,728
There is a stain on one of them

88
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
And

89
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
The Cuffs are frayed

90
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
I hate taxes

91
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,920
But you'll bankman

92
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
Love's tax

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,320
Joe loves taxes so much that he thinks about them in his spare time

94
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
In fact

95
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,672
He spent time when he's not in class or on campus

96
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
Helping the state of California wear contacts

97
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
If back in 2003 Joe is part of the

98
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,887
Little team that was working with the state that help take down taxes

99
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:28,543
We are just done a bill to penalize a form of tax shelter

100
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
And it raised a lot of money for this day

101
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:36,479
And we're all out to lunch at a mediocre restaurant in Sacramento

102
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
Yeah we are celebrating

103
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
Joey his California tax

104
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,367
MRP eating lunch and Talking Shop

105
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
And they told you they have the

106
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,231
And I did I think would save California

107
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,047
A bunch of money and time and help

108
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
Most people in California

109
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
I have really simple

110
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
All of their income from a regular

111
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
And taxes are already withheld

112
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
From the paychecks

113
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,591
So their idea was why don't we start off

114
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
Giving them a tax return

115
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,479
That's already filled out with the income we know they have

116
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
And then they can make Corrections

117
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
That was their idea

118
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,927
Basically the government would send you a tax return that was already filled out

119
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
It would include all of the income that the state knew about all this

120
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
Taxes that had already been withheld for

121
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
Paychex

122
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,607
And you would look it over and

123
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Build it

124
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,191
Joni this was how taxes work in most countries

125
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Towers in Europe

126
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Parts of Asia

127
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,543
Scandinavia Australia

128
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
And so he thought

129
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Why not here

130
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,895
The way I think of it is

131
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,199
Imagine if the credit card come

132
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
Acted like the IRS

133
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,599
Each month you get a Visa bill and be a blank piece of paper

134
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,415
And you'd have to write down all of your perch

135
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,951
She says and add it up

136
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
And if you did it wrong you face a penalty

137
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
So the IRS could

138
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Act like Visa

139
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,959
And paying taxes would be like paying a credit

140
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,543
And we could be like Elizabeth and Matthew are first-time taxpayer

141
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
Not know when our tax day is

142
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
So now Joe and his team had decided

143
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,295
But they still needed to make it real bad to figure out what this form would be

144
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
BN what it would look

145
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,879
And so Alice we have it we have it right

146
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,719
Do not look like a tax form I've ever seen

147
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:29,119
Yeah you know it's it's just one page it looks pretty friendly it's not a bunch of legalese you know it says

148
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Easy as 1 2 3

149
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,519
Step 1 review return step to make any changes in step 3 send it back

150
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,103
That's it I know there's something so friendly about it at the top of the

151
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
Filing your taxes just got easier

152
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
And then has the name that Joe and his

153
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,039
Team gave to this form and enter this whole project

154
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
We called it a ready writer

155
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,135
I like ready return it snappy

156
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
It's snap you sent it

157
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,023
Now Joe and his California tax team have this form

158
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,559
Ready to spray friendly form

159
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,631
Ready return is actually going to work

160
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
If taxpayers

161
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
Use it if they would like it

162
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
Submitted a pilot program in California

163
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,591
In the 2004 tax season isn't ready returns out to get 11,000 tax

164
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
Along with this

165
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
Little survey

166
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
So we ask people

167
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,759
Do you think you'd like to use this again next

168
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,343
And 99% of the people said yes

169
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,671
99% of people don't say yes to anything

170
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
90% of 20

171
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Beijing

172
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,815
I talked to someone else who's involved in ready return and what he told me is

173
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
When you work in government nothing

174
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
That's reviews like that he's a

175
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,751
You don't get 99% satisfaction rates with the polio vaccine it's just unheard of

176
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
Probably true

177
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,103
And it wasn't just the survey either the things I was actually

178
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
Proudest over there

179
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
The comments

180
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
The people had written in on their survey

181
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,759
And he actually brought a stack of

182
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
Please print it out comments in to talk with us

183
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
What I do

184
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
Is a rifle through some of the pages

185
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,487
And then I asked people to tell me when to stop

186
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,071
Because I don't want anybody think I'm cherry-picking so tell me

187
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
Here are Alex can see me

188
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,983
Tell me when to stop flipping through the pages and I will tell him to stop right now

189
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,799
Okay cuz on a random page on some random

190
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,127
And the first one thank you for allowing me to participate

191
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
Second this was very easy and convenient

192
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
3rd

193
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
No problems I loved it

194
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
So I said I loved it

195
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
I loved it

196
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,695
Here's one that says PS is the same service available for federal tax

197
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
Returns this is all cap

198
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,095
Add someone used all caps positive

199
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Yes

200
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,935
There was one comment that really stuck with

201
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,031
Finally government's doing something to make my life better

202
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
What did you think when you read that

203
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:51,967
I was really touched them and I was really moved I'm even moved as I think about it now

204
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,295
For someone like me that's your your dream right

205
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,111
You know if you think about filing taxes he

206
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,487
It's one of the most important interactions you've got with your government

207
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
And how does it make you feel

208
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
It makes you pissed

209
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,935
You can understand that you're anxious you're worried about screwing up

210
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
And

211
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,335
We make 160 million people go through this each year that's

212
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
That's really bad

213
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Did you think that

214
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
If we can prove that.

215
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
Did you think it would like help improve

216
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
People's relationship with the government

217
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Absolutely

218
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Joe thought his little

219
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
Ready return form

220
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
Damiki big

221
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Difference

222
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
In the country

223
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,279
Of course the first ready return had to pass

224
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
The California state legislature in Sacramento

225
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,935
But you wasn't that worried I mean everyone who tried ready return had loved

226
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,519
And California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was also on board

227
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,383
So just started making the two hour car trip from Stanford to Sacramento every week

228
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
To talk with lettuce

229
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
Well I thought

230
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
That if I just talked

231
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
I was kind of naive I thought well I get it

232
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
That

233
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:08,511
People are conservative or a liberal but since this is a nonpartisan issue

234
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
I'll just

235
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,095
Talk to all of our representative

236
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
UPS in Sacramento and explain things

237
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,215
I'm a talker I thought I could do that

238
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Choza Taqueria

239
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,079
He is a talker and he he made a list of all the legend

240
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
Slater's would be voting on ready

241
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,199
Return any just started calling at their offices and asking for meeting

242
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,015
I wasn't getting enough meetings

243
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,111
People would put me off or they say we'll get back to you

244
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
And even when Joe did get a meeting

245
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
$10 go so well

246
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
Well one meeting

247
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,071
Somebody said I've been warned about you

248
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,167
Yeah that was that at startup with what did they mean

249
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,519
They mad that the Intuit lobbyists it already been in

250
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Intuit

251
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
Is the company that owns

252
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
TurboTax

253
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:01,247
TurboTax is of course the very popular tax preparation software it is a multi-billion Dollar business

254
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,367
A multibillion-dollar business that was now staring down the barrel of Jose ready return

255
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
And if you look at this from TurboTax is point of view

256
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,023
This is not good I mean ready which one is all about making

257
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
Taxes easier

258
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,191
And if your taxes are easier you're a whole lot less likely to spend a hundred bucks on tax prep

259
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Software

260
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,311
So just started hearing that into it without asking around about her

261
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
His plan

262
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:31,711
Which of these little talks you know for legislators about ready return he given academic talk for students

263
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
Professors

264
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
He started noticing something odd

265
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
Whenever he gave a talk

266
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
He would always notice someone from Intuit

267
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
In the crowd

268
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,743
They would show up at talks I would give

269
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
How would you know that it was that

270
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,583
I give a lot of talk

271
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:54,239
And I'm only going to get it like 10:30 people and everybody looks like an academic but one woman comes in

272
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,543
I just kind of looking a little corporate

273
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
She's like dressed better than the rest

274
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,991
And so that's a tip off right away tax academics or not the best dressed people in the world

275
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,599
Intuited want to talk to us for this piece but they sent us a statement

276
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,927
It said that they have long advocated for tax simplification

277
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,511
But they're ready return quote minimizes taxpayer engagement

278
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
They think that's bad

279
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,887
Who discovered the into it had been very busy in Sac

280
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,447
Meeting with politicians giving money

281
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,519
Intuit gave $1000000 to a pack.

282
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,079
Supported one of the key politicians on the ready return issue

283
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,175
This kind of thing happens all the time we have a little group it is

284
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
Very invested in an issue

285
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
A lot of people

286
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,551
Give me the little group in this case TurboTax

287
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,391
Is willing to spend tons of time and tons of money making some

288
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Happen

289
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,511
And the large group of people that might benefit a little bit or not willing to spend that time in May

290
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
Prince's I would love it if filing my taxes

291
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Easier but

292
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,191
I haven't called my congressman I'm not really willing to spend a whole bunch of money to make that happen

293
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Then again

294
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
I am Nacho

295
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
So that's

296
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,383
The point where I decided to hire my own Lobby

297
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,991
I've never even heard of someone hiring their own lobbyists

298
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
It was really fun I really enjoyed hiring a lot

299
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
I hired a guy named Mike Robson

300
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
Coart smart as a whip

301
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Really likeable

302
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,815
Kind of looks like a more svelte

303
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,863
James Gandolfini

304
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
But that lobbyists

305
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
He didn't come cheap

306
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
How much did that cost

307
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,823
They gave me a deal because they thought it would be kind of

308
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Fun

309
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
The work for this

310
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,455
Craze Professor working for you

311
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Yeah

312
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,039
They're working for me and so

313
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,391
The normal price I think would have been $140,000 to

314
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
To get Mike services

315
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,487
But he gave it to me for only

316
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,767
35

317
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,559
Should I pay 35000

318
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
Wake of your own money

319
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Of my own money

320
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Liquor savings

321
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
Yeah why did you spend the money that way

322
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,359
I know I felt lucky again to be able to do as a great cause

323
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,455
And everybody I think has some causes that think they're good causes and

324
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:16,319
This was a cause that was really good and nobody else was going to do it but

325
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
Making that investment hiring Mike

326
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
It paid off

327
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
With microbes and everybody would talk

328
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Why

329
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
Well they had relationships with him

330
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
Legislators

331
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,935
Kind of like that I was with Mike

332
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,495
Because they also kind of legitimated

333
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,335
They figure if you're with Mike you're probably

334
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
Sensible

335
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,431
You probably are going to get good information

336
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,783
If I have a question I can call your lobbyist if I can't get ahold of you

337
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,087
The meeting start to go a little better

338
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
Legislator start listening to Joe

339
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Telling him

340
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
You got my vote

341
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
But Joe says

342
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
He noticed

343
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
It was hard to get Republicans to back ready

344
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
It wasn't just into it or campaign money

345
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
It had to do

346
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
With a pledge

347
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
And privately I should say

348
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:11,103
A lot of Republicans told me what this just sounds like a no-brainer I just can't do it

349
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
Because

350
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
Grover norquist is supposed to

351
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,015
Hello my name is Grover norquist

352
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
I am the President

353
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
Of Americans

354
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
For tax

355
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,415
Perform we fight for taxpayers to keep taxes low

356
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,999
Grover norquist is a famous anti-tax Crusade

357
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
He heard about ready return

358
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
And sprang into action

359
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
What is a wave

360
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
To raise taxes

361
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,495
A way to send people a bill for more taxes than they owe

362
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,823
And they're unlikely to contested people don't fight the IRS

363
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
Norquist.

364
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
Ready return is tantamount to attack

365
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Because once the government has taxpayer

366
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
Amazon autopilot

367
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Signing and sending

368
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
Bill start sneaking things in like the house cell phone

369
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Company sneakers

370
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,415
Little charges and you look at them and sort of wonder about them but

371
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
Any and you just pay because it's easy

372
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,327
And norquist has this famous pledge Republicans all across the country take it

373
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
And the pledge basically says

374
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
I will not support any plan that raises

375
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,983
And that was a problem

376
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
What happens if people break the pledge

377
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
When somebody breaks the pledge

378
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,919
Their opponents in the next election 10 to remind voters

379
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
They lied their way into office

380
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,783
I am depressed tends to focus on it

381
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,855
Northwest put out the words California Republic

382
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
If you back ready return

383
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
You have broken the pledge

384
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
Joe bankman this tax law professor and his loan lobbyists are now battling not only ammo

385
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
Multibillion-dollar soccer

386
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
Also one of the biggest

387
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
Names in US policy

388
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
Joe kept telling everyone this won't raise tax

389
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
It will just make it easier to pay them

390
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
Everyone time in money

391
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,431
But Joe says he talked to a lot of small government

392
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
And actually

393
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
They wanted pain

394
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
Taxes to be

395
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Their logic wise

396
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,367
If paying taxes it's difficult

397
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
People will hate tax

398
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
And vote against them

399
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Joe and Mike

400
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
And they started getting ground

401
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,351
Little by little with Democrats and Republicans

402
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
Locking downvotes

403
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
And a couple weeks out

404
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
They needed just

405
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,727
One more vote

406
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:18,591
One more vote to make ready return happen in the entire State of California

407
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
And then

408
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,431
I found a Republican

409
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
That was

410
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
Going to support it

411
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,807
Joe convinced a republican legislator to back

412
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Pledge

413
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
Ignore the campaign money

414
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,023
After a year of taking on corporate lobbyists political power Brokers at so many tok

415
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
Spending $35,000 a piece

416
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
His own money

417
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
This was it

418
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
Ready return

419
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
Look like it was going to happen

420
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
Just before the vote

421
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
Joe had to drive back.

422
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,103
Videos of the politicians who supported ready return

423
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
To keep him up

424
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
The day of the vote

425
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
Joe remembers getting a call

426
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
I could tell by the tone in his voice

427
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
What the answer

428
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
It was before I said any

429
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
He said

430
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,487
So and so I didn't forgot the legislators name is not with us looks like we're going to be one vote short

431
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
1

432
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Vote

433
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
Short

434
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
Republican and changed his mind and Joe

435
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Had lost

436
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,263
And all of the other states that I've been calling Joe asking how they could implement the plan like this

437
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
The kind of dropped away

438
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,359
It was it was a little bit crushing

439
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
Hot to lose like that

440
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
How much time have you invested

441
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
In a way it was a year of my life

442
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
It's a pretty big blow

443
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
SoJO

444
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
Joann back to teaching full time

445
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,487
But he kept pushing ready return

446
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
A version of it did survive in California

447
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,119
It's buried in the state's tax site but it's there

448
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
A few hundred thousand people use it every year

449
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,751
Curtis had a pretty interesting Legacy

450
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,079
Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders introduced a bill that looks a lot like red

451
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,407
Turn last year they referenced Jose pilot program

452
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
It didn't end up happen

453
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,503
But Joe says we keep getting close

454
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Eventually

455
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
He thinks it's going to happen

456
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
My fantasy

457
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
Is that

458
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:11,487
At some point it just makes so much sense will join the rest of the world

459
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:16,607
And I don't know how that's going to happen with our current political climate

460
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,959
Maybe some mid-level bureaucrat I'll just make the change herself

461
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,287
And it'll go through it'll kind of fly under the radar

462
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
That's what I think will happen sooner or

463
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Somehow

464
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,967
In the meantime people like Elizabeth and Matthew or first

465
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,783
Time us taxpayers and all the rest of us

466
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,063
Are stuck spending

467
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
Hundreds of dollars end

468
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
Many many hours

469
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
Filing our tax

470
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
It is not without its ups

471
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
I never would have even said so

472
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,327
Accomplishment away

473
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
Yeah it's like

474
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,191
I think I was saying Sally like if we can do this like we can do anything

475
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,239
This is probably the most daunting task

476
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
It would come across

477
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
Find tax return

478
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:02,175
Sazae-san couple could walk you to put their relationship since history file

479
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
Welcome to America

480
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,135
One less thing we found another

481
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,487
Interesting moment when someone tried to make people excited about paying their taxes

482
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
They wrote a song

483
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Right after this

484
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,495
Support for Planet Money and the following message come from ishares

Ishares by BlackRock inspired to build

489
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,623
For most of us history most people did not pay income

490
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,439
I've been to the forties only about 5%

491
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
American Pie

492
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
Income taxes at all

493
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,303
But during the forties the government needed to raise money

494
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
4 World War

495
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,887
So it rolled out a larger income tax about

496
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,423
75% of America

497
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,263
And this time people were pulled behind the government there was a lot of soup

498
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
Support behind wartime

499
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:07,711
And Irving Berlin was very patriotic guy and he was moved to write this song to get people behind paint

500
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Income taxes

501
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
To support the war

502
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,087
Here's a song you just called I paid my income tax today

503
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:19,488
I'm squared up with of USA

504
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:25,888
Vamos in the sky Rockefeller help the building

505
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:32,288
I think I preferred Jose version

506
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,848
Trying to make us love taxes

507
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
I don't know this one is so catchy

508
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,480
I feel like if that music were playing when I filed my taxes I would feel

509
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
So much better about finally

510
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
Everything everything is nicer with a little

511
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
Play music in the background with a jingle

512
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
