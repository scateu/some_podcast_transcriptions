Hey it's Jacob Goldstein quick note

10
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,040
Today's Show originally ran in May of 2005

11
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
What are the kid

12
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
Apples

13
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
Wer

14
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928
They were called red delicious

15
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,952
And they were red

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,744
They were not delish

17
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,560
They look beautiful but then you bite into it

18
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:38,144
And almost always it would be mushy and merely just

19
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,472
That's it was a really bad time to be an apple eater

20
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
It was also a really bad time to be an apple grower

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
Everybody

22
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,128
Really the spot little everybody was growing red delicious

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
This is Dennis courtier he's the owner of

24
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,504
Pepin Heights Orchard in Lake City Minnesota

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
We were probably going broke

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,648
You know we were being asked to deliver goods for below the cost of production

27
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
Of course you're trying to raise his prices some other farmer who was growing the exact same red delicious apples would say to

28
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,096
The buyers hate I'll sell them to you for Less

29
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
Because

30
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,192
Red delicious apples were this ubiquitous interchangeable thing

31
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
They were commodities

32
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
And making commodities

33
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
Whether it's

34
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,592
Cheap socks or metal screws or red delicious apples

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,384
Is a terrible business to be in

The guy who discovered the miracle Apple that one apple is name is David

54
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
When he was growing up you loved

55
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,640
Fruit but he hated Apple

56
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
Cuz all we ever knew were red delicious

57
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,272
But then he went off to college and one day for the first time in his life

58
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
He tasted a really good

59
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,416
Someone brought a bushel of yellow apples down from Michigan

60
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,792
Can they were fresh and they weren't really they didn't have a tough naugahyde like skin

61
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,632
They were crisp and juicy and I was amazed

62
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,936
So David Bedford thinks to himself

63
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,800
Why not make more amazing apples why not have amazing apples in the grocery store

64
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,664
He becomes an apple breeder devote his professional life to creating those

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Delicious app

66
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
But this is a tough

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
Things to devote your life to

68
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,320
Inventing a better Apple is really hard

69
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
For one thing

70
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
You want a new Apple

71
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
Going to take a long time

72
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:14,048
You know you find a couple of promising apples you cross breed them to collect The Offspring you get the seeds

73
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
You put them in the ground and then

74
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:21,728
You got to wait you got to wait for an apple tree to grow up out of the ground it's takes 5 years or more

75
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,824
Finally the tree grows up starts producing apples you pick one you taste it

76
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
And it sucks

77
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176
That's actually what happened 99.99%

78
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:36,576
I went to visit David Bedford at his trial Orchard at the University of Minnesota and he walked me out to the orchard

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,672
And I see rows and rows of little apple trees

80
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
Up the hillside ZIP down the hillside

81
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
He'd like them all to be great

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
But he knows they won't

83
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
If you look around you here

84
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:54,496
What we see around us here is probably five to six thousand trees that's not even enough really

85
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,288
Wait to have one that will be a winner

86
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,152
You're a you're a you're a tough judge of apple tree

87
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Well

88
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
You know we've got a lot of responsibility here we're trying to save the world from mediocre apples and we can't

89
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Let her guard down

90
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,696
And there's only one way the David Bedford can tell whether a tree is

91
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
Great mediocre worth keeping

92
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
He doesn't have a chemical test

93
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
He can't

94
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,655
Tell just by looking at them he has to walk the rose tree by tree

95
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
Taking an apple from each one

96
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,287
How many apples do you bite into it a day when you're going through Alexa

97
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:33,407
An average day at the peak of the Season would probably be five to six hundred

98
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
Is sooner or later somebody has to eat

99
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,551
That's the ultimate determination is the mouth and the

100
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
And the tongue in the brain

101
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,159
And so you have to take a bite

102
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
And you have to decide

103
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,999
There is a trick to tasting 500.

104
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
Bedford biting the Apple

105
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
Choose for a few seconds

106
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
End

107
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
This is

108
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
The creek doesn't swell

109
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,287
No great effort expended he just open the mouth and

110
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
Drop it on the ground drop it on the ground yeah

111
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
I don't even

112
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
Spit it out you just kind of

113
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:10,527
Electric Fallout like a like a two-year-old who suddenly decide take I don't want to eat this thing that's in my mouth

114
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,111
This trick this technique this is how he found the miracle app

115
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
It was years ago back in the early 1980s

116
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,255
David Bedford is walking down the trees

117
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
One by one

118
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Bite

119
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Spit

120
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Eddie comes to this one tree

121
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
Tree number 17

122
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
He picks an apple

123
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
He takes a bite

124
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
There was this moment of

125
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,407
Confusion maybe my goodness what is this this is not

126
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,807
Is a red delicious texture this is not even a good apple texture this is something Beyond

127
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,647
The two things that came to my mind number one was watermelon

128
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
The way the watermelon woken up

129
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,767
Break in your mouth and then did you squeeze out of it

130
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
And the other thing was Asian pears

131
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
Is that real

132
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,887
Christmas of an Asian pear

133
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,495
But I'd sorted that out enough to say I don't know what this is but it's good

134
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055
You don't know me I like it it was sweet

135
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
It was Chris

136
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
Tell they called it Honeycrisp

137
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,431
And Honeycrisp would eventually change the Applebee's

138
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
But it took a long time for that

139
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
Because think about this moment

140
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
David Bedford have a new app

141
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,159
Something different maybe better than all the apples in the store

142
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
He tells Apple Growers about this new

143
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,303
The Apple that's so much better than the Miele red delicious and everyone's eating

144
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
He says I got it I got it try this

145
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Honeygrow hours

146
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,447
They don't want they would bedford's amazing.

147
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,007
They don't want it because the grocery store

148
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,871
Becton the produce section was still pretty boring you know you went in you wanted lettuce

149
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
There's iceberg

150
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
That's it

151
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
You want tail

152
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
It's okay

153
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
You want apples

154
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
I remember a produce market or telling me when I first got into the business he says why are you

155
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,487
You guys trying to make more apples we don't need that

156
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
He said we have a red one

157
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,863
We have a yellow one and we have a green one that's all we need

158
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,959
This is a classic problem for an inventor you come up with something new something in

159
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Credible

160
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
But nobody really wants it nobody even knows about

161
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,383
Bedford probably needed a marketing team a big advertising

162
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Vanquish he didn't have any

163
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Was this one guy

164
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
That guy was Dennis courtier

165
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,623
Torture is the Apple grower from the beginning of the show was getting killed trying to grow red delicious

166
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,231
Could you to come by bedford's orchard every so often they say hey

167
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
You know you have anything good

168
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
You have anything different

169
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:35,423
One-time courtier came by and Bedford took him to 31711 Bedford took him to that honey

170
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
I said here

171
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
One of these

172
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
Courtier took a bite and thought

173
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
These could be the apples I've been waiting

174
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
They were that

175
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,151
Damn good and that damn difference

176
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
Porter makes a big bet

177
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,991
I start planning a lots of Honeycrisp

178
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
You don't know if it's going to work

179
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
Doesn't know if people are going to want these apples

180
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
But if they do so you can finally start making a decent profit because instead of growing the same Apple does everybody else

181
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
He'll be the only guy growing Honeycrisp

182
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
At least for awhile

183
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
He has a head start on every other Apple

184
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,263
Of course this being the Apple business he's going to have to wait a long time to figure out whether his bet will pay off

185
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
Lance the trees he waits for him to grow up they get bigger

186
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,199
And finally by the time the trees are starting to produce apples the supermarkets are

187
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
Ready for

188
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:25,599
They have gone beyond red delicious finally there are other apples that are starting to show up on the show

189
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
And when the Honeycrisp finally get to the store

190
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
They do great

191
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
We have retailers telling us

192
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
And it is still true

193
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
Honeycrisp

194
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
Elevated apples to a different level within their grocery stores the point that Honeycrisp has in many cases the

195
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
Dollar grossing

196
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
Not just Apple

197
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
They were the

198
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
Top grossing item in the whole store

199
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,735
You're not every week not every store not every part of the season

200
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:58,111
But when the air is at their Peak we have retailers who sell more dollars worth of are Honeycrisp every week

201
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
Then they sell 2 liter bottles

202
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Coca-Cola

203
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
That changes things

204
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
Grocery stores are dying to get

205
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
Courtiers

206
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
He's finally selling his apples at apra

207
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
Doing great making money

208
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,239
But before long he sees other people planting Honeycrisp

209
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,615
And he knows that pretty soon there will be tons of farmers competing against into sell honey

210
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,455
He'll be back in that red delicious world where you can't make a profit

211
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,271
Honeycrisp will just be this delicious commodity

212
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
Courtier realized

213
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,879
And this was really the final step in this story

214
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,695
That she needed to do more than find a delicious app

215
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,303
He needed to figure out a way to keep that delicious apple to himself and

216
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
Maybe just a few selected other farmer

217
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
I remember

218
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Pacific discussion

219
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
And which a number of us

220
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
What if what if

221
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
If we did this what if we did that

222
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,151
What if when we find the next great Apple

223
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,223
A small group of us could control the supply of it

224
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
Make sure we grow enough

225
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:04,671
To keep the supermarket happy not too many so the price doesn't crash make sure the apples handled well so that still good

226
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:10,815
So Shoppers still want to buy it and you might be able to do this with a patent right you can patent an apple in fact

227
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,399
Bedford and the University of Minnesota had patented the honey

228
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,007
But they let anybody who wanted to plant it Farmers just had to pay a small royalty

229
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
Anyway more importantly

230
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,383
A patent lasts for 20 years which in a business where it takes

231
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
5 years or more just a grow a tree is not that long

232
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,295
By the time Honeycrisp was really taken off its patent was expiring

233
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,623
Dan courtier at his friends looked around and they saw something interest

234
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,695
Clever Australian company gone beyond patents

235
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
They had gotten a trademark

236
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
On the name

237
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Pink lady

238
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Further app

239
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,351
That's pink lady with a little TM

240
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Betrayed

241
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,191
Unlike a Patent Trademark never expire

242
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
You give an apple a name

243
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
You trademark that name

244
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:56,383
And then you get to decide forever who gets to grow and who gets to sell apples

245
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
Under that name

246
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
Cartoon his friends wanted to do that

247
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
But they needed a new app

248
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
About 10 years ago they found it they found it at that same Orchard run by David Bedford at the University of Minnesota

249
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
And quarter of this time

250
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
He talked to Bedford and the university into

251
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
Trademarking that apple

252
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
They call it

253
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Sweet Tango

254
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Just one key

255
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Swe

256
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Tianjin

257
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
TM

258
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
Only 45 farmers are allowed to grow it

259
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
We have just shy of a million trees in the ground

260
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
And it's going quite well

261
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
The great Apple

262
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
Grow more and sell more of them every year

263
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Panda

264
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,575
We're trying to figure out how quickly we can wrap it up

265
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,927
If you are an apple grower and you are not part of the sweet Tango growing club

266
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
Well go find another club there are a lot of so-called Club apples now being grown arriving in the grocery store

267
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
Each one has a name more ridiculous

268
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Then the last

269
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
What's new with you

270
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Envy

271
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Cosmic crisp

272
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Jazz

273
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
Was kanzi Lady Alice

274
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,871
Pacific Rose pinata Ruby Frost

275
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Snapdragon

276
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Exactly

277
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,271
Exactly and that is not even the end of the

278
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
When one little detail it's

279
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:13,695
Only the name that's trademarked so even if you're not in the club you can roll the Apple you just can't use the name

280
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
Pro tip

281
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
If you see pink lady and

282
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,303
Cripps pink in the same store

283
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Just buy whichever one's cheaper

284
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
Because they're the same Apple

285
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,471
All these apples with their ridiculous names are

286
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Brandt

287
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
Each apple is brand and

288
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
You could imagine a future where saying

289
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
Hey can you pick me up some apples

290
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
Sounds as ridiculous as saying

291
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,967
Hey can you pick me up a six-pack of cola

292
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
You don't think Cola

293
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
You say Coke

294
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
/ Pepsi

295
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
The brand is the thin

296
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,439
Tim Burns used to run the promotional campaign for the sweet Tango Apple

297
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,791
And he says apples now will be like every other item in the groceries

298
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:55,423
They will have their own Brands they will have their own marketing teams their own advertising blitzes

299
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,239
It is going to be a world of managed

300
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,823
Brands just like the soup aisle or the potato chip aisle

301
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,407
Or any other aisle this is what it's going to be going forward

302
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
There's something a little sad about

303
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
Even Apple

304
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
You know this

305
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Basic

306
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
Natural thing

307
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,135
Are now in the world of Brands and advertising

308
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
And marketing

309
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,743
But all that is driving people to create and sell

310
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Really good app

311
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,071
So if you really like apples

312
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:27,935
And you're willing to pay for a really great delicious new Apple you can now find

313
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
And you know what if you don't want to pay more

314
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
You can still get red delicious

315
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,647
