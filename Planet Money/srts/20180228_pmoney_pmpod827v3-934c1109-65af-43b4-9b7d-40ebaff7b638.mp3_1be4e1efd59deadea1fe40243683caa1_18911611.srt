The u.s. really sells to World II we're going to tell you how conservative tax policy ended up being

24
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Kinda sorta would a liberal Economist have been helping for and it's causing some mixed feelings

Iverson Decatur

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,640
2.2 trillion dollars that's about how much stuff

38
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
Goods and services

39
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
The US sells to the rest of

40
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
The world every year

41
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
That's a lot

42
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,624
But it's when you dig into the details that you really start to see some fascinating patterns

43
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,904
Set it talk about it

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,208
I called up Charles Kenny he's a senior fellow

45
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
The center for Global development

46
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,304
Charles has been researching and writing about globe

47
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
While

48
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
But frankly he's also

49
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
Just a fun dude

50
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
To talk to you about

51
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
Trade

52
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
You can even kind of hear it

53
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
Newsboys how delighted he is

54
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,080
To discuss us

55
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,224
In a week sportmachines report vehicle export agricultural products

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Tronicsfix what minerals

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,880
Huge range of stuff I was just saying that our exports are tremendously

58
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Varied

59
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
To get a sense of this

60
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,720
Consider the top three categories

61
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
Good

62
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
So physical thing

63
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
It's not service

64
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
That we export

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
Noah's Ark

66
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
Refined oil products

67
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
Cars

68
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
An airplane

69
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,984
Put them all together and they still only add up to about 11

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,776
Percent of the value of all Goods

71
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
We export

72
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
And you don't have to search far down the list

73
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
To start finding

74
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Surprising stuff

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,504
1.4% of what the US exports of stuff

76
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
Is blood

77
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,904
We turn out to be a a will be done in blood exports

78
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
Majin Buu

79
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,280
The absolutely human blood products

80
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
What what reason is in Europe during the Mad Cow outbreak

81
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,752
A few years ago people worried that we couldn't

82
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,336
Screen map out the blood supplies and so a lot of blood plasma

83
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
Was exported from the US to Europe

84
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
I'm an exit of continued

85
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,040
Another is frankly that in the United States unlike most places you can pay people

86
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,648
Making donations of plasma in Blood and so

87
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
There a hole in his car accident victims in the United Kingdom and France and I wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't

88
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,144
Us blood circulating in their veins I think it's a good news story

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
And all this variety the

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Blood and stuff Kenny mention

91
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
That's good

92
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,848
Because it's healthy that the country isn't really dependent on any one thing that sells abroad

93
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
Buddy says

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
Our exports themselves

95
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,200
Are depending on

96
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
Are dependent on

97
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:11,648
If you look at the Boeing Dreamliner for example the wingtips made in Korea a lot of parts of the rest of the wing and made into

98
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:17,536
Penn landing gear is made in France some of the engines made in the United Kingdom that comes together

99
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,583
India Boeing factories in Seattle

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
And then we expect

101
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,959
If you didn't have Alibis in Port Bowen couldn't make

102
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,055
The Dreamliner couldn't expose it and that we really bad the US trade

103
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,383
Because if we were to make all of those parts in the US

104
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
The Dreamliner would be so expensive

105
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,015
That would be way harder to then exported abroad

106
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
There was one last

107
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
No Doubt

108
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,623
Some things we export

109
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Never leave

110
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
The country

111
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
So huge us export cattle

112
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
About 200 billion dollars

113
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
Travel

114
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
Text people from abroad who

115
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
Kunming tourist run

116
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,375
Business trips

117
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
Or students coming here to go to

118
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
School

119
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
Think about it this way

120
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
For something to count as an export

121
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,871
Someone who is outside the US just has to buy something from a business inside the U

122
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,015
So take somebody in Britain they can buy their Mickey Mouse doll in the Disney Store in London

123
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,343
And that'll count is some of that would count as an export from the United

124
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,159
Statesboro they can come to Disneyland in

125
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
The Mickey Mouse dolls

126
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,583
Then no rain by the hotel and

127
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,655
Call rental and food and so on

128
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
An overlap counts of Mexico and it's a really important parts of the US economy

129
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Coming to the US

130
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
Education

131
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
American universities in

132
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Schools make nearly

133
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
40 billion dollars from

134
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Foreign students

135
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,647
It's a big one and it's a very important one possibly because most foreign students he come to the United States Phoenix Faith pay full price

136
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
They

137
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Help

138
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,791
Support the university providing more money for

139
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,655
And I nice a sports equipment smaller class sizes better teachers hopefully

140
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Letter words

141
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,519
Even though trade is about the movement of goods and services across borders

142
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,103
Kids separated from the movement of people across border

143
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
For a list of all the sources we used for this part of the episode and there were a lot of them

144
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,879
Go to npr.org money where we posted

145
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,303
Our next indicator is 1.8 trillion dollars

146
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
We're going to explain what that number is

147
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
First

148
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,167
We have to tell you about Jared Burns

149
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Yes we do

150
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
Because Jared Bernstein

151
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Is a man with a dog

152
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,079
He's a liberal Economist who worked on President Obama's economic

153
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
And he's been arguing for years.

154
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,175
Did the US need more economic

155
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Stimulus

156
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
So some combination

157
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Lower taxes

158
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
And higher spending

159
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,343
To really get the economy going and in particular

160
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
Start driving up wages

161
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
For workers

162
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,231
Even now he still thinks the economy can use a bit more

163
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,071
Now in the past few months the republican-controlled Congress passed

164
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Ascot

165
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
And also approved a big new spending bill

166
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,215
Both of which were signed into law by a Republican president by present

167
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,799
Trump and combined these will add an estimated 1.8

168
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Australian dollars

169
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
Budget deficits in the next

170
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
That is our indicator

171
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
1.8 trillion dollars

172
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
Now these two bills were not sold

173
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
A stimulus package

174
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
They are definitely not Jared Bernstein

175
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
Liberal stimulus dream come true

176
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
But they are going to mean lower tax

177
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
Suzanne higher spending

178
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
So they are

179
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
Kind of sort of

180
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
The thing he's been arguing

181
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Not

182
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,471
The basic idea behind government stimulus

183
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Is that

184
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
City economies

185
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Not doing as well.

186
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,871
Sometimes the government can help the economy get back to it

187
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Best self

188
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
By spending more money

189
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Or putting tax

190
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
The Ordinary People themselves

191
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Have more money to spend

192
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
So when Jared Bernstein thinks about the

193
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
Republican tax bill and

194
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Spending increases

195
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
She has to answer to Quest

196
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,463
One is the economy it

197
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Best self right now

198
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Into

199
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
Will the tax cut in Spanish

200
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
His work as a

201
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,935
When roasting started working for the Obama Administration

202
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
The answer to

203
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
Is the economy

204
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Is best self or

205
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Stimulus

206
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Was pretty simple

207
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:18,943
I vividly remember us getting together in December of 2008 when the economy was

208
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Really falling off a cliff

209
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Is the technical term

210
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
That must have been quite a meeting

211
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Did you guys look for

212
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Flask or some

213
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:30,975
Yeah we needed a flask so let me just tell you that there was absolutely not the slightest Inkling

214
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Conflict

215
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,607
In my or my colleague mind about the need for a deep and robust and

216
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Quick acting

217
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
Keynesian stimulus

218
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
But today

219
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
10 years later the unemployment rate is

220
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
Slow the economy

221
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
Growing is adding jobs

222
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Every month

223
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
And the value of stimulus then is

224
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
Much less clue

225
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,943
We are in the midst of a

226
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
Solid economy no question

227
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
So my

228
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,575
Kind of nuance what I'm bringing to the table and I guess

229
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
It's different than a lot of my brothers and sisters in this

230
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,695
In any economic field right now

231
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,767
Is that I think we can go further

232
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Jared

233
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Esteem stimuli

234
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
And the reason is job

235
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,703
Unemployment seems low but Jared thinks it can go lower and that

236
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Would be great for

237
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,799
Yes things are good but they can be better

238
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,127
Especially for people who been left behind the only way

239
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
The least Advantage people

240
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
In this economy

241
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
Experian

242
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,551
Their share of of the growth

243
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,391
Is when we get to and stay at not just full employment

244
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,999
But Chalkville employment really tight labor markets and that's what I'm hoping to look for

245
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
When employers are desperate for workers

246
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,095
It is harder for them the employers

247
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
To discriminate

248
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,679
Wages go up benefits go up workers

249
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Just have more

250
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,567
Power but the risk to adding too much stimulus to a good economy is real

251
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,127
It could cause inflation it could drive prices up

252
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
An end up hurting the very

253
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
People that it's supposed to be

254
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Be helping

255
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,503
Still on question number one

256
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
Is the economy is best self right now

257
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
Short answer is no

258
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
And he thinks stimulus

259
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,439
A question for him is question number 2

260
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
Are the tax cuts and

261
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
Spending increases

262
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Good

263
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,095
Not even good just are they better than that

264
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
The benefits of these particular stimuli

265
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,751
Not all physical stimulus is created equal

266
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
She does like the spending in

267
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
Those are short-term

268
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
I'm just a couple of years

269
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
He thinks they'll give the economy a nice boost

270
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,967
The tax cuts though are not the kind of tax

271
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Scott's to Jared with a

272
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Chosen

273
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
He says the largely benefit

274
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
Hit the rich side

275
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
Projections

276
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,391
Showing that the majority of their benefits

277
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
We'll go to the wealthiest Americans

278
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
Increase

279
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
Inequalities

280
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,791
But he says for the next couple of years

281
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
They still might be good for the economy

282
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,911
According to some research that's of high-quality and I believe it

283
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
The combination of the

284
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
The tax cuts in the spending bill

285
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
Are going to add a little bit more than half a point

286
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
2 GDP growth

287
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
This year and next year

288
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
In other words

289
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,455
The tax cuts combined with the spending increase

290
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Will give the economy the booze

291
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
The Jared thing

292
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
So far so good

293
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
But your toes

294
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
There's a problem

295
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
A lot of tax cut isn't just

296
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
For the next few years

297
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Permanent

298
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Semi permit

299
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
And he says that is a bad idea

300
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
He thinks the government

301
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
Is going to need to raise more money

302
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
You're not less just

303
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
In case there's another recession

304
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
2 pesos

305
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
Security and Medicare

306
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Self

307
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
How does Gerard Way all of this

308
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,919
Yeah the brain start the kind of breakdown you are

309
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,991
Sharing an economist who is admittedly conflicted about all this

310
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:38,111
I think what's happening right now in terms of fiscal stimulus

311
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,695
And part of that is the tax cut is a welcome

312
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
Experiment I think what

313
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
Slated to happen starting in

314
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,607
2019-2020 and going forward

315
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Is

316
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,911
Fiscally Reckless

317
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
Indian Jared said

318
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
She worries that the cost

319
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
Long term tax

320
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
That will be larger than the benefits

321
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
Short-term stimulus

322
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
If they'd come packaged together

323
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,967
Jared says it overall he would vote

324
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Against that

325
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,063
But it was obviously a tough call for him and in any case

326
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
This is the

327
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Stimulus we got

328
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
Just wasn't the stimulus

329
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
Just Jared wanted

330
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,719
So we'll just have to see in the next couple of years

331
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
What that stimulus means

332
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
The economy

333
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
And how the tax cuts play out in the years after the

334
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
Coming up after the break

335
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
A story about the

336
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Flower

337
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Powers beer

338

Flower power

339
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
Flower power

340
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
I know

Specifically $1 per pound

351
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,759
That is the low price of Cascade hops

352
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
I talked about this number with Douglas McKay

353

With the beer makers who

357
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
In what

358
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
What are hops

359
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Okay

360
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
We're getting really big

361
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
Goodnight I used to get that question all the time actually

362
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,007
About 10 or 15 years ago before craft beer became popular I would

363
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,079
People ask what I do they have no clue what hops were

364
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
Today it's totally different today everybody

365
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
It's kind of like a cult

366
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Coco Pops

367
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
Hops are the flowers of the Hop plant

368
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
They look like little cone

369
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
Enter used in making beer

370
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623

374
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
They will tell you all about it

375
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,095
And as the market for craft beer exploded over the last decade

376
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
The demand for hops

377
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
Intelligent

378
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,007
Douglas MacKinnon has lived through the whole rise and fall of hops

379
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
He started working in the business in 99

380
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
99

381
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Thanks for a really bad shape.

382
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
Farmers were struggling

383
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,711
It was bad thanks for calling the industry unthinkable

384
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
It looked

385
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Pretty bleak

386
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,903
The industry was ruled by the big beer maker

387
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Scores in fide

388
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,511
But then craft beer started taking off in the

389
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,583
And they started becoming a bigger force in the industry

390
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
Everything was moving so fast

391
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
It was just crazy

392
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,751
And craft beer uses way more hops than beers like Coors and die

393
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
About ten times more hops

394
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
Also craft beer makers

395
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
Did not just want mainstream

396
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,479
They wanted Farmers to start planting a special Hops and a bunch of different kinds of Pop

397
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
To give their beer distinctive

398
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
Citra Simcoe

399
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
Amarillo

400
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
Mosaic

401
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Probably the most

402
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Popular

403
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
Is Cascade

404
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
That's kind of

405
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
Gateway hop into Aroma House

406
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,631
In 2012 Douglas and his wife founded the company called 47

407
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:06,239
They are middleman they take orders from Craft Brewers with a 5000 lb of

408
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
Mosaico Amarillo

409
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Any find a farmer who will grow it

410
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
And business

411
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Was great

412
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
For the first couple years we never had to do

413
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Any

414
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,039
They'll be kind of calls when everybody was calling us

415
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
I was just

416
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
So much

417
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Demanded so much

418
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
Excitement and so much

419
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Energy I guess

420
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
It's like a

421
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
Ride on a rocket ship I suppose

422
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
So prices going up as

423
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,911
I didn't even talk about prices

424
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
Ya prices

425
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
The price of hops

426
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Went nuts

427
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Douglas says

428
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
Cascade

429
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,591
Deep Gateway hops

430
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
Win from around

431
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,919
$3 a pound more than $7

432
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
What's pound on hold

433
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,247
Farmers could not plan too fast

434
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
Meanwhile all kinds of different people were jumping into the craft beer business

435
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
Calling up people like Douglass to get hooked up

436
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Hops and

437
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Brewing new beers

438
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,999
Farmers did what farmers do with the price

439
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
Democrat Gazette

440
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
They planted more and more

441
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
Demand Justice

442
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Kept growing

443
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
And then just over a year ago

444
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
Something changed

445
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:12,543
We noticed that cash flow started slowing down for not paying you on time

446
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Right

447
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:18,175
The Brewers weren't paying Douglas on time because craft beer sales were not booming like they

448
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
Initially yours

449
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
All these people were trying craft beer in

450
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,575
Switching over to it and growth in the industry was

451
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,367
Crazy but like 20% a year

452
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,671
Most people have tried crack

453
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,023
You're in the people who are going to switch over to craft. Already switched over to craft beer and people are going to stay

454
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
The big beers were sticking with the big beers

455
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
Ambrose slow down

456
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
From nearly 20% to about 5

457
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
I'm still growing

458
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
Just a lot more slowly than everybody

459
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Prepared for

460
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
And here's the thing

461
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Planting hops

462
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
Requires huge upfront investment

463
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
And the plants take years to mature

464
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,503
You can just rip hops out and plan something else when the price goes down

465
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,831
So even if the Craft Beer Market was leveling off this

466
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:01,439
Huge wave hops that have been planted during the boom had just started coming to Market

467
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
Suddenly there was a glut

468
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Apopse

469
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,583
Douglas says the wholesale price for Cascade the Gateway hops

470
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,631
Went from around $8 a pound

471
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
2 as little as a dollar

472
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,751
Suddenly Douglas's company was millions of dollars in debt

473
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
And he and his wife realized

474
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
They were drowning on the wall and it was

475
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
It was clear this was a

476
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Beginning

477
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,015
Last year Douglas and his wife filed for chapter 11

478
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Another says

479
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,087
The whole industry is struggling

480
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
Not that anyone's actually talking about

481
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
It's mostly a

482
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
Guy dominated industry to maybe there's some kind of Macho thing going on there I don't know but nobody wants to

483
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
Admit that they're having trouble

484
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Publicly

485
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
But privately

486
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,495
Everybody's petsall Everybody's talking

487
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
Douglas still believes in Hopsin

488
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
And crafts

489
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,383
He thinks everyone is just going to have to adjust

490
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
This new normal

491
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
No more crazy quotes

492
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
Just more of a slow and steady

493
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,807
He and his wife are adjusting their company 47hops

494
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,135
And he says they're on track to be out of bankruptcy in June

495
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,279
By the way we learned about the great hospice from a story in the financial
