8
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
Producers here

9
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,752
And I'm going to let you in on a little secret

10
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,520
About the news

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,336
If you work for a big

12
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,128
And you have some bad

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,920
There are two

14
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,968
Perfect times to tell the world about it

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
Christmas Eve

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
And the day before Thanksgiving

17
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
If you release your bad news on one of those days

18
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,720
Chances are very few people will ever hear

19
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,512
Which is why

20
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
When on the day before Thanksgiving

21
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
We heard some news

22
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
We almost

23
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
Mystic

24
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,424
And we would have missed it

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
If it weren't

26
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
For one person

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Hey there

28
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
This is

29
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:22,432
Kelly mcevers of course host of all things considered and also one of our favorite podcast

30
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456
Embedded

31
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,016
Kelly the latest season of your show is about

32
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808
Who what exactly

33
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
President

34
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:35,232
Donald Trump we did stories about the real estate that has his name on it and about the people who he throws

35
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
And today I'm sure we're going to play a part of an episode you did about Trump Soho if this

36
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,984
A big hotel condominium Tower in lower Manhattan

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
It's called Trump Soho

38
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,336
Trump company the Trump organization

39
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
Did not build this Tower

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,480
Actually license the Trump name to the people who did build the Tower and they managed

41
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,528
And then

42
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,368
On the day before Thanksgiving this day when news can happen in people can miss it

43
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,416
The Trump organization actually announced

44
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,976
That they were cutting their ties with Miller

45
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,632
So today we are not going to let them bury that news we're going to play Kelly's Terrific show about

46
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,936
About the developers that built Trump Soho

47
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,264
A lot of developers of this building and

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,824
We focused on one in particular

49
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
The company called Bay Rock

50
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,920
And a guy named

51
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
Felix

00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136

00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,808
Now we're going to talk about one of the developer

61
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Soho

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,976
And to know the story about this developer you need to know the story of a guy named

63
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
Felix Sater

64
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,168
The two NPR reporters who did this

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,448
Are Alina cell

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
Hello hello hello and

67
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Jim zarroli

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Hello hello

69
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:29,664
Satyr was from the former Soviet Union came here as a child

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064
Living in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn which is home to a lot of Russian immigrants Felix taters father has it

71
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,136
Criminal history he wants to plead guilty to extortion charges

72
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,184
He wants his son to do better

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
You wanted Felix to

74
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
BR and aboveboard businessman

75
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
That was

76
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
Felix fathers

77
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
Hope for his son

78
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
That's David Barry he's a former AP reporter and he's spent a lot of time covering organized crime he covered the mob scene

79
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
In Providence Rhode Island

80
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,664
He actually ended up writing a memoir with a guy named Sal Lauria

81
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Asbury

82
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Your friends would say

83
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,552
Nation Dad here that we did try to talk to Felix Sater himself

84
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
Through his lawyer he'd

85
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
So like

86
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
David Berry just said Felix Sater father wants him to be an above-board businessman

87
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,047
I guess we could High School Lee take some college classes

88
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
The Graduate

89
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,631
And then he becomes a stockbroker

90
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
With his friend

91
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,167
Salary

92
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,519
And so Felix Sater and this guy celoria grew up

93
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
To be

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
Lifeline brokers

95
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
Wall Street

96
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
Bagon

97
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Suits

98
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,687
Have nice watches or Suave

99
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
Diapers

100
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
And

101
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
Felix Sater

102
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,319
Trouble with the law starts at the

103
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
Party One Night in 1991

104
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,439
South hedges

105
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,255
Pasta Brokers exams very hard to pass

106
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,655
You're out celebrating a nice night of celebration at a nice restaurant that's

107
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Specialized margaritas

108
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,567
There's this other broker who's there at the time somehow a fight breaks out over a woman

109
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,735
He looks exploded and smash this heavy margarita glass you know it was a god

110
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
Not like martini glass

111
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,831
And he just in

112
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
Half a second or more

113
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
Cut the skies facial

114
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,303
And kept swearing at him after knocking them down and leaving his face all bloody

115
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Maps

116
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
Their times reported the man suffered nerve damage and later needed 110 stitches in his face

117
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,895
Felix Sater ends up going to prison

118
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,687
And he loses his broker's license

119
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,015
The really big thing for him was a

120
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,623
Felony conviction bars you from setting foot on a brokerage

121
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:52,255
Floor many years later in 2016 Sater told a Russian news site

122
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
But this drunken brawl is he says

123
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
Makes him a criminal

124
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,423
And he can't even get hired as a driver app

125
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,799
And yet that really wasn't the end of Felix Sater is Criminal

126
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
After Felix Sater gets out of jail

127
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
The margarita glass inside

128
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,063
Court documents show that he and Sal Lauria

129
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Then started what's noon

130
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
As a pump and dumps

131
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,463
Satyr and other people would buy up shares of stock

132
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,535
Through offshore accounts without telling investors about it

133
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,631
By buying up a lot of shares they would artificially inflate the

134
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
Price of the Securities they were selling

135
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
What's the price was in

136
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Inflated Court

137
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
They would sell the stock

138
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
To annoy

139
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Knowing investor

140
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,943
At the time the FBI said Felix Sater and saluria were part of an operation

141
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
That made 40 million dollars

142
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
And we should say here that

143
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,695
Seder and salary weren't operating by themselves

144
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
They had help from the Italian mafia

145
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Again this is from the cortex

146
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,351
Something like that

147
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,655
On a large scale you need muscle

148
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,263
I mean you can't just get a politely ask the other Brokers not to sell the stock

149
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
Picture trying to inflate

150
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,871
But if you have two guys who were soldiers for the Gambino

151
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
And they show up in

152
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
The Brokerage

153
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Broker's license

154
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
They're not listening. In at that point

155
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
Listening to

156
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Dominic and sunny

157
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,183
Valeria and Felix Sater operation is discovered by a thorn

158
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
They're arrested and

159
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Hughes

160
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,303
Conspiring with the mafia to launder money

161
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Defraud invest

162
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,471
In 1998 Felix Sater pleads guilty to one count of racketeering is part of the

163
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
40 million dollars

164
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Scheme

165
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
And here is where things get even more in

166
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Instead of being sentenced

167
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,015
The charges against him were sealed and the case against him with basically

168
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
Frozen four years

169
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,855
And the reason was that

170
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,207
He turned State's evidence he started to become a cooperating witness for the government

171
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,023
And he became a really valuable witness over the next

172
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
Next 10 years or so

173
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
There was an FBI agent who testified at a sentencing hearing gears

174
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Translator who said

175
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
You know the difference between us

176
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:18,175
Ice cracking a case of not cracking a case is very often just one good cooperating witness in

177
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,735
Felix Sater was that witness for us

178
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,927
One thing Felix Sater reportedly help the US government do

179
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,231
What's to try to get Stinger missiles

180
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,071
Shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles have been used in Afghanistan

181
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Off the black market

182
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,703
We read this and that book by David Berry and Saul Lauria

183
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
It's called the Scorpion and the Frog

184
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,871
In the 90s Sater reportedly travel to Russia remember he's from there

185
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
And located a dozen of these Stinger missiles on the black market

186
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,527
Satyr offered to buy the weapons ostensibly

187
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
To keep them away from terrorists

188
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,415
And in return the CIA promise to keep Cedar from going to prison

189
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
The deal

190
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Ultimately fell through

191
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,303
But the contacts that are made where helpful

192
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
To the CIA and the FBI

193
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
After 9/11

194
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
We should say here that sound.

195
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,383
Buda the accuracy of the Scorpion and the Frog right before it came out

196
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,479
In an effort to stop it from being published in the early 2000s

197
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,855
But since then David Berry says Sal has told him the book is accurate after all

198
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,671
And salary is name is still on the book

199
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,999
And this is where we now finally returned to the story of

200
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
I'm so ho

201
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
Because what happens after this is

202
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
Felix Sater has gone through

203
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
Trenton jail and then

204
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
Turn has an informant in order to

205
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
To avoid his

206
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
For the

207
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,359
I'm a dumb scheme but then that second part

208
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
Becomes a secret

209
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,759
Like everything you just heard about Felix Sater sporty million-dollar pump and dump scheme

210
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
And his cooperation with the government

211
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Goes into a vault

212
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
Jim said

213
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
The file is sealed by the court

214
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
4 years

215
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
And Felix Sater

216
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Reinvent

217
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
And the next thing that he moves on to

218
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Is

219
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,447
And you real estate investment company called The Bay Rock

220
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,823
A new real estate company called the favor

221
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
One of the Developers

222
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
Who would later go on

223
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
To build Trump Soho

224
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
And the reason we're talking about

225
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Satyr and

226
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
Bayrock is because

227
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
There are two very important question

228
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,511
One of them reportedly of interest to investigators working with

229
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Counsel Robert Mueller right now

230
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Here's a possible

231
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
Where did Barack

232
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Get the money

233
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
To help build

234
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Soho

235
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
And here's the other Quest

236
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,383
Did Donald Trump know about Felix Sater past

237
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
Is a convicted felon

238
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Because if you did

239
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Well

240
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Be a problem

241
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
But that part of the story

242
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,071
This message comes from NPR sponsor Capital One

243
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,119
Capital One is reimagining banking

244
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,679
I offering accounts with no fees or minimum

245
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,495
I can be open from anywhere in 5 minutes

246
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Capital One

247
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
What's in your wallet

248
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
Capital One na

249
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:31,967
So we've heard the story of Felix Sater now we're going to hear the story of the real estate company

250
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Bayrock

251
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
The companies founded in 2001

252
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,159
And in the next few years they reportedly have their first meeting with Donald

253
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
Trump

254
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
And they got an office

255
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
At Trump Tower

256
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:48,095
2 floors beneath where the Trump family conducted their own business at the Trump organization

257
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
That's Tim O'Brien he's

258
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Bloomberg

259
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,215
And he's been reporting on Donald Trump for decades

260
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
So at some point

261
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
Bayrock and the other developers come to

262
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,615
Did Trump with this idea of building Trump Soho

263
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
And the picture is this

264
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Let's build this

265
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
46 story condo hotel

266
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
You put your name on it

267
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,087
But you don't have to invest any of your money we will raise

268
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
The money

269
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
You get equity in the building

270
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
Plus you'll be facing management

271
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
It's called a licensing

272
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
Trump is in a lot of these kind of

273
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
The Years Around the

274
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,863
And here's why this deal Maids

275
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Whisper Bay Rock

276
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
It's free publicity

277
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,727
The Trump name is known globally

278
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,567
For them it amounted to hitching their

279
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Wagon

280
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
To approve in Star

281
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Star of The Apprentice

282
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
A well-known business name

283
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
And here's why that makes sense for

284
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Trump

285
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Remember

286
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
By this point

287
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
Trump's businesses have been through several bankruptcy

288
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,183
And Trump cannot get loans from major Bank

289
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
From Trump's perspective

290
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,327
Anybody walked into Trump Tower and put a bag of money on his desk

291
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
To do business with them

292
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,167
This conclusion is based on what Tim O'Brien sources

293
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Told him

294
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,495
So this licensing deal is

295
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
Clearly a win win

296
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
For Trump and

297
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Incomes that TV announcer

298
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,759
Sprint located in the center of

299
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,367
That we do not know everything about where they Rock and the other developers of Trumps have

300
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Who got their money

301
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
But there is one guy

302
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
Who claims he has an inch

303
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Inside view of

304
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
He works there

305
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
Same as Jody Kriss

306
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,935
And one of the few reporters who is interview Jody Chris on the record

307
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
Is Tim O'Brien

308
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:35,359
Call Jody Chris grew up in Miami he was a very good student he went to Wharton he excelled in math math

309
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
Attics and finance

310
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,687
And he wanted to be a New York City real estate in

311
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,735
At one point he meets

312
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,087
Felix Sater Felix called him up and said you should come and join us if a rock

313
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
We've got

314
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,207
A lot of money we got some big developments in the pipeline

315
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,535
And ultimately said you'll get a chance to work with Donald Trump

316
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
So Jodi Chris goes to work at Bay Rock

317
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
In Fairly short order he starts to realize he's in the middle of what he would describe as a car crashed poorly managed

318
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:08,895
There's a lot of money flowing through it but he doesn't know where the money's coming from Jody Chris later filed a lawsuit against

319
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
Bayrock which lays out all these allegations

320
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,855
In the suit Jody Chris says everytime bayrock ran out of cash money with just magically show up

321
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,183
Sometimes from another bayrock Founders brother

322
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,767
Who had access to cash from a chromium refinery in Kazakhstan

323
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,143
And then in 2007 this investment fund from Iceland called FL group

324
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,239
Announces that it will invest 50 million dollars in bayrock

325
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
And Jody Kriss

326
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
Had never heard of it

327
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,127
He enquired of his partner's well who is the FL group

328
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
And why are we doing business with them and in fact

329
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
We have better offers

330
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,295
Or at least comprable offers

331
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,879
From other investors so why are we going with this Bank

332
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,231
And Chris was told he says

333
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:01,631
That we have to go with the SL group because it's closer to Putin Vladimir Putin

334
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
President of Russia

335
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,751
Teddy Crystal Tim O'Brien he thought it was a joke when they said Putin

336
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
But he didn't know how to make sense of it all

337
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
The Kremlin has denied any connection to the FL

338
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
Groupon

339
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
We should be clear here

340
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,271
Taking money from Russian people isn't crime

341
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,343
But what Jody Kriss alleged in this lawsuit

342
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
Except bayrock

343
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,927
Was basically a money-laundering up

344
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Operation

345
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,279
In other words his suit says it was taking dirty money

346
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
From Kazakhstan in Iceland

347
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
And hiding it in what looked like a legitimate business they Rock

348
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Built Trump Soho

349
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,823
In the lawsuit Jody Chris says there's no evidence that Donald Trump took any

350
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
Part in or knew of

351
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
They Rock

352
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Earrings

353
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
Either way bayrock has denied

354
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
The allegation

355
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,367
So back to Jody Chris and this 50 million dollar investment from FL group

356
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
To be a rock

357
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
Jody Chris was frustrate

358
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
He was a partner

359
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
He wasn't getting

360
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,047
He went back to his partners and said

361
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,423
Looky you owe me more money than you paid out the FL group just put 50 million dollars

362
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Into our company

363
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
I think

364
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
Based on that deal and others I mode

365
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
At least several million dollars

366
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
And this

367
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
Is where Jody Chris says

368
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Things get ugly

369
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,247
And according to Chris they said not only

370
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:27,647
Are we not going to pay you that but if you push the matter

371
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
Physical harm will come to you here's what the lawsuit actually says

372
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:40,447
Shader made him an offer he couldn't refuse either take $500,000 keep quiet

373
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:46,847
I had to leave all the rest of his money behind or make trouble and be killed

374
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:53,247
Jody Chris would not talk to us on the record

375
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,391
Bayrock said it can't comment on ongoing litigation and Felix Sater his lawyer told us

376
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
Jody Chris's lawsuit is extortionate

377
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Litigation

378
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,071
Either way there's one more important thing to know about Judy Chris's lawsuit against

379
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Bierock

380
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
The legal proceedings

381
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
Start dredging up Felix

382
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Past

383
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,263
Specifically the pump and dump scheme that was kept

384
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
Secret once he started cooperating with the feds

385
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,407
And this is something Jody Chris and his lawsuit says was a very big concern

386
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Inside Bay Rock

387
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
He says the firm did what it could to survive

388
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
From

389
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,087
Investors from Securities officials

390
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,647
And they were worried about it all the time

391
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
Which gets us to the final quest

392
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:42,143
Did Donald Trump know about Felix Sater conviction in the pump and dump scheme and his connection with the mob

393
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
Because if he did

394
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
At the least

395
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
He did something enough

396
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
And at the most

397
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
It's possible he broke the law

398
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
Okay so first

399
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
Here's why this could be a

400
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
Problem

401
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:09,023
Companies are required to tell investors if they have someone working for them who has a relevant felony can

402
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,095
Terry Crews lawsuit says bayrock

403
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Did Felix Sater

404
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Conviction

405
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
Somewhere

406
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,543
You said that if Trump worked closely with principal fundraisers at bayrock who hit this

407
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
It could be considered part of a conspiracy

408
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,943
Other lawyer say conspiracy would be a stretch

409
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,295
And they say there's no evidence that Trump was a principal fundraiser for bayrock

410
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,159
That is what would require him to disclose that your conviction

411
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
At the very least

412
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,279
If Trump knew about satyrs felony conviction and didn't disclose it

413
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,327
Most of the Lord's we talked you said

414
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
It's unethical

415
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,447
And it shows the kind of person Trump is willing to deal with

416
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,055
The Trump organization did not comment on this

417
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Or anything else

418
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Cinestory

419
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,455
So it is possible that from the time they met up until 2007

420
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,783
Donald Trump did not know about Felix satyrs Financial crime

421
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
That pump

422
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,575
Dump scheme.

423
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,599
He plead guilty to

424
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,951
His company does background checks as best as can

425
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,255
Either way the whole story broke

426
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,535
On December 17th

427
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
2007

428
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
The New York Times

429
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
Published an article about

430
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
And it told the story of the margarita glass

431
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
Pump and dump

432
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
The Stinger Miss

433
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
As for what happened next

434
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
A lawyer named Richard Lerner

435
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
The story from there

436
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
He's been involved in lawsuits against Bay Rock for years

437
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,247
And he has internal bayrock emails from that

438
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
I never filed as part of

439
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
Jody Kriss law

440
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:40,159
The New York Times articles published on December 17th 2007

441
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
2 Days Later

442
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
In the case of

443
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,607
Donald Trump against Tim O'Brien he was deposed

444
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,679
Yes you heard that right Donald Trump versus Tim O'Brien

445
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,751
The same Tim O'Brien from Bloomberg that you heard earlier

446
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
Like we said he has reported on Trump for years

447
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,383
And Trump sued him for defamation

448
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,759
In a deposition from that lawsuit Trump was asked whether he knew about Felix Sater conviction in the pump and dumps

449
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:09,343
Trump says nobody knew anything about him

450
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,695
An attorney asks have you severed your ties with the bayrock group as a result of this

451
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,999
Trump answers well I'm looking into it

452
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
Because I wasn't happy with the story

453
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,839
So I'm looking into it

454
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,911
That on January 21 2008

455
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,239
A few weeks later their internal emails

456
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
At Bay Rock

457
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
There's going to be a meeting

458
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
And Donald jr.

459
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
Ivanka

460
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
Eric

461
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,503
And Donald Trump senior coming

462
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,111
Julia Schwartz general counsel if a rock is coming say there will be there

463
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
That we don't

464
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,159
Know what that meeting was

465
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:49,023
But remember just five weeks earlier than New York Times have published that article.

466
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
Seder

467
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,655
In that email chain of January 21 2008

468
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,727
Leave the very final email of the day is

469
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
Quote Donald is happy with me

470
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
Felix Sater says

471
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:07,199
I'll explain when I see you

472
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
So in 2007

473
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Donald Trump says

474
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
I'm looking into

475
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
2008

476
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,976
Felix Sater writes Donald is happy with me and as recently as 2010 Felix Sater had a business car

477
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:23,328
It said senior advisor to Donald Trump the Trump organization

478
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,168
And in that Russian interview he gave last year later actually says

479
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,448
For 10 years

480
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
She reported quote

481
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
Everything to Trump

482
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,824
Sometimes twice a day sometimes twice a week

483
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
Sometimes twice a month

484
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,712
Then in 2013 Trump does this interview with the baby

485
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
PCS John Sweeney

486
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,296
Why didn't you go to feel excited and say

487
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
You connected with the mafia

488
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
You'll find

489
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,160
Well first of all we will not develop

490
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
That was a licensing deal

491
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,048
But your name is on that very simple licensing deal

492
00:21:54,816 --> 00:22:00,960
Did Trump give me but I don't know you're telling me things that I don't even know about I mean you're telling me about Felix Sater I know who he is

493
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,520
I know of him and I know who he is

494
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
You stayed

495
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
In bed

496
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
And I say so

497
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
With Felix Sater

498
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,664
And he was

499
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Connect

500
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,224
With the mafia gang John

501
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
Maybe you're sick

502
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,808
But when you have a signed contract

503
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,904
You can't in this country just break it sometimes will sign a deal

504
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,232
And the partner isn't as good as we'd like but that does happen

505
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,328
We should say contracts can be broken or renegotiate

506
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
And then from just ends the interview

507
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,032
And by the way John I hate to do this but I do have that big group of people waiting so I have

508
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,336
Abdullah

509
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
I said let me see your hands

510
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,320
The same year of his BBC interview in 2013

511
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,136
Trump is asked again about Felix Sater

512
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,256
In another deposition this one related to a bayrock property in Florida

513
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
Baidu

514
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
Here's a recording of some of that

515
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,680
I don't think he was connected to the mafia he got into a barroom fight

516
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:10,080
And Becky was supposedly very close to the government of the United States essay

517
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
Witness or something

518
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,176
He got into trouble cuz he got into a barroom fight

519
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,760
Which a lot of people do I don't cuz I don't drink

520
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:23,904
But you know again I don't know it very well but I don't think it was connected to the mafia

521
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,208
X 7 W Converse

522
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,488
Easter Seder

523
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,608
Over the years over the years if you could not many

524
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,936
If he were sitting in the room right now I really wouldn't know

525
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,728
What he look like

526
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:41,056
So when you say not many I mean is that

527
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:45,152
You can count that I know I wouldn't know what to say about that cuz I don't know you

528
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,688
He would call

529
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,760
I think it dealt mostly with my company not with me

530
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,344
This is how licensing deals work right

531
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
I just had my name on the phone

532
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
I wasn't involved

533
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,208
And the day today

534
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,304
Jody Crystal Tim O'Brien Trump was involved

535
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Day today

536
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,168
But even if Donald jr. shook your hand on a deal

537
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,472
He might come back downstairs to renegotiate

538
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
If his father told him to

539
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:23,808
Okay so how does any of this relate to Robert Mueller and the special investigation

540
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
It's whether the Trump campaign colluded with

541
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,720
We know from recent reports the investigation is broadening

542
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
To include

543
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
The financial dealings of trump and his

544
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:39,424
We know the team will be looking at contacts made during the development of trump Soho

545
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,032
Between Trump and his associates and any Russians who could later have been trying to influence the election

546
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,872
We know that Felix Sater has contacts in Russia

547
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,200
Where is families from the US government there

548
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,040
