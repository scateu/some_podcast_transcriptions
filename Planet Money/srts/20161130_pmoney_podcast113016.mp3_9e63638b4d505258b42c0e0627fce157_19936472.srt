Long before there were light bulbs

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,784
There was fat

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,184
For thousands of years if you wanted to light up your cave your mud-hut or if you were really lucky Your Castle

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,720
You had to find some fat

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,256
Something to use for a wick

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,560
Maybe some Moss maybe a piece of fabric

12
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840
Light it on fire

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
This was not easy

14
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,912
Even today

15
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,192
It's a hard way to get light

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,592
Yeah hi do you sell

17
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,384
Fat Moody fat

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
No

19
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,688
So I don't carry.

20
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,224
Okay thanks very much

21
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
A high

22
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
Giselle love

23
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,368
Fat like beef fat

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,648
Suet

25
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Okay

26
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,952
Thanks very much

27
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:08,096
Yeah hi I do sell beef fat how much is that

28
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
298

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,168
Okay great thanks very much you're welcome by

30
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
I got to lb

31
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,080
A big nasty lump of fat came from around the couch kidney

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,640
I got some twine from the hardware store

33
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,968
And I went home to my apartment to try and make candles

34
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,136
A little harder to catch up then

35
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
You might think

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,976
Sticks to itself

37
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,024
I put the fat on the stove

38
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
It's pretty melted

39
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
Smells

40
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
Really nasty

41
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,032
Animals nasty

42
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,360
Stranded then I started dipping the Wicks into it

43
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
Dipping dipping

44
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,272
You have to let the fat dry when you have to dip the wick some more

45
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
Dipping

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Was Eddie

47
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,880
I don't know 45 minutes or so of dip

48
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
Dip

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,256
I got kind of dip crazy in there

50
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
After hours of work

51
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,984
Not counting raising the cow or killing the cow or making the twine

52
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
I had six

53
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Piney

54
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Crooked

55
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
Smelly

56
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Candles

57
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,480
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob Goldstein and I'm David kestenbaum today on the show

58
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
Story of how we got from dim little candles made out of cow fat to as much light as we want at the flick of a switch and

59
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:41,280
I don't think I'm exaggerating here this one little story it explains why we are where we are today

60
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
People don't have to worry about starving today while we aren't all subsistence Farmers why we can't afford to have artists and massage

68
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,880
Jacob you brought these scraggly little candles in the office I'm holding him up here they look

69
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Gnarled

70
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,816
But definitely not straight and they're not like sleek

71
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
Now it looks like some mold has grown on a

72
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
On a string

73
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
My strength

74
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,520
So you brought these candles in the office here and we wanted to show them to

75
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
Expert

76
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
Sat down with this woman Jane brox

77
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Jane read a book

78
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Brilliant

79
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
The evolution of artificial light

80
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
So I made a few different candles

81
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
I tried

82
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,904
Beautiful Disaster

83
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,976
In the in the olden days

84
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,327
If a mother was trying to teach your daughter to make candles

85
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,191
She would not be pleased with his candle but we'll see what happens

86
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,775
I was afraid when we let these things that we might set off the fire alarm or

87
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,127
Sprinkler system in the office I mean that is how weird it is to have light from fire than

88
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,735
I was afraid we weren't going to be able to light him at all it's just be fat and Twine

89
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
But we pulled out a lighter

90
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,879
We have we have light

91
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
Should we see how long it lasts

92
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
It's not pretty but I'm very impressed

93
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,167
What colors would have been nice yellow flame wouldn't you say

94
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Doodieman a candle

95
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
Jane says that the Quest for this

96
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
Something that gives you light

97
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
After the sun goes down

98
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
Go people to do all kinds of

99
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
In the United States

100
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
In the Pacific Northwest

101
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Native Americans used

102
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
Dried

103
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
Salmon

104
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
Basically made a Salmon Canned

105
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,159
In the tropics people would catch fireflies and try to make

106
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Can a firefly Lantern

107
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
And then there's this bird

108
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Call the Petro

109
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
The storm Petrel

110
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
And then north of Scotland where they would just

111
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
At which is a very oily seabird

112
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,935
Which they catch and dry

113
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
And

114
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,543
Thread a wick down its throat and then light it and

115
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
The net was a lamp

116
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,919
Chiron a dead bird is that

117
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:43,039
And I would imagine they'd have a little storage area with a lot of dead

118
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
Storm Petrel

119
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
Martha we need another petrol

120
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,839
The petrol supply is getting low ways of making light where all

121
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
A huge house

122
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
They took a lot of work

123
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,983
It was not just that I didn't know what I was doing when I made those candles

124
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,799
Writer Harriet Beecher Stowe said

125
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,103
Making candles from animal fat with

126
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,663
7 times as bad as washing clothes

127
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Let me think about it you got to get a cow

128
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,087
You got a raise the calorie going to have food to feed the cow you got to kill the cow you got to get the fat out of the couch

129
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
You got to put the fat in your Cuisinart

130
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
Which isn't going to be invented for a hundred years

131
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:28,095
From an economic perspective if you want to try to quantify how much of a pain in the butt it is to make something or at least

132
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
How hard is it to get that thing

133
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
You can ask a simple

134
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
How much does it

135
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
It cost

136
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,799
Bill nordhaus Anaconda Misty yellow while back got obsessed

137
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,919
He decided he wanted to calculate exactly how expensive light was

138
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Thousands of year

139
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
And how that caused change

140
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,087
Because light you know light is this thing Society has needed and sought

141
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Forever

142
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
It was a way to track progress

143
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,695
Not just in light but in all kinds of thing

144
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,999
Unfortunately in order to do this

145
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,839
He needed to know how much things cost thousands of years ago

146
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
Like an ancient Babylon

147
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
It was even true those numbers existed

148
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
But they did

149
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,751
I ran into a woman that yeah

150
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,591
And she believe it or not she is just

151
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Unbelievable actually

152
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,455
She actually had wage data and price data

153
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
From

154
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
The Babylonian era

155
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
4000 years ago

156
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,671
Now he has these numbers but he needs to know one other thing

157
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
How much light are people getting for their money

158
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
In ancient Babylon people used lamps

159
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
4 light

160
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
So nordhaus

161
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Decided to make

162
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,703
I did this in my dining room

163
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Where else

164
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,799
Devised an ancient style lamp from a catalog he gets it burning

165
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:45,407
Measure how bright it is he borrows a light meter from a facility sky at Yale

166
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Andy

167
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
Does some science

168
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:52,319
And that would just make sure it didn't write it down to just the way you see in the

169
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,671
In the old movies are some guy with men is lab coat running down the measurements

170
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Jacob

171
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:02,303
I'd little note here I happen to be taking nordhaus is economics class right around this time

172
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,863
Which I was a was a pretty serious like no-nonsense

173
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:09,471
Class and it's so funny for me to think that the night he was going home and measuring ancient

174
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,775
Lamp placement is dining room with a lightning

175
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:17,151
Who does this the light meter the ancient lamp

176
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,759
You have to figure out a way to compare the price of light over thousands of years

177
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
So here's one measure heat

178
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
If you take a day's wait

179
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
You work all day you take all the money or

180
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
And you spend it on

181
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
How many minutes

182
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
Could you light up a small

183
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
With as much light as you get

184
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Today's modern

185
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
Your dancer for ancient battle

186
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
Maybe 10 minutes

187
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
It was really

188
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
An entire day's wages got you the equivalent of

189
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,383
10 minutes of light from a kind of dim light bulb

190
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
Economist talked a lot about productivity

191
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
How much one person

192
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,575
And back then the answer was not much

193
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
Everything was hard

194
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
Growing food was hard

195
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,207
Making candles for instance took hours

196
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,231
Use of fat

197
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,559
Fat which by the way was expensive because raising animals

198
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,423
This was a world where when the sun went down almost everyone lived in the dark

199
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,263
And this might sound sort of romantic but basically it was awful

200
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,847
The dark was not some beautiful thing you went out and explored

201
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
It was dangerous

202
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
What's something that trapped

203
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,735
In Paris at one point it was actually a law that said

204
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:29,855
Every night everybody has to give their keys to a magistrate go home and lock themselves in the house

205
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
For basically 4000 years

206
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
Very little hot

207
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
With light

208
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,743
Are we the economy in general

209
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
Most people work all day

210
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
Naked women

211
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
The way things get better

212
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
The way an economy grows the way people get richer

213
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Where is that

214
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Someone

215
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
Comes up with a better way to do something

216
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
A way to take a little less work

217
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,383
Overtime there are small improvements in life

218
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
And in light

219
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,991
The Romans figure out how to make a lamp that's a little more efficient

220
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,111
People start use whale oil this of course is very very bad for whales but

221
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,671
Wheels have a lot of fat they were like these big

222
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Swimming sources

223
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
The fuel

224
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,791
Still even when you get all the way to the 1700

225
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,631
Like still looks more like ancient Babylon than the modern world

226
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,983
People still travel the same way by foot by horse by sailing ship

227
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,031
Most people are still subsistence farmers

228
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
Usually living in some kind of Hut

229
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,871
Trying to grow enough food not to starve to death

230
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
Yorkshire are there are tiny games in product

231
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Little bits of acne

232
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
But not a lot

233
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
And Light

234
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,855
Light still comes from finding stuff that's flying around in

235
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Lighting it on fire

236
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
Again Economist Bill Nord

237
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
You look at the picture

238
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,511
Love what happened here

239
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
Its economic history in a nutshell

240
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
From Babylonian time to round 1800

241
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,727
They were even though that were improvements as best we can tell

242
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
They were very modest

243
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,103
And then around 1800 in the lighting you can see it so clearly and Lighting

244
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
Just a

245
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Enormous change

246
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
In the pace

247
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Of improvement

248
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,295
What happens in the 1800's is

249
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
A few things

250
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,367
We start to really actively Xperia

251
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
We try to discover

252
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
And around 1850 a guy in Canada

253
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,327
Comes up with something that's not just a slightly better Wick or a slightly more efficient lamp

254
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
It is this magical liquid

255
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,935
With the right techniques you can get it from cold

256
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Royal

257
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
This big breakthrough

258
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Heresy

259
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,591
Not cutting-edge now but back then Jane boxes

260
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,895
Kerosene was a huge deal

261
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,711
When the first kerosene lamps came out it was

262
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
As one historian said it was

263
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,575
Kind of oil people have dreamed about for centuries

264
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
It was brighter it was cleaner

265
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
And importantly

266
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
It was much cheaper

267
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
You work a day you got

268
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
About an hour

269
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
Whale oil

270
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
Kerosene

271
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
You get

272
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
About

273
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
5 hours

274
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
Wow so it's about

275
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
5 *

276
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,591
More efficient

277
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
Kerosene

278
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
Let the world and save the whales

279
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
So if kerosene was so great

280
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
Why did it take the world so long to find

281
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Science

282
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:15,231
This idea of professional scientists this idea that there are lots of people who go to work every day at universe

283
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
Mercedes and do experiments

284
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
In the 1800 this is still a new thing

285
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,679
If you happen to be president of Yale University this is around the time when you're thinking you know

286
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
Maybe we should get one of those

287
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
Science

288
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,591
Why what why would they doing those experiments a century earlier

289
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,711
Well you didn't have scientists A Century earlier they would teaching Greek

290
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
General teaching logic

291
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,319
Now all the scientists are working on better ways to make light

292
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
And life is getting cheaper

293
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
More people are using it

294
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,463
No more locking yourself in and huddling in the dark all night

295
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511
Around this time streetlight starpop

296
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
People start going out at night

297
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
So we have kerosene what's the next big Advance after that

298
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,191
Okay next big Advance after that is

299
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
The electric lamp

300
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
The big one

301
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,055
Well you might think so

302
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
Cheetah Jacob I thought I knew the story of the Lipo

303
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
Call Pino Thomas Edison the great inventor

304
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
Story about science and Innovation unit

305
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:14,111
Trying all these different filaments these different designs and finally getting one little glow for hours but

306
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,183
This Eureka lightbulb moment it is not

307
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
It's not enough to get you to the world of really cheap light

308
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
Cuz Edison needed this other thing

309
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
He needed money she needed a lot

310
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
And lots of money

311
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Why

312
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
You can't light a light bulb without electricity

313
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
He needed to build a power plant

314
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,711
Right now where the location of the original Power Plant in lower Manhattan this is Paul Israel he's an

315
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
Edison scholar we met him here in New York City

316
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
We're standing in front of this

317
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Plaque

318
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,135
Thomas Alva Edison in big letters

319
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
There's this picture

320
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,791
And the image of a show is the generator room of the power

321
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,607
With a bunch of guys in a really long mustaches

322
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,167
This is 1882

323
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
So what's of mustaches

324
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,335
The money part of building a power plant is so important that when they finally get this historic thing

325
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
Completed in 1882 they get the power play

326
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
My bill

327
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
And they're ready to turn it on

328
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
Edison is not here

329
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,807
He's a few blocks away as a big impressive stonebwoy

330
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
Where today there is another plaque

331
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
You may have heard of

332
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
JP Morgan

333
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
It reads

334
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
The capitalist capitalist

335
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
Known throughout the world of Finance

336
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
Sought out by presidents

337
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Helped

338
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
Bankroll the industrialization

339
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Can write that I'm too many people

340
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
JP Morgan Bank and a bunch of investors

341
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
They put up money for

342
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
The power plant

343
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,871
Pretty clear they built this great big expensive comp

344
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
Placated power station

345
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:45,247
First Central Power Station in the world right basically inventing

346
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Electric light

347
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
And when they turn it on Edison is not there

348
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
Right he was

349
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,743
Where he needed to be with the people who had funded the whole thing right

350
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,327
Show 3 p.m. on September 4th Edison flipped on the switch

351
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
Here at JP Morgan's office

352
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
And what happened

353
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
It went on

354
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
Acid lights all over the disk

355
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
Bar square mile of lower Manhattan

356
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
Subway

357
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Was lit by Electra

358
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
You think of Edison the inventor

359
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
But even more important

360
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Is Edison the businessman

361
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,295
At the time buildings in lower Manhattan were running off gas light

362
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
Edison knew that was who we had to

363
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
We spent a lot of time thinking about economic

364
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,975
Notebooks

365
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,095
Constantly he's going through and comparing the cost of what he's doing to what the cost

366
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
You never think about that

367
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
Well and that's what made him such a good innovator

368
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
Right casino

369
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
You recognize that

370
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,871
These economic questions were just as important

371
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
In designing what he did in Labrador

372
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,015
When you think of economic growth how much do you think of it is coming from like

373
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:55,647
Individual like Eureka moments and inventions and stuff like that and how much is it to stuff around it

374
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
Likeability Define enticing

375
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
The economic structure

376
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
So most of it is actually the structure around

377
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,679
Light a square mile of lower Manhattan Edison needed the whole financial system

378
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
Do you need a patent

379
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,519
A way to protect his ideas so no one would steal them

380
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Uneeda doll company

381
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:17,663
Away a bunch of different investors could come together and risk money a lot of money

382
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
To build a power plant

383
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,759
Play wire so you can try this crazy thing

384
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
Light Without fire

385
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,623
Edison comes along at a time when all this machinery

386
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
Patents corporations Banks is in place

387
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
They were consequences

388
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
Aminos first power plants burn coal

389
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
And pollution was pretty bad

390
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:40,447
Edison built a huge power plant on the east side of Manhattan and at some point the City Health Department got involved and

391
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
Is according

392
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
New York Times quote

393
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
When it was found Health Department men were trying to photograph the smokestacks Scouts were put on the company's roof ordered the feeding

394
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
King of Cole stopped whenever photographers of

395
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,271
The other hand you know how to City lit up with cheap electric

396
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Trade off

397
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
Around this time everything is getting faster

398
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Cheaper

399
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,183
Scientist keep making new discoveries

400
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,231
You get the internal combustion engine

401
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
The tractor

402
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,327
For the first time in human history most people don't have to work as farmers

403
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,655
This went on decade after decade all through the 20th century

404
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
All continents got much cheaper

405
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Like light

406
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
And if you look at the

407
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,799
Really long Arc here it's

408
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,615
It's amazing me go all the way back to the battle on

409
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Okay

410
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,407
Babylonians

411
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,711
You worked all day you got the equivalent of

412
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
10 minutes

413
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
10 minutes of light

414
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,855
4000 years later in the 19th century with kerosene lamps

415
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Things are better

416
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Day labor gets you five hours

417
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,279
And by the time nordhaus does his light study in the 1990s

418
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
If you work today

419
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
How much light do you get

420
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
Maybe 20 thousand

421
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,703
20000 hours

422
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,031
20000 hours

423
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,359
I mean you basically you you have your

424
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:57,247
You have your house lit up you have your streets lit up you have your all your

425
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:01,087
Equipment on you have your air conditioner on your all the stuff you're doing is

426
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,183
Are saturated with lighting the main thing is your statue look like

427
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Economic growth isn't all good

428
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
There's pollution their environmental consequences

429
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
But fundamentally

430
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
Growth is about things getting faster

431
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Getting cheaper

432
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
Getting more efficient

433
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
About doing the same amount of work

434
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
And being able to buy

435
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
20000 hours

436
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,335
Of light instead of 10 minutes

437
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,895
And as a result about being able to work less

438
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,711
What to buy other stuff that used to be just for the wealthy

439
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
We can buy books

440
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
We can take vacation

441
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,599
Even today there are still people who go to work everyday

442
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
Try to figure out how to make a better light bulb

443
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:40,511
This morning I went to

444
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,559
The ball Factory for about an hour

445
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,887
This is John Edmund is one of the founders of a company called

446
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:50,495
Creed they make LED light bulbs which of course are much more efficient than regular

447
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,103
You'll make you'll try an experiment you'll say holy crap we just got

448
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
More light out of this thing

449
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
By using

450
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,991
This contact material or flipping the chip over

451
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,063
Jacob when we talk about economic growth every year you know one

452
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
When we say the economy grew a couple percent

453
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
That happens because every day out there

454
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
Someone somewhere in some corner of the

455
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,047
He has figured out how to do something a little bit better

456
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
Where are a little bit fast

457
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Our little blessings

458
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,703
And this process is going on year after year for hundreds of years

459
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,287
I want question I always have it when I think about this is like

460
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
And not just with light

461
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,103
But this whole story of constant

462
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
Economic growth

463
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,479
My question is is it going to go on forever

464
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
Or some point we going to run out of ways to make things

465
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
We might

466
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
We might double from where we are now

467
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
But we're not going to be triple and quadruple

468
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
Cuz there are physical limit

469
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,767
Iowa cargo many miles an hour now

470
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
It just won't it just it's not going to happen

471
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
For the light bulb at least Johnson

472
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,935
We may actually be near

473
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
