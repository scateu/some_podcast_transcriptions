Took all of that away from me

22
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
And so begins

00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
The great parable

24
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,880

Everything is going really well for Louis winthorpe until his bosses

65
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,616
They have an argument about nature versus nurture

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,920
And the evil Randolph Duke that's his

67
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,992
Maybe even slightly more evil brother Mortimer Duke

68
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,040
That he can take away Lewis's job

69
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320

His job

He's home his Butler

80
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,240
And they try to turn him

81
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,288
Into a Hotshot Commodities broker

82
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,616
It's kind of a modern-day Twist on Prince and the Pauper

83
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
Guinea pigs they find each other

84
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,992
And Lewis and Billy Ray conspire to get back at

85
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
The Dukes

86
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,808
And they make a brilliant plan to make themselves

87
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Really rich

88
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,856
And put the Duke

89
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
Brothers in The Pour House at the same time

90
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
It is a crazy complicated plan involves Futures Trading on Commodities and cornering the market

91
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,608
And Frozen concentrated

92
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Orange juice

93
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
Right there that's my first question

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,728
Frozen concentrated orange juice

95
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
Central to the move and when I first thought

96
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
I totally thought that was made up as a

97
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
Justin Bieber

98
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
Funny in the real world

99
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
My thinking was

100
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
You just trade oranges

101
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,480
Who would spend their life

102
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,296
Trading little cans of Frozen concentrated Orange

103
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
I found somebody

104
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
This guy

105
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,184
My name is time for honest and I'm a commodity Trader

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720

00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
Where I can have spent the last 4 hours

109
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
Buying and selling orange juice options

110
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
And futures

111
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
It's real

112
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,287
It's totally real estate doesn't all day long

113
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,151
Tumblr oldest you can be a first expert on all things Frozen

114
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
Healthy orange

115
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,479
Just a moment

116
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
We're going to use both of them to fact-check

117
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
This premise

118
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
That you had Ramen

119
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,367
The Trading Places

120
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,695
Basically could be a university-level course

122
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487

Explains economics

125
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,607
For a living I mean this is my job I take

126
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
My hat off

127
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
To the writers of this movie

128
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
Just listen to this scene

129
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
The Duke Brothers in the scene

130
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
Lead Eddie Murphy Delirious Valentine

131
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
Wood table and settlement table

132
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
It's a beautiful day

133
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
This is not

134
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Emil.

135
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
We are here to try

136
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,391
Explain to you what it is we do here

137
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
We are Commodities brokers

138
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,023
What are commodities

139
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
Commodities are agricultural

140
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,095
Products

141
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Like

142
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Coffee

143
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
For breakfast

144
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,239
Sweet which is used to make bread

145
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Pork belly

146
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Which is used to make

147
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Bacon

148
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,151
Which you might find in a bacon and lettuce and tomato sandwich

149
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
Exoduspoint Eddie Murphy

150
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,575
Just deadpans right into the camera I suspect it sometimes Planet Money list

151
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
Clear so far

152
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
Reviewing the movie they really really did a good job I mean someone

153
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Inet

154
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
Knew what they were doing

155
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
This is our second expert

156
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Bob Lassen Trello

157
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
He's a Commodities Trader in Chicago

158
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
He used to trade cattle futures

159
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,383
Like Roman you might find any roast beef

160
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
Cheddar and tomato sandwich

161
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087
Of course if you watch that scene you might think of these guys trade-in physical things the physical things that you see on the table.

162
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
Bacon the weed

163
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
The cans of orange juice

164
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,975
Baton Brian says that in that words use Market that's not quite right

165
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,583
Yes Duffy. Store just a little can't you have to probably have large refrigerator type units for them

166
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,167
What do you mean probably you buy and sell the stuff you have no idea what it looks like

167
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,007
No and as a matter of fact if you trade agricultural Commodities most

168
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,615
Commodity Traders go their whole careers without ever seeing the physical product am I used

169
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
Trade pork bellies and live Hogs and

170
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
I would know a pork belly fat dropped on the table here

171
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,575
Yeah the recent Tom peronace wouldn't recognize the pork belly on the table

172
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,903
It's because people like him who do this in real life or Trading

173
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Contract

174
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
I'm pork belly

175
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Or technically

176
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,071
The future promise to deliver a certain amount of pork bellies at a certain

177
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
I'm at a certain price

178
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:05,727
But it really is a it's a wager it's a bet on whether you think something is going to go up or down in price and

179
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
Mortimer and Randolph Duke in the movie

180
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
They make money

181
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
Whether it goes up or down

182
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,151
That's a good part William is that

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
Matter whether our clients

184
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Make money

185
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
I lose money

186
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
Duke and Duke

187
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
Commission

188
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Well

189
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
Do you think Valentine

190
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
Sounds to me like you guys are

191
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
I told you he'd understand

192
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,191
I know this whole contract thing may seem theoretical

193
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,287
But the bats are based on an actual contract when an actual real thing

194
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,871
The prettiest just hold the contract for just a few minutes or a few days

195
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
Enough time to make a little money

196
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
But before the contract

197
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Expire

198
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,271
Any actual good have to be delivered

199
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,831
That Trader needs to unload the car

200
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
Need to sell to someone who actually

201
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Wants

202
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
Thing underneath the car

203
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Contract to actually wants

204
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
The oranges

205
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Who wants to bake

206
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Wants

207
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
The lighthouse

208
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Remember that's what Bob Last Cinderella traded in

209
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Live cattle futures

210
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
18:1

211
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,519
How he just wanted to make a bet on the future prices of

212
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
But once popped

213
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
Did you ever receive an actual cow

214
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
Oh boy did I

215
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
Yeah not a cow 40 of them

216
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,111
And more than 40 you made a mistake yes

217
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,975
You made a mistake and somebody called you on the phone and just said we have

218
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
I don't hear from you wear them

219
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Oh yeah

220
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:38,655
Are there in the pain directly off the truck and in the pain is what it is and so

221
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:43,263
When the guys in the East st. Louis Stockyards found out that a Futures Trader took delivery on

222
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,591
Some cattle they generally aren't super helpful about

223
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
They don't really give you a hand letting you

224
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,479
Song they think they kind of stick you with some extra fees and

225
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
You know babe babe

226
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
They don't like us guys they picked it in Athens

227
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
It's Times Like These Guys

228
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
Sort of meddling in their world

229
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Now back to the Moon

230
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
Billy Ray Valentine

231
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255
Who is now called William Bell

232
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559

Well that turns out he has some Talent

00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
Because it's not just about knowing the facts and the figures

235
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
The contracts

236
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Commodities

237
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,263
A lot of it is about knowing psychology

238
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
Tell me just quiet

239
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Price of pork bellies

240
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871

00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Okay

249
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,095
The people on the park by the contractor going batshit

250
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,399
Hey

251
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,727
Christmas is around the corner

252
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
Kung Fu grip

253
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
Okay and my wife ain't going

254
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
My wife want to make love to

255
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
Because I got no money right

256
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
This is Nanny Pat

257
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
Screaming

258
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
I can feel it

259
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Department

260
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
Oh my God

261
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,719
I wait till you get to about 60 for the night by

262
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
If it at all the second about it

263
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Of course

264
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
Billy Ray Valentine makes them a ton of money

265
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
Table Cinderella has a small quibble with this

266
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
He says people don't really declare up

267
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,263
Particular price for a commodity no one ever says

268
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
It's going to 64 I don't really know exact

269
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,223
But people make bets on whether things just go up and down is that right two people just have hunches

270
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
Absolutely I mean what would happen

271
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
You know

272
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Their guys would just

273
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:38,207
You'd be standing around and you'd have to start to have a feeling that the market was going to go up or down and then you would trade accordingly

274
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
It's sort of like

275
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Your brain

276
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
Processing all this information

277
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
Ends up

278
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Manifesting itself as

279
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
What's called the field

280
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
And then you buy resale accordingly

281
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
So far according to RX

282
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
The Movie Trading Places

283
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,383
Is nailing it they have Commodities thing down pat

284
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,247
But then it gets a little Hollywood Lewis Winthrop are down and out Rich Boy

285
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
He teams up with his former Butler

286
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
And a prostitute

287
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
With a heart of gold

288
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
We did not

289
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
Check that one you don't even need to

290
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
It's a given

291
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Exactly

292
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
Billy Ray the con man turned trading savant

293
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
Figures out

294
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
I've been played

295
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
A joint up with Winthrop and

296
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Hatch this plant

297
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
Make millions of dollars

298
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Bankrupt

299
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
And it's the end of the movie where I have my biggest question

300
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
I was a kid I saw it and

301
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
I know that

302
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,919
Something important is happening on the trading floor at the end

303
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
The Underdogs win

304
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
I get rich

305
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
The Dukes go bankrupt

306
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,343
But I didn't really understand it and I when I watch it again

307
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
The funny thing is

308
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:45,279
Still don't really understand it as an adult and I don't think I would have got it

309
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,375
But I have now study the movie over again we talk to The Experts

310
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
And we are going to break

311
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
This thing.

312
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,263
Because Roman if you were paying attention

313
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
This movie has already talked

314
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
Do everything you need to know about commodities

315
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
And how to Corner the market

316
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
Now

317
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
Remember the orange

318
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
That was in the breakfast

319
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Yes

320
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Frozen concentrated or

321
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
Okay so in the movie The Duke Brothers

322
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,903
Have bribed the guy to get an advance copy of the

323
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,439
Neuropathy

324
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,279
Copy of the USDA orange crop report

325
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,119
Which of the totally real things cop reports come out every month to tell you how much

326
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Commodity is out there

327
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,215
Now this if they know it in advance

328
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
How many oranges are out there

329
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
They will then know whether the price

330
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
It's going to go up or down

331
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Remember understand

332
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
And the crop report

333
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,687
Is going to say that the supply of oranges

334
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
Is fine

335
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Plenty of good

336
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Cheap orange juice

337
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
Just go around at the normal day in the market

338
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,623
Except our heroes are going to trick

339
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
The Duke Brothers

340
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
They're going to pull the old switcheroo

341
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
So they slip the brothers

342
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
Baked crappie

343
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,559
A report that says

344
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,655
Oh my god there was this terrible Frost in Florida lots of dead oranges

345
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Fake report would make

346
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
Any Savvy Trainor no

347
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
Price of orange juice is going to go through the

348
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
Saudi Brothers think

349
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
Supplies low

350
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
Want to go out

351
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,943
And they're willing to bet everything on it

352
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,735
They are so long

353
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
Iraq

354
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,087
Our Heroes Billy Ray Valentine and Louis winthorpe

355
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
Former Trader got screwed by the Duke

356
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
They know the truth

357
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
They know that the orange Supply is fine

358
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
And they know

359
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
What did the prices going to go down

360
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:27,679
Silver Spring back roj expert Tom peronace and we're going to watch this final scene together and get a play-by-play

361
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,871
Our Heroes with their stolen Insider information our heroes are

362
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
Driving out onto the trading floor

363
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
Of the New York Mercantile

364
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,783
There's my old place of employment

365
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
That's the World Trade Center

366
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,647
I'd office in that building right there that's that's for the exchange was

367
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
Inside you see all the traitors in there

368
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
A grievous

369
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
Gathering on this large floor staring up at

370
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Set the clock

371
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,751
And it's pandemonium

372
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
Tom says this is exactly what was like before computers

373
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,663
Maybe not quite so many people excited about frozen orange juice but still

374
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
Does make me nostalgic for floor-based trading

375
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,367
Now once again Roman got to keep all these things in your head if this give except

376
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,439
The Duke Brothers think there's going to be a shortage of Orange

377
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
Because according to their fake crop report

378
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
Harvest will be back

379
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
The prices should go up

380
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
They tell their guy their Floor Trader

381
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,959
I want you to buy as much OJ as you can in the instant pot

382
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,263
Don't worry if the price starts going up

383
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,127
Play starts at $1.02 a pound

384
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Best Buy

385
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,247
Play stick to go up and up their bidding up the price of orange juice

386
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
And the rest of the traitors

387
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Start to notice

388
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,695
They know something I can feel it Let's Get It On

389
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
Okay I got to tell you here Roman

390
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
But the actor who says

391
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
They know something I can feel it

392
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
That is Jack Davidson

393
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,191
Father of Planet money's very old Adam Davis

394
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
And as I will say really is

395
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:11,359
It really is the most critical line in the entire movement delivered by his father

396
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
That's amazing

397
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,967
What is universally important for the plot because

398
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,319
Everyone starts to buy oranges the price was higher and higher at Dollar 10

399
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
A dollar $28 30

400
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
Everyone now thinks there is an orange

401
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Shortage

402
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
The only problem

403
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Is

404
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
We know at the audience that's based on a lot

405
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,607
So Billy Ray Valentine Louis winthorpe stand quietly

406
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,655
In The Madness of the trading floor round

407
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,495
They know the price is too high they know it's getting higher

408
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,543
And I know it's about to collapse

409
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
And so they want to do a little trick

410
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
A product called Short Selling

411
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
They want to sell orange juice while the prices

412
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Hi

413
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
So

414
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,551
When the price hits 142

415
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
Dan Aykroyd looks

416
00:15:54,111 --> 00:16:00,255
And he screams and I think

417
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:05,119
Is a good candidate for the second most important line of the movie with all respect to Jack Davidson

418
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
And I totally

419
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,471
Mystic Ivory watch that movie again and again I have no idea

420
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
What he says they're what

421
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
Dan Aykroyd says there

422
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Do we have time explained

423
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
Sell 30 April 142

424
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,967
What you doing you selling 30 Futures contracts at a price of 142 per pound

425
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,831
And there's kind of a Feeding Frenzy driving the market higher but these guys

426
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,671
Have what they believe is the real information and they're selling it at rally

427
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,255
So selling it to the rally means you think the price is going to go down

428
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Yes

429
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
I'm starting to get this

430
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,655
Billy Ray Lewis they're selling High they're selling orange juice

431
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,727
To everyone who thinks that is going to go even higher than that

432
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
Yeah it's a really tricky

433
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
Find point

434
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
Here but I'm just going to say this

435
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
You don't have to

436
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Own any orange juice

437
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
In order to sell it

438
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
Because

439
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,575
They're selling a promise they're selling this thing I will

440
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,903
Promise to deliver you orange juice in April that was a part of that

441
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,207
And you will pay me this large amount of money

442
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Sometime in the

443
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,535
Our Heroes have until then

444
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,327
Find some cheap orange juice

445
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
Center fielder contract

446
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,191
If you heard of the old saying like Buy Low and sell High

447
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
Yes that one I know

448
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
It's

449
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,335
Turns out though and this is the key to short side but keep the entire movie

450
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
Is you can do it

451
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
The other way

452
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
You can sell High first

453
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,759
And then turn around quickly and Bi-Lo make

454
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Ton of money

455
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,087
Aunt our heroes are about

456
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,671
Get to buy extremely low because the crop report

457
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
The real crop report

458
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
Is about to come out

459
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,071
It's kind of crazy cuz everyone on the tree Ford to stop

460
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
And what's the TV

461
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
Ladies and gentlemen

462
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
The orange crop estimate

463
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
For the next year

464
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,919
And I mean this is obviously a Hollywood moment prater's don't really just stare the TV and there's not a long awkward pause while the Secretary of

465
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Agriculture

466
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,807
This is dramatic tension Robert

467
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,623
After calculating the estimates from

468
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,415
Various artists producing states

469
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
We have concluded the following

470
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,071
The cold winter has apparently not affected the orange Harvest

471
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,663
That sound you hear is a bunch of people who just realize that they bet the wrong way but there's no shortage

472
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
The Dukes

473
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,503
And everyone who bought with them including Adams dad

474
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
Now own a lot of various

475
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
Expensive Orange

476
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Way too expensive

477
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,903
Another real proper Port is out

478
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,207
The price is dropping its 102

479
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,999
96 it's plunging to

480
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:44,095
7264 everyone who bought high now wants to sell

481
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
And cut their losses

482
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,423
And it's driving the price down even further

483
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Now 46

484
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
And remember our

485
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Gyros

486
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,543
I knew this was going to happen

487
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,871
They sold a ton of orange juice at a crazy high price

488
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
And now the entire

489
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,223
Trading floor including the Duke Brothers

490
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
Guitar Floyd's begging

491
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,551
To sell them orange juice

492
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
For Crazy Cheap

493
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,487
If yours were a hero skip

494
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
At the kiosk

495
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
Other people have promised to buy orange juice from them

496
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,167
At a price as high as 142

497
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
142

498
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,031
And a minute later people are promising to sell orange juice to them

499
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
As cheap as

500
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
$0.29 a pound

501
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
Billy Ray and Lewis

502
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
Get the pocket

503
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
It is a

504
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,039
Epic move probably a significantly bigger one day move in the orange

505
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
Cheese market has ever had in

506
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,343
Entire history

507
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,903
A purely fictional move but you know

508
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,487
And enough to enable these guys to retire handsome

509
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,559
We had our Commodities guys watchthisfree closely

510
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
But it's hard to estimate

511
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,679
Just how much money Billy Ray and Louis made on the scam

512
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,983
We see the price of orange juice futures

513
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
But not how many contra

514
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
That's all we know at the end of the movie is that the Duke Brothers

515
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
They are Bank

516
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,967
Yeah they bought all of that orange juice when he was a crazy high prices they bought High

517
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,527
And if and when they sell it it's going to be

518
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
A terribly low prices they did the

519
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
The opposite

520
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
Of what you need to do to make money in the market

521
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,207
They lost nearly 400 million dollar

522
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
Bars in the way trading works

523
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
I hear is probably pocketed most

524
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
And as far as villains

525
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,631
The Dukes they get their comeuppance

526
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
At the end of trading

527
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,543
Turns out they borrowed a lot of that money they do

528
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,311
Just lost

529
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
Margin Call gentlemen

530
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:37,759
Can expect The Exchange accounts to be settled at the end of the day

531
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Trading

532
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Without

533
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:45,951
You know perfectly well we don't have 394 million dollars in cash

534
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:52,607
Put the Juke brother seats on Exchange up for sale at once seized all assets of Duke and Dubuque

535
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
Randolph and

536
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
And this

537
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
Traumatic

538
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,359
Crazy clearly Hollywood ending bad guys lose everything they get

539
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
Booted out of the rich

540
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
Positions in the market

541
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,271
This really happened sometimes according to Tom

542
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
He said people would borrow money

543
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
All

544
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
On the market move

545
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,672
And when I went the opposite direction

546
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Better pay up

547
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,280
Most clearinghouses had people who are referred to as leg break

548
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,096
They weren't like a real

549
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:30,496
Mobster you know leg Breakers but the they were the ones who say alright you know the time to Pony up alright well you know we want your house

550
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
House we want your IRA

551
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
I would happen right there on the floor

552
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,224
That's a little over dramatized but if it happened that day or the next day and other wouldn't be much of a time lag

553
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,272
He said there's one more unrealistic

554
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
At least in today's world

555
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Computer Trading

556
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,624
Took over the Commodities Market

557
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,160
That climactic scene

558
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,232
If they remade the movie today it would sound a lot like

559
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Like this

560
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,608
Tall people staring at screens

561
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,168
Today you know it is kind of

562
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
Obvious trauma is gone from

563
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
It would be a very quiet

564
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:08,896
Yes climactic Kelly and brothers will be in their own private hell you know looking at a computer screen

565
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,688
Head buried in their hands

566
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:17,088
Tom perona says and this makes me very happy that people still bring up the movie when he says he trades an orange juice futures

567
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,648
And even among his fellow traitors as a sort of

568
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Reverence

569
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
It's for the movie

570
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,768
The lines from the script I become part of the lingo of Commodities Trader

571
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,424
Definitely some of these these lines to become stock phrases like over the years especially the ocean market Upper people say like sell Mortimer sell

572
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,448
Amor De Verano

573
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,008
Duke and Duke is buying as I've heard that

574
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
20 * 2 count

575
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,360
Yeah. It's definitely become part of the boj lure

576
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:46,528
There wasn't much OJ Lord had scooped the first place but the

577
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,344
The stuff from Trading Places makes up a significant chunk of it

578
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,720
After the break how Trading Places made its Mark not just in Commodities lower

579
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
But in Commodities law

580
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,240
Support for this NPR Podcast in the following message come from the United States Postal Service

Everyday

582
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,080
Innovative companies are Reinventing the way business app

583
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
But none of that is possible without the right people

584
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:17,504
People who get packages to over a hundred and fifty million delivery play

585
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,856
Affordably and on time with the latest technology and expertise

586

Who can help you deliver the future of Commerce

587
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:31,072
The United States Postal Service see why they deliver more e-commerce packages to homes than anyone in the

588
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,400
Country at USPS.com future

589
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,472
You know what I always assume

590
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,032
Deepest hole scam with illegal

591
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,616
Are you hoes basically stole inside information

592
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
They stole the crop

593
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,688
Report

594
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992
They took all this money not just from the Duke

595
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
But

596
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
From the market

597
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
Edit the end

598
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,880
They're sitting on a Caribbean Beach

599
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,416
And I thought oh

600
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,208
They're on the Run

601
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
From the law

602
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
But it turns out

603
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,584
At the time

604
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,936
Insider trading was not strictly illegal in the commodities

605
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Trying to make

606
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,592
Sense because there's so many people involved if you are a farmer training corn

607
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,408
You have the ultimate inside information about corn

608
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
Everyone in the agriculture

609
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:21,760
Business as a little something that someone else doesn't

610
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,576
But it's the part where they steal a crop report

611
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:29,184
That seems way way over the line the actual fact

612
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,232
Of the suitcase which happens

613
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
In iMovie

614
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:38,656
You shouldn't steal which is illegal in every respect but the actual way in which they made money with stolen in

615
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
Information

616
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,752
That was legal and I learn this

617
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,824
Because when Congress was coming up with the banking

618
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
Warm light. Frank

619
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
In 2010

620
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,944
They were debating what should be in the billing

621
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,968
Emmett came up

622
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Special

623
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Provision

624
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
It seems that the chair of the

625
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Commodities

626
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,832
Future trading committee

627
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
Gary Gensler

628
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,904
He said we need this thing

629
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
It is called

630
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
The Eddie Murphy

631
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
A rule

632
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,048
It will make what happened to Trading Places

633
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
And it made it in

634
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,400
Dodd-Frank section 7 for 6

635
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,960
Federal employee can't

636
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,056
Leaked information about the price of a commodity so that someone can make money off of it

637
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,616
And a person who gets that leaked information

638
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,920
They can't use that to make money off of the mark

639
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,552
For this rule went into effect

640
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,880
What Eddie Murphy Billy Ray Valentine and Dan Aykroyd

641
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,416
North Winthrop the 3rd

642
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,000
But they did misappropriate information and then use it

643
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,536
Corner the orange juice Market

644
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,560
Was not

645
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,168
Actually illegal got away with it got away with it

646
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:49,568
Oh that makes me so happy

647
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:02,368
