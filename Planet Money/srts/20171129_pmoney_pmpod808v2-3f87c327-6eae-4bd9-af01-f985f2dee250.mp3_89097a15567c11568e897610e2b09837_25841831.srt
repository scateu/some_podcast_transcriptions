1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,816
When we decided to go see a rocket

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,424
I thought you know somehow we would get to stay and sort of close to it

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,008
You don't like on TV you see the rocket towering above you and all the

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,568
Flames and the smoke is billowing smoke everywhere

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,384
Of course the rocket people made a stand

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,664
Miles away

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,808
It makes sense they took his old converted school bus down a little dirt road

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,624
Anything let us out in the middle

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
Of nowhere

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:31,488
It's a field of scrub brush the Pacific Ocean is off in the distance

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,072
The only side of civilization is a couple of blue porta potties

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
Just in case

13
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,936
But somewhere just over the ridge is one of Humanity's greatest

14
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,960
Achievement

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
A rock

16
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
It is called the Minotaur C

17
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,800
It is 100

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Feet tall

19
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,896
And it is the rocket we've been waiting to see for the last

20
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
8 months

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,224
Worth $40

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,784
Carrying a bunch of very sophisticated satellite

23
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,600
But everyone stands around and acts like oh this is no

24
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,184
One of the executives from the rocket company John steinmeier

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,464
You make it sound

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,232
Routine

27
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:08,864
It's been a long period of time where we worked with the customer denigrate

28
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:15,520
Their satellites on to our launch vehicle make sure everything's compatible and everything will work well once they're deployed

29
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
You use all these words like vehicle but that's like a rocket

30
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,456
If rocket is more exciting we can call them Rockets

31
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,064
What is the space business boring

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Is good that's what they're doing

33
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
Happy

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,000
And there is no embarrassing video footage of a rocket exploding overhead

35
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,840
The only drama out here comes over a set of walkie talkies

36
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:45,984
That is the only way we know what's going on

37
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,824
Nominal is this our favorite word

38
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
Everything is okay

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
Nominal

40
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,968
I think the most sort of

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,040
Call if there's a word that is calmer than nominal I've never heard it

42
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,112
So someone says it is non nominal

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Probably off nominal

44
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,720
Domino's

45
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,816
Previous run not nominal

46
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
We were excited we were

47
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
Taking selfies with snake in the bottle

48
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,752
Champagne might be nominal for everybody else

49
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,592
This might be the single biggest moment in Planet Money history

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
Because just over that Horizon

51
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
On top

52
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,968
Of the Minotaur C rocket

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,992
Is

54
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
The planet

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
Money satellite

56
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,648
It is a little hunk of technology that we have adopt

57
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
We have been following for month

58
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
We've even etched the waveform

59
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,792
Of our voices are

60
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
Voices on the side of the satellite

61
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
If this actually works

62
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
Play nobody's going to space

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
1 minutes 1 minute

64
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
I really don't like I'm most

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Afraid

66
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,592
I'm most afraid that it's just going to be boring

67
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
Silently

68
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,912
Hello and welcome to Planet Money Robert Smith

69
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,496
Window podcast has gone

70
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Before

71
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Specs

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,640
This crazy stunt a Planet Money satellite would never

73
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Impossible

74
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,016
Space was so expensive that only governments and corporations could afford to launch a saddle

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,600
But everything is changing in the space business right now

76
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,464
Private rocket companies are driving down the price of launches satellites have shrunk

77
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
So much

78
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
You can hold them in the palm of your hand

79
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
He's becoming so easy

80
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
Even we can do it

81
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,144
So over the next few episodes of Planet Money

82
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,752
We're going to try to make sense of this new industry by going to space ourselves

83
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,336
Getting a satellite took this from rural Kentucky to Silicon Valley

84
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,736
To New Zealand and there are so many things that can go wrong, can you really build a working satellite on the cheap

85
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,576
Even if you do what can a satellite do in space

86
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
And you need to come up with a mission

87
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
What is after all this work

88
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
The rocket

89
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
The rocket just

90
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
Disappeared off the radar

91
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,399
We have negative telemetry

92
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,543
That means it's lost contact with it I think

93
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,551
Support for this podcast

94
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
In the following message

95
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
Did you come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

96
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
Developing solutions to support strong families and communities

97
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,791
To help ensure a brighter future for America's children

98
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,375
More information is available at aecf. Org

99
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
Okay we have to be honest with you

100
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,263
The Planet Money satellite started out as a joke around the office

101
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
About eight months ago we were brainstorming new project

102
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
You may remember that planet money already made it

103
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
T-shirt

104
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Fold around the globe

105
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,759
We did a project where we drilled for oil and turned it into

106
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
Oh you know what's next

107
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Space

108
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,671
Arthur Bryant had just seen something about a SpaceX

109
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Launch on the

110
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
The little news TV that that are elevate

111
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,839
I will laughed and I immediately started to sketch a mission patch

112
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
You know every space mission has a

113
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,215
The patch forts jumpsuits

114
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,543
You know we could put a squirrel on it and our names of mission patch

115
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,615
Emeril excited talking about it but it seems

116
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
Really impossible I mean first of all we

117
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
You obviously weren't going to

118
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
It no

119
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,039
Even a satellite receiver

120
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Really out of Arlo

121
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,439
They're only a couple thousand active satellites in orbit and they're almost exclusively owned by like

122
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
Spy agencies

123
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
Governments and multibillion-dollar

124
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
Imagine what it takes two

125
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
Build one of these sound like

126
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
I know it's before but they are huge

127
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
What kind of satellites that provide

128
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
GPS for phones or cable

129
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
No TV or predict the weather

130
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
Can be as big as a school bus

131
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
It's so complicated so expensive they can cost

132
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Half billion dollars

133
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:16,575
But one of our producers Elizabeth coolest was really captivated by this and she decided to look in

134
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Super

135
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
And she said

136
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,487
Toilet Lizbeth coming here what did they tell you

137
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
They said

138
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
It is actually the perfect time

139
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
To go to space

140
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
We are in the middle of

141
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Satellite Revolution

142
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
The satellites are getting smaller

143
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
And cheaper and it's easy to get to

144
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Too Faced

145
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
It's like the early days

146
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,335
Official computers when internet was invented

147
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
It is

148
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Wild out

149
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
Here right now and

150
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
We can get it on

151
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
I still wasn't completely

152
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Sure that it was

153
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
Possible but you know I thought fun

154
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
Fight will get a guide

155
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
Maybe someone who can show us

156
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
A possible way

157
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Into this

158
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,255
Anyone Kentucky but one person in particular

159
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
Apparently that the Steve Jobs

160
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
What's of the satellite Revolution

161
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
Use the guy who showed the world

162
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
Anyone could go to space

163
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
He works in Kentucky his name is Bob Quick's when we first spot Professor Twigs he is surrounded by

164
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Bike third grade

165
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Few kids run around

166
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:20,575
It is field trip day at the Space Science Center at Morehead State University interview then

167
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
Future graduate students

168
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
Spartacus wife here and

169
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Waves his hands around me

170
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Excitement

171
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,511
Maybe for kids but he reminds me of one of those at Owl character

172
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
As an early Pioneer in satellites

173
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
He could be running a billion-dollar

174
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:39,519
But he decided to stay in Academia and instead what he does is get students

175
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Excited about

176
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,895
It's kind of like jump starting a car you know I think I'm like that

177
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,503
The guy with the battery pack on my back and I go around to the students and I jump start

178
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,295
The students and once they get running

179
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,391
Then I can stand out on the road and they they learn more on their own than I can teach

180
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
And that is how Bob changed

181
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
The satellite industry

182
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,839
In the late 1990s he was teaching graduate engineering students at Stanford

183
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,423
Any figured they would be way more excited about designing satellites

184
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
If they actually got

185
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
To build one in

186
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Class

187
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
Something is big

188
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
Complicated the satellite

189
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
This is a tough assignment

190
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,943
The bigger it is some more things that they want to put in it and they just keep

191
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,343
Designing old we can add this and we can add that but was working with another researcher from University of down the road Cal Poly

192
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
It was Jordy push soiree

193
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,439
And what if they give the students

194
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
A constraint

195
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,487
A tiny box

196
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
They had to fit all of the electronics in

197
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Soda Factory

198
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
So it goes tattoo store in Mountain View California

199
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
One of the places

200
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
Like it Container Store

201
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,263
You know they sell all kinds of boxes you know that you're going to put the

202
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,151
Your favorite baseball in or your favorite basketball up and down the aisle

203
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
Saying too big too big too small too small and then you saw I saw

204
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
French boxer

205
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
The time you know there was the Beanie Baby craze

206
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
So that was the box that they put the beanie babies and you know you bought get a beanie baby and display it on the shelves or

207
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,375
The satellite started from a beanie baby box

208
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,447
Luckily Bob did not call his invention apt

209
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
Never name your technology after a

210
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
Instead he called it the cube satellite

211
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
Cubesat

212
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,479
And the original cubesat is inside the trophy case at Morehead State University

213
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Bob's boss Ben malphrus

214
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Drags us over

215
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,111
The city is so proud of this Dusty

216
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
The plastic Cube

217
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:37,535
And this is a great opportunity because the original model I predict one day will be in the Smithsonian

218
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
It says

219
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
Anything you want your satellite to do

220
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Has to fit in

221
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
You can't add more parts make a satellite bigger

222
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
You students

223
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
How to think smaller

224
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,663
The general Aerospace industry said that's the dumbest idea we've ever seen those academic geyser

225
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,247
We're out of their mind because it's so small it's not useful for any

226
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,831
Remember the Aerospace industry was sending up satellites

227
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Besides

228
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,487
Of a box and here's this researcher holding up something a little larger than a Rubik's Cube and saying

229
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
This is satellite to

230
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
It didn't make any sense

231
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
This was not an evolution to a slightly smaller product

232
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
This was a rebel

233
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
Everything about what was inside of a satellite

234
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
Add to beer

235
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,847
And this way to State an academic exercise for the fines to

236
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Stanford

237
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,943
Except there was this other Revolution going on at the same time

238
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
This was the early 2000

239
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
And very early smartphones

240
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
We're just being invented

241
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
And all those tiny phone transmitters

242
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
And processors

243
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Cameras

244
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
Just happened to fit into a beanie baby box

245
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
All the sudden satellites

246
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:46,911
We're so small that students could take risks they could try new things they could design a tiny satellite to take

247
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
The Arctic

248
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Or measure magnetic

249
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Weaves

250
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Earthquakes

251
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
And when you take risks with a new technology that's

252
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
When business Innovation happen

253
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
The personal computer Revolution didn't start when

254
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
Computers were the size of an entire room

255
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
It started with computers were small enough

256
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Play around

257
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
Take risks with in a garage

258
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
That's how Apple started

259
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Plymouth Satellite

260
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
Private companies looked at this and they said

261
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,511
I can think of a million things to do with a

262
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,119
Cubesat remembers visiting a company recently in San Francisco called planet

263
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
They make satellites that

264
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,239
The Earth and they have almost in assembly line process now

265
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
For making cubes

266
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
It's funded

267
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
Go in there and see you

268
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Shelf

269
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:33,247
50 satellite setting on it never thought I'd see that how long would that it taking you back in the day

270
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Oh

271
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,599
My the right we were building at almost 50 years

272
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
It's pretty easy

273
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:44,511
If you like even a podcast could build their own Cube satellite they do make kits for this

274
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,631
I need to probably make something that you know goes beep beep beep in space for under $10,000

275
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
Beeping in space that's cool right

276
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
That's better than beeping on the go

277
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,823
I thought we have a satellite that

278
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
Do something cool like

279
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
Pictures of Norco

280
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Realtor

281
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,431
Cargo ships

282
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Monitor global warming

283
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,295
Yeah for that level of satellite we're going to have to make some difficult

284
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
We're going to need to go shopping

285
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
For our very own

286
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
Cubesat

287
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
There is apparently a Walmart

288
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
Of satellites

289
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
It is the small satellite conference

290
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
In Logan Utah

291
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,887
Like small satellite conference or small satellite

292
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,703
Conference the satellites are small

293
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
The conference

294
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
Is map

295
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,847
Oh my God it's a robot it's a robot

296
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
I think it's a robot

297
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,711
Once Upon a Time the small satellite conference

298
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Was for a cat

299
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,295
Scientists were building Hardware

300
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
Data analyst

301
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
And they are still here going to want students to

302
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,463
But these days you can smell the money in the air

303
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,279
The big rocket companies are here SpaceX

304
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
Blue origin rocket lab

305
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,911
It'll be 20 ft you can stop by a booth of some startup satellite

306
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
Giving away a little

307
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
Light up keychain

308
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Foam Rockets

309
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,311
Is Bob's tiny cubesats are everywhere

310
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,847
It is an industry standard now

311
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:08,735
You can get a single box it is called A1 you as in 1 Beanie Baby unit

312
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:15,135
So just as basic as the basic basically I'm holding my hand it's like a frame with some Electronics in it

313
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
Is $10,000

314
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,743
Of course then you have to fill up

315
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
Cubesat their boots that will sell you

316
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
Cameras radiation monitors

317
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,655
Mike Creech at the booth for millennium Space Systems

318
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
Chesapeake inexpensive

319
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,007
Do you have to have power you need some sort of computer

320
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:36,127
You need a way to navigate know where you are in the space in the sky

321
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,735
And those things just take time to develop every single mission is unique

322
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,807
In that case you might want to upgrade to a 3

323
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
You satellite

324
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
As in

325
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
3 Beanie Baby

326
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,951
Yeah in the booth for the company Blue Canyon

327
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
Cool shiny floor models

328
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
So I asked your head if we wanted your

329
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
Basic model

330
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,911
Like you're just your cheapest strip down

331
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
Box with some Electronics

332
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,263
What range of cost are we talking to

333
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Equipment is

334
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,127
Play the highest and that you're going to find in this category

335
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Peerless Steel

336
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
Fraction the price of a traditional space

337
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
Dorothy want to drop the sticker price on me what's going to be

338
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,647
A million

339
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Under million

340
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
Mapreduce Elizabeth

341
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,303
Laughing out loud at that price tag

342
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,119
I mean compared to the half-billion-dollar community

343
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,423
Location satellite pizarra Barton

344
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
But we were thinking maybe more in the lake

345
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
Thousands or

346
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919
Hundreds of dollars range like I was crazy

347
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Where

348
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
Satellite

349
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
It's always on eBay

350
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
Could always play the nonprofit

351
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
But card you know the sort of charity

352
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
Impulse

353
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,487
So the conference about who might

354
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
Linda Sadler

355
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,375
You know for journalistic purposes allow us to adopt one for short mission

356
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
We called everybody who makes

357
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,495
Satellite saying Hey Joe mixer satellite can we

358
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,567
Jump on board with your satellite we bagged tea bags

359
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
We need to put our name on a saddle

360
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,431
Maybe do something cool with it

361
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
And what company said

362
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
Let's talk about

363
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
Why don't you drop by our office

364
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
Certain San Francisco

365
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
And we can discuss

366
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,439
It was in fact the company the bobbed wigs

367
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
Had mentioned that he visit in San Francisco the company with

368
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,327
The strangely similar name to ours

369
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Planet

370
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
Felt like this was a good sign

371
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,215
It's open

372
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,847
Planet San Francisco office is right down the street from the headquarters of

373
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
Twitter and Uber

374
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
And they're going for the same Tech startup vibe

375
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,015
Although because it is space Hardware

376
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,831
I have to sign a promise not to steal any military Secret

377
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,975
Confidential information show me any technical non-tech like my Apple terms of service contract

378
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,535
Did not read the fine print signed it anyway

379
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
And now I can legally in

380
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Enjoy my time

381
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,679
It starts at Mission Control with the launch director

382
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
Which sounds way more serious than it is

383
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,055
Exception is 29 years old

384
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Pretty laid-back guy

385
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,175
Admission control looks like the back of a Best Buy a budget

386
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
TVs on the wall and

387
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
Hardware piled on the desks

388
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,111
We have satellites lying around everywhere

389
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,975
Four five of them in a cabinet here yes and that's just for starters so

390
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,535
There's another cabinet full of satellites are there

391
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
Now you're just showing off

392
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,887
The reason we have so many is the planets

393
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
Business model

394
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
Changing the way we

395
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,007
We've all seen those satellite photos on

396
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:48,639
Google Maps satellite

397
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
Beastly only get a good shot of your house

398
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
What planet thought

399
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
All these little cubesat

400
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
Why wait for one big

401
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
Satellite to tremble by

402
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
Why not launch hundreds

403
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Small one

404
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,023
Delta faster launch them faster take more risks

405
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
The Cuban way

406
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,887
Mike shows me a TV and back with an image of the

407
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
And you can see all these little.

408
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
Bt200 up

409
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Each one

410
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Is a satellite

411
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,543
Planet has an orbit

412
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
Over Hawaii

413
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
Alaska

414
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:26,271
Over the North Pole of a big string of satellites going down over the United Kingdom looks

415
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
Play through

416
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:32,159
France Spain Hospital satellite up in space

417
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
300 miles

418
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
Anywhere around the globe

419
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
The North Pole

420
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
To the South Pole

421
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,887
The back to the North Pole again every 90 minutes

422
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
Pickle pictures the whole Way North

423
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
South North Pole South Pole

424
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
If you could float in space and see it

425
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
It would look like

426
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,639
What would appear to be like a String of Pearls

427
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,223
Going over roughly the North Pole from North to South

428
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,807
And as the String of Pearls is rotating in its orbit

429
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
The Earth is rotating underneath

430
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
And so that

431
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,183
That line of satellites axes a line scanner

432
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:10,303
And so they're slowly sweeping across the Earth's surface every 24 hours

433
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
And that enables us to get it

434
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,887
An image of every place

435
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,703
A picture of almost every place on Earth

436
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Every 24 hours

437
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,567
The way it works is it no matter where you are in Earth around

438
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,615
10 in the morning just getting coffee

439
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
There is almost certainly a

440
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
Planet satellite

441
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,759
Whizzing by over your head and taking a picture it is

442
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,527
Mine

443
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
And you know what put for started to launch a satellite to

444
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
A few years ago

445
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
They would name each one and heavy

446
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Speak ceremonies

447
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
Now they have so many

448
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
It is totally

449
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Working

450
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Show routine

451
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
Would a company like this even notice

452
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,423
If Public Radio podcast just you know

453
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
Borrowed a satellite

454
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
For a little while

455
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
Maybe we could push a couple

456
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Tote bags

457
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,615
We have one

458
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
I mean

459
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,687
You know just to borrow it

460
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,503
No money Changing Hands no contract

461
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
Just a sort of

462
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
Temporary adoption

463
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
And some calls for me to Camanche

464
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
The chain and they said

465
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,487
How about satellite 0f 1C

466
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
I went down to the lab

467
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
To see it

468
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,863
Okay so welcome to the factory

469
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
We need to put on coat

470
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
But we can help you with that

471
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,031
If I meet someone who's recognizable from all of the space exploration movies

472
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
The guy who builds

473
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
The satellites

474
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
He's wearing a bow tie

475
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
Dental lab coat

476
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
His name is Chester Gilmore

477
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
And this is Planet Money satellite

478
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
This is your adopted spacecraft

479
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
So they tell me

480
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
I don't know what to say that means he's gorgeous

481
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
Look at shiny

482
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,743
Oh okay so how how do you normally describe the size of it

483
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
About the size of a loaf of bread

484
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:52,191
Or you know media a shoebox for like ballet slipper very very nice elegant and crap

485
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
Capable ballets

486
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,847
Just two dudes talking about ballet slippers

487
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
I'm technically this is a 3

488
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,943
You that's three Beanie Baby box

489
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,783
It is the direct descendant of Bob wigs trip to a container store

490
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,319
Can I pick it up

491
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
Yes

492
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Yes

493
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
Pause to remember

494
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,047
Well yeah because this is actually going to go into space

495
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,375
So anywhere else they would probably tell you absolutely not you can never pick up

496
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,679
Satellite but yes you can pick up the satellite

497
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,215
I'll ask you to pick it up like this

498
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,799
I was just allowed to touch the edges and when I pick it up it is

499
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,591
Super deaf you don't like

500
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Picking up a baby

501
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Okay

502
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,199
And if you break it you buy it

503
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,759
Joking exercise kinda

504
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,551
These things are pretty tough

505
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,367
You told me the story about one time when they were launching

506
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
A rocket

507
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
With these little cubesats in it and the rocket

508
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Blew up

509
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
It blew up after launch

510
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,559
And satellites just like this would rain down all over the

511
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,351
Let me turn them on and they all work

512
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,703
Chester opens up the metal casing and shows me inside as lots of

513
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,263
Gold Parts but basically it's a big

514
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,103
Camera like one of those cameras with the giant lens you see on the sidelines

515
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Sporting events

516
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
A normal lens is the electronic

517
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,735
A little antenna to send the photos back to Earth

518
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
Little gizmos that allow you to

519
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
Herne the satellites

520
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Spirit a bit

521
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,903
Just as you can put together the whole thing in about 4 hours

522
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,744
Amazing can go from assembly to testing to space in a matter of

523
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,048
And that's the cutest whole new space

524
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
The idea is to move fast

525
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Innovate

526
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
Quickly satellites like

527
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Lick iPhone

528
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,008
Write a release a bunch into space

529
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:34,592
And then you two months later they come up with redesigns and updates

530
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,152
They launched some more and then some more and it's amore

531
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
The telescope quick

532
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
And then after a few years

533
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
After a few years back

534
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:48,672
Chester says one day you'll be looking at a photo from a satellite and you'll notice that the images of the Earth are getting closer

535
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,952
And closer

536
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
I'm closer

537
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,536
So the first thing that happens is our imagery gets better

538
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
Because we're closer

539
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
If a good-news-bad-news situation

540
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
Yeah it's like

541
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,984
You're talking to the whole time it's going you can talk to you the whole time it's going down

542
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,568
And the Earth gets closer and closer the images get better and better and then

543
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,736
But we all make the noise quiet quiet

544
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,784
Raise a glass

545
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:20,160
The death of satellite is treated as a kind of Celebration because it allows planet to replace that satellite

546
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
With a better

547
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
With more features

548
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:25,024
Even if we managed to get little zero f1c

549
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
The Planet Money satellite into space

550
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
It is not going to have long till

551
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
So we have to make the most

552
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
David short beautiful life

553
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
Manchester let me in on a little secret

554
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
Making a satellite

555
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Pretty straightforward

556
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,944
Figuring out how to get it into space and what to do with it once it's there

557
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
That part

558
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
It's more complicated

559
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808

People often think of nobodies are too conservative

570
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,568
Too complex or only for retirees

571
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336

642
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
Money to burn

643
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656

00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,856
They can lose steam quickly

652
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,416
So I'm thinking we should go with something simple

653
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,696
A classic

654
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
