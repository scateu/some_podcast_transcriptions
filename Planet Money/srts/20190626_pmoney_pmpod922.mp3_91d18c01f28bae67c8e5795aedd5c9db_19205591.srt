Alexei a couple of months ago I did something I'm not

13
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016

Is here to listen to your problems

17
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,952
So recently I moved into a new place

18
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,328
How to pay my landlord security deposit $1,500 and he tells me to pay him with venmo

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,424
Which is great I use venmo all the time at least they did until this happened

20
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
That's for about a

21
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,264
But also very happy on the part of your landlord

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,640
Anyone who doesn't venmo is this super easy app on your phone lets you pay your friends or

23
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,664
Total strangers

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,456
Pause money from your bank account

25
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,064
You can even add little pithy comments or or silly emojis to your transactions

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,112
So I go to venmo my landlord

27
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,928
Have his user ID which is basically his name

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,560
His first name is Steven I'm going to leave off his last name so no one blows up his venmo account

29
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,656
And because there are a bunch of people with his name there

30
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Steven 1 Steven 2

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,728
Steven says

32
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,008
Steven number one

33
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
Nicf

34
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
Steven one

35
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,664
So I choose that user I type in the amount $1,500 no extra zeros

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
Hit pay

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
Easy peasy

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
Except

39
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,832
30 minutes later I get a message from Steven one saying

40
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
Pretty sure you have the wrong person

41
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,416
And I'm like

42
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
What I

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,512
I specifically check this

44
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,608
But I go back I look and I see that I've actually made a mistake

45
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912
Instead of typing Stephen with a v

46
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,752
I've written it with a pH I just sent $1,500 to

47
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Forest ranger

48
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
And I'm like

49
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,592
Okay

50
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Give it back

51
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
And he says

52
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
No

53
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,296
Steven with a pH help me look if it's really a mistake then just get venmo.

54
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,344
And so I call venmo

55
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,136
Explain to them what happened

56
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
Steak typo

57
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Can you just cancel this

58
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
And this mental person says

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
No

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
They can just cancel it

61
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
And now I'm starting to seriously

62
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
Play freak out

63
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,272
$1,500 my first thought was

66
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
Crap

67
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
Second thought

68
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,416
Is there a light-hearted economic narrative podcast in this instinct

69
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,000
Today on the show when should you be able to get your money back

70
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
This is a surprisingly complicated question an envelope of cash is different from a credit card is

71
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,984
Different from venmo and The Wizard different can be a big deal

72
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,104
Especially when you sent the wrong Stephen $1,500

But one TV show made it mainstream

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
Now

94
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
We break down drags current Renaissance

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
Check out NPR's it's been in

96
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Now

97
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,776
So the core question in the show today

98
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:01,152
Is when should you be able to get your money back and buy you I mean me I mean my money

99
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,040
The whole idea that we could even instantly get our money back is actually an invention and not even a very old one

100
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,880
Back in the 1960s when credit cards were first starting to take off

101
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
People with credit cards did not have the power to undo

102
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,976
And it was

103
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,280
That would be charged the wrong amount

104
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
They would be double charged

105

Is a staff attorney at the National Consumer law

106
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,871
Center or someone would take their car and and use it without their consent and they would try to

107
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
Battle with the credit card companies to get them to

108
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
To fix the error

109
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,319
And the problem was the credit card companies would just ignore them

110
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
And in fact

111
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
Which St

112
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415
Keep demanding payment

113
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,487
Without addressing the consumer's complaint

114
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,559
So eventually Congress kicks into action and he starts

115
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
Passing laws

116
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,887
In 1974 they pass

117
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
What is the most

118
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,471
Powerful consumer protections we have ever had

119
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,799
This is an undo button like no other it's something called

120
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
A chargeback

121
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
A chargeback is when you

122
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
Challenge something on your credit card and it gets

123
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
Reversed its charge

124
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Back to the merch

125
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,391
You can do that if your credit card got stolen and you didn't authorize the charge but also if a store charged you the wrong amount

126
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
Now you just go to your bank

127
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Dispute the charge

128
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
And if you are wrongly build they undo it

129
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
If I'm them to make sure that happen

130
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,887
Not only does that mean I can now get my money back with one call

131
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,703
It also means everybody feels more comfortable using credit

132
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
And uses that more and more

133
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Which is good for the credit card

134
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
So

135
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,127
Why doesn't venmo do this for me when I call them

136
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
Like why don't they just undo the transaction

137
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
Other people have been asking this to

138
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,599
Last year there was a story on page one of the Wall Street Journal with the headline

139
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,695
So you accidentally sent $149 to a stranger on venmo

140
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
Good luck getting it back

141
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,303
One possible reason venmo doesn't let us get our money back

142
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
Because when you let us demand our money back

143
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
We go wild

144
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,215
You know this because of what happened with credit card charge

145
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,591
We started demanding our money when any reasonable person would say we shouldn't get it

146
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
It's a chargeback

147
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,967
Canal there people whose entire job is dealing with these chargebacks

148
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
La Quinta Cove

149
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,575
There was somebody who had taken the series of golf lessons

150
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
And then at the end

151
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
I disputed

152
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
That there

153
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,767
Score hasn't improved a sufficient amount and they were dissatisfied

154
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
Solution chargeback

Katie works for square which is a company that process

156
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
This is credit card payments

157
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
So when you swipe your card or sticker chip in a machine

158
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,543
That machine comes from a credit card processor like

159
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
Square they're basically middlemen

160
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
Square mostly works with small business

161
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
At one of those businesses thinks a chargeback isn't fair

162
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
Square help them fight back to keep the money

163
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:51,135
In order to do that they have to convince the bank associated with the customer's credit card

164
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,695
Katy cobras team spent all day

165
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,023
Every weekday answering calls consoling merchants

166
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
And helping them gather the evidence they need to win the case

167
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,167

Flash Detective

171
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
Can you sing some truly ridiculous charge

172
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,199
Like the client who received their payment for an allegedly subpar window cleaning

173
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:20,319
3 months and several rainstorms after the cleaning and question again

174
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
And of course there was the

175
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Case of

176
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
The floral wedding

177
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
The cake was about $800

178
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,279
When date Katie got a call from an upset client

179
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
A bigger

180
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,631
She had delivered the cake and it had been consumed

181
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:39,007
And she had her no no complaints for them as far as she knew they had been totally satisfied

182
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
And

183
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
A few weeks later

184
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,871
She received this payment dispute notification

185
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,431
Thought the couple wanted their money

186
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,527
I did they say what they were disputing or does that sort of detail come through

187
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,087
There were flowers on the cake and there was some.

188
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
Discrepancy on the color of the flower

189
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
The claim was that they were a little too bright

190
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
So

191
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Katie got to work

192
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:06,143
Calming her client down walking her through all the possible pieces of evidence that could help prove to the bank

193
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
Did the Baker at held up

194
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Printable

195
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,543
She had a chain of email correspondence where they had agreed on

196
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
All the details about the cake

197
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
And

198
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
In addition to that

199
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,039
She had post from social media where she had taken screenshots and it was the couple

200
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
With their gas

201
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
Celebrating and eating the cake

202
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
And there were

203
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:33,535
Comments on social media from their gas saying how much they enjoyed it and from the couple saying that they were thrilled

204
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
Wasn't that a wonderful cake

205
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,143
What did you think when you first saw the social media post

206
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
I thought we had it nailed

207
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
It was just

208
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,287
So blatant I couldn't imagine that they would be able

209
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,079
To get away with getting their money back

210
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:52,479
I like smiling with pieces of cake in their teeth and stuff each other

211
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
What's it mean having a wonderful time

212
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:59,391
Soba stashes infuriating I'm actually getting worked up a little bit

213
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,951
With Katie's help the baker got to keep the money

214
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
The bank decided in

215
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Her favor

216
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,047
Kitty also told us this one other story

217
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,607
About a small family-owned Construction Company

218
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,423
It doesn't really expensive remodel of a home

219
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
And then the customer chargeback

220
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
Tens of thousands of dollars

221
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
The business lost the case and had to shut down

222
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
And even when business is due when

223
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
There's a cost

224
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,759
Katie salary comes out of the fees businesses pay to use Square as their credit card price

225
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
And this isn't just a square foot

226
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,391
Every business pays fees to accept credit cards

227
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,951
It often there extra fees for chargebacks

228
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,279
Business is past all those fees on to us in the prices

229
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,375
So there is a cost to the power to undo

230
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
That we are all pay

231
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
After the break

232
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,847
I try to get back that $1,500 I venmoed Steven

233
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
PhD pen

234
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
With a pH

So back to my venmo story

248
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,791
To recap

249
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,631
I accidentally sent $1,500 to Stephen with a pH

250
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
Because of a typo

251
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Steven headset

252
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,263
Call venmo which I did I ask him to cancel it

253
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
And now it's been a credit card payment

254
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,639
That would have been at your I call venmo

255
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Get a chargeback

256
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
It would have been done

257
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,991
But venmo is not a credit card

258
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
He told me that's not how to

259
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
No chargeback no chargeback

260
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,671
Venmo tells me they can't cancel a payment without Stevens permission

261
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
So they say they'll email him

262
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
He says he doesn't get the email

263
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,279
I called him again

264
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,351
The email again and again he says he didn't get it

265
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,167
And I start crying on the phone to venmo little bit

266
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
But when I was done freaking out

267
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:27,615
You know I asked venmo one more time this time as a reporter not as a disgruntled or weepy customer

268
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
I have some okay

269
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,943
Why do you do it this way

270
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,039
Why don't you give people an undo button you know that equivalent of a chargeback

271
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
Didn't want to talk on tape for the story

272
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
But they did say in an email that quote making funds instantly available to recipients is part of why customers love

273
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Using PayPal and venmo

274
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
And quote

275
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
By the way venmo is owned by PayPal

276
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
And they also said they're in line with what other apps are

277
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,519
And that is reasonable enough and undo option would

278
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
How to suck anyway

279
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
Imagine cash work light

280
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,895
You know you go out to a fancy meal with your friend

281
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,479
You pay the check your friend gives you 20 bucks for their end of the deal

282
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,551
And then when you get home you open your wallet all of a sudden

283
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Proof

284
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
The $20 is gone

285
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
That would suck

286
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,951
Honey buns are great for the person hitting undo

287
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
Are there any pretty rotten for the person on the other side

288
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,839
I know actually also said that they do all kinds of things.

289
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,399
Stop people from making mistakes in the first place

290
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Like

291
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
They get people to post profile pictures

292
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,799
Or they'll find any payments to someone that you've never paid before

293
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
In my case none of that stuff would have asked

294
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
Help but

295
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
You know I could see how

296
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Somebody

297
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
I think there's actually more to this

298
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
And I think part of the reason they don't have an undo button

299
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,343
Has to do with the way that venmo's Corp business works

300
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,671
And how it's actually fundamentally different from the way that credit cards do

301
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,231
Every time you buy something with a credit card

302
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047
The business selling you that thing has to pay fees

303
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,887
And part of those fees pay for the Katy cobras of the world to deal with charges

304
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
Venmo on the other hand does not charge a fee when you send money to a friend

305
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,079
Or your landlord or a stranger you think is your landlord

306
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Thanks but also

307
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
No chargeback

308
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,455
Yeah so there's a trade-off here you know you pay a fee

309
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,039
Maybe you get an undo button you get that charge back or

310
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
You don't pay a fee and you're kind of stuck with

311
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
The payments you make

312
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
How does venmo make money

313
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
They don't

314
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,535
At least they don't when Ordinary People send money to each other using their Bank

315
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,703
Venmo does charge fees for some premium features like faster Bank transfers and using venmo to pay some vendors Direct

316
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,775
It also charges transaction fees to some Merchant

317
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
How to use venmo

318
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Bottom line

319
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,871
Venmo was not going to fix this for me

320
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
It was up to Steven to actually give me my money back

321
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,271
And the only way that I had to contact him was by actually messaging him

322
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Through the venmo app

323
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
So

324
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
I did

325
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:51,743
Actually messaged him 18 times on that first day shred on my phone

326
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,583
Alexi there's a back-and-forth I mentioned earlier where

327
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
Steven Latino

328
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
But I should go to venmo get them to

329
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
21

330
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,007
I get back to Steven and here's here's a distilled version of what happened

331
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
Venmo has just contacted you

332
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Steven

333
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
They have not

334
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Me

335
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
I would really like to resolve this

336
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
With dignity

337
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
And without escalation

338
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
This is legally my money

339
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
Steven

340
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
Look whoever you are I am not keeping your money you sent it to the wrong person and I did the right thing by letting you know

341
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
As long as bendo contacts me

342
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
I have no problem sending it back

343
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,679
So basically I am freaking out I mean you can tell from

344
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
Play writing I'm like

345
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,543
Insinuating I'm going to see him I'm having a meltdown

346
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
And finally Stephen says

347
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Look

348
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
Why don't you just call your bank and have them

349
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Cancel it

350
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,527
So I'm pretty sure this is the first moment I actually logged into my bank account

351
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,855
And that's when I saw the $1,500 was still there

352
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
I'd had my money

353
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
The whole time

354
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,535
There's this weird thing going on like inside the venmo universe

355
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
When you venmo money to a friend or whoever

356
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
It appears in your friends venmo account instant

357
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:06,751
But venmo doesn't actually take money out of your bank account instantly

358
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
That actually takes some time

359
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
It wasn't really like I just

360
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,431
Handed an envelope of cash to a stranger you know even though that's how it felt

361
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
So that night

362
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Call my bank and I tell them look

363
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Venmo is about

364
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,879
Take $1,500 out of my account I do not want to give them

365
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
That $1,500

366
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
Could you block that

367
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,791
I've never tried this before never put a stop on a bank payment

368
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
But it's really easy they don't

369
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
Ask too many questions they're just like

370
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,727
Yeah okay will do that cost you $30 then like

371
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Great

372
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,287
Do that please thank you

373
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
Then

374
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,455
3 days later I got an email from venmo saying I owe them $1,500

375
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,015
They're going to freeze my account until I'm settled up

376
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,063
But then an hour after that

377
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
I got a second email

378
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
Say actually

379
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,391
It's all good

380
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
I don't know the money money

381
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Account is unfrozen

382
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,303
Just like that three days after it started it was all over

383
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,143
But I still didn't totally understand what it happened

384
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,727
Mean one minute I owe venmo 1500 the next I don't

385
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
Which means either

386
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,335
Steven finally agreed to under the payment

387
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
Or maybe venmo I decided to

388
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,175
Fix this for me after all

389
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
I couldn't tell which one it was

390
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,039
My son Steven one more message

391
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Hey

392
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
Weird question

393
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,207
But would you possibly be interested in being interviewed for an NPR Planet Money segment

394
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
And he said yes

395
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
The forcefulness of you

396
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Bam

397
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Is a

398
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
A little intimidating

399
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:44,543
Steven with a pH lives in Birmingham Alabama and use a surprises I was by this whole thing

400
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
How's that work

401
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
You know I get a notification

402
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
And

403
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,015
I didn't know what it was I don't know if I hit accept

404
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
Whatever I did

405
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
You know that's just there

406
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
Oh I had no idea what was

407
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
You know what was going on

408
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:06,047
I don't know if you're like some drug lord or trying to steal my money and I don't like I don't know

409
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
I don't have your gun shot my leg off later to get

410
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,375
Cashback

411
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
I don't know

412
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,983
I thought I was being kind of polite actually

413
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,567
But I like that I'm sorry this kind of fear

414
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Moore Stephens com

415
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,687
The one thing I wanted to know from Steven was

416
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
How is it that one minute

417
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:29,855
I owed $1,500 the next minute I was all squared up with venmo had he done something

418
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
What

419
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,463
What happened at your a bear for so long

420
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
I figured they weren't going to do anything

421
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
Steven says he never got in touch with venmo

422
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
Never got any of their emails

423
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
But the $1,500

424
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
Did disappear from his venmo account at one point

425
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
To Spanish.

426
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,287
It's like the whole thing it never happened

427
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,615
And frankly what went down it's a little opaque to me

428
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,431
Ask them about it they wouldn't tell me

429
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
What's clear is that in the end

430
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
They're actually was the secret undo button

431
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
At my bank

432
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,367
And it cost me 30 bucks to use it

433
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
Lundy button is basically this trade-off

434
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
The credit cards we have an idea

435
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
An awesome safety-net for consumer

436
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
But we all pay for it

437
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
Whether we know it or not

438
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
With cash there's no fee

439
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
And No undo button

440
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,263
Venmo is this new grey area

441
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
It's not really cash

442
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Not really credit card

443
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,431
It's this new in between thing and we're using it all the time

444
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,735
And kind of still trying to figure out what it is

Oh yeah

465
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
It was my girl

466
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
She made it

467
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:46,559
She told me to keep it

468
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
Yes

469
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
