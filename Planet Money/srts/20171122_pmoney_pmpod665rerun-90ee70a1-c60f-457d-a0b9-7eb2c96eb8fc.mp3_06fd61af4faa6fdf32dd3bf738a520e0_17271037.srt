1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:03,072
About 10 years ago Suzana Morgan was running

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,096
Food bank in Alaska

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,400
And she really needed fresh Pro

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,936
Produce she always did

5
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,032
One day the phone rang it was a speak National charity called

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,056
Feeding America

7
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,384
Feeding America is this network of food banks all around the country

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,408
Including Suzanne

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
What they do is they get these

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,968
Big donations

11
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,016
Food and they figure out where they should go

12
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,320
I'm just called they said they had a big donation

13
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,112
It was not fresh produce

14
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,672
It was a truckload of 5 gallon buckets

15
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,000
You're kidding me you're offering me pickles

16
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,680
Make a person who said yeah I know I know I know but you guys have been hanging out there at the top of the list

17
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,704
For quite a while

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,544
This is the first thing we've had that we think will really make it all the way to Alaska

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,568
What are you doing

20
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,432
We strong-armed every soup kitchen we could find instead

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:55,040
Peking pickles to ask the people

22
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Feeding America

23
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
Why are we getting more fresh produce

24
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,624
And so

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,464
Feeding America would say well we didn't offer you that truckload of oranges

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,816
Out of California because we thought they'd Transportation be too expensive and I would say

27
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,936
That's green there that's because Susannah had set up her own transportation

28
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,776
So they're feeding America had offered her fresh fruits or vegetables

29
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
She could get them truck to Alaska really cheaply

30
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,152
But the people at the feeding America home office didn't know that

31
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,456
In a lot of food banks had this problem

32
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,504
One food bank director in Idaho

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
My home state

34
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,064
Complained that he got a truck load

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,440
I mean come on it's Idaho of course he already had a warehouse full of potatoes

36
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
But have been donated by local

37
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
Call Farmers

38
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,328
This is the real consequences for Hungry people all over the

39
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
It meant that

40
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:44,192
People in Alaska we're not getting fresh produce we're not getting saved

41
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,032
And at the same time the food bank in Idaho had too many

42
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
Not enough other stuff

43
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Everybody knew this was

44
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,896
But for a long time they just live

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,504
And then Susanna says a new CEO came into feeding America

46
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,088
And as usual what happens when you bring in a pair of fresh eyes they look at

47
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Get something and say

48
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,464
Can't imagine how you guys are living with that system that sucks

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,328
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob Goldstein

50
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,864
And I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
Do they have a show a bunch of food bank directors

52
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
Including at least one socialist

53
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Tried to figure out

54
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Better way

55
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
To get food

56
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
They're bold experiment

57
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Free market

58
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,664
Sort of freak

59
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
Definitely

60
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
By the way

61
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,296
The show originally ran back in 2015

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,160

Bold experiment having about

72
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
10 years ago

73
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,160
The new CEO started gathering together a group

74
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
Time from headquarters Food Bank directors from around the country including Suzana Morgan from Alaska also

75
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
From the University of Chicago

76
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,704
Susanna and the other food bank directors start flying to Chicago every

77
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Sitting down in a room

78
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
And talking about their own version

79
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Of the pickle prop

80
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
And pretty soon Susanna says

81
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
To get to the heart of it

82
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,480
It is a problem for someone else to make decisions for you

83
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
It is a problem with somebody else is trying to decide whether this is something you need or not when they don't know what's in your infant

84
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
At the moment

85
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
They don't know what your local donations

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
Suppliers they don't know what your

87
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,400
What donated Transportation you've arranged for or what your fundraising is at the moment

88
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,800
To have a central office trying to make those decisions far away from those sources

89
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
Pictures of knowledge led to all sorts of mismatches

90
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,200
When it comes in the room heard Susanna and her colleagues layout

91
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
The problem this way

92
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
They got very

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Excited

94
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
Suzanne remembers one Economist in

95
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
Hannah Sprint

96
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,768
Once we were able to lay it out in those clear terms and then Candice from the University of Chicago was able to

97
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Jose well

98
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
Sounds like an economic problem to me

99
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,007
Sounds like economics 101

100
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
There's the sprays in economics

101
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
The local knowledge problem

102
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,407
And it's why centrally planned economies don't work

103
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,991
No matter how smart the people in control are

104
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
Weather there in headquarters

105
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Capital One

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
The castle or whatever

107
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,231
They just don't have the knowledge to decide whether the people you know out in Alaska should get

108
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
Pickles are orange

109
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
When I talk to

110
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,351
Economist who was in the room with Suzanne in the others

111
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
He told me that

112
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
Clear answer to the local knowledge problem is

113
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
A market

114
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
Place where buyers and sellers

115
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
Because the beauty of a mark

116
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
Reticular the beauty of prices

117
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,919
If they show you how much different people are

118
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
In this case different Food Bag

119
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
Value different things

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
McKenna says that room full of food bankers

121
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,367
Was not very excited to hear his

122
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
Pitch for the virtues of the

123
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
The free market

124
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
One of the

125
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,047
To Bankers a wonderful guy called John Arnold came up to me and said look

126
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
I'm sorry

127
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,887
I have no interest in this I listen to you but I don't think of any entry

128
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
I should mention that John Arnold passed away a couple years ago but when I ran this quote by Susanna she said yeah I could totally am a

129
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
Johnson

130
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,663
And anyway John was not the only food that girl who is wearing

131
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
The market

132
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
I think many of them have

133
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
The following sentence

134
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
Markets are sometimes unfair

135
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
It benefits

136
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
The powerful

137
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
It benefits the wealthy benefits

138
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Strong

139
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
There

140
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
Focus is so much

141
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
And the others

142
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
The ones who've been left

143
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,303
Behind left behind by Mark

144
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
By tomorrow night market

145
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Flea markets

146
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
And their great fear is that

147
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,959
Whatever we came up with would do the same

148
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
And if it did

149
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
They would prefer they also

150
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
The idea of a market just seems

151
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:11,199
Fundamentally contrary to the spirit of food activities are places that give away food

152
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
For free too hungry

153
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,831
And in any case it wasn't like feeding America could just sell food to the local

154
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,743
One problem with that is the food banks in poor areas often have the hardest time raising money from local donors

155
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
So they wouldn't have enough money

156
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
I need to buy the

157
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
So Kanis and the other economist

158
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Ask the food

159
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
What about fake money

160
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
What is feeding America

161
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Did its own little economy

162
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,359
And give out fake money to all the food banks which they could use

163
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
To buy the food

164
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
Next question they said was

165
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Butthead

166
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,991
How do we make sure the neediest

167
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Lowes Foods

168
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Switch reset

169
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
We getting the most fake money

170
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,135
And sometimes late maybe that was one of the early

171
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,975
Breakthrough moments which was the idea that the poor can actually be wealthier than the rich

172
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
In fake money

173
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
In fake money

174
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Exactly

175
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
You can imagine

176
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Escaping this fake money

177
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
Need to the neediest place

178
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,983
Isis and then letting them buy you know whatever they want out of this National feeding America

179
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,055
But you still have to solve all these other problems

180
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
What should prices be in this new fake love

181
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
How do you let everybody shop in a way that's fair

182
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
Tok more flights to Chicago

183
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Forbidden City

184
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
The Economist

185
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
And finally

186
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
Kenneth and his colleagues came up with the big idea

187
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
Suzana Morgan remembers when

188
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
China said

189
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Well

190
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
How about eBay

191
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,535
How would it work if we set up a system in which all of the food

192
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,351
In truckloads that's donated goes onto a

193
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
A technology platform

194
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,263
And the decision as to whether you want it for your food bank is made at the food bank

195
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
And

196
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,871
How much you wanted is made by how much you bid on it

197
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
And how did that play in the room

198
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:51,039
The clouds opened and the angels sang

199
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:56,671
That never happened

200
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
Okay maybe wasn't quite.

201
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
That biblical but

202
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
Literally this

203
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,607
This moment in which we just went

204
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
We have had a breakthrough

205
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,215
And then we had to spend a year 18 months after that working out the

206
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
The details

207
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
But it was details from that point

208
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
It was like setting up a whole lot

209
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Fake money

210
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Prices at by auction

211
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
And with that

212
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
Kiki twist

213
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
The food banks the fed the most hungry

214
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
People would get the most

215
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Fake money

216
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,719
To see how the system works in real life I went out to the Community Food Bank of New Jersey

217
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
Teva shoes Warehouse out by the Newark Airport

218
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
Tristan wallet give me

219
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,887
Can see some raisins up here

220
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,959
Can salmon you got some grapefruit juice

221
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:47,359
What else do we have here we have some tomato sauce

222
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
I think money is samsara

223
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:54,783
The pancakes are interested in particular cuz I know we just bought some pancake mix

224
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,599
So the moment when syrup was particularly valuable

225
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,927
Cuz you are a guy with pancake batter but no syrup exactly

226
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,023
Soap at least for now that means a lot of people in New Jersey can now have syrup

227
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
With their pancakes

228
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,863
Full cut up here we can head back to the office

229
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
The office is a smallest room attached to the warehouse

230
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
It's weird Tristan bids annies auction

231
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
We get in there and he open the browser on disk

232
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
Computer plugs into the feeding America

233
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
System and shows me this morning's auction

234
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,919
Down at the bottom of the page there's a number in red

235
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
This is like Tristan's bank account

236
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
A fake money

237
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,319
The money by the way has this warm fuzzy sounding name

238
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Shares

239
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
What is this a right here yeah it says available shares at the moment I have 5439

240
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Chairs

241
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:42,143
You can kind of you shares I I view it as like Monopoly money

242
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,983
Everyday feeding America gives Tristan some fake

243
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Money in his bank of

244
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
And there's a formula so that the

245
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,359
The food banks that feed the most people will get the most

246
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
Make money on a typical day Tristan's Food Bank

247
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
Gets a few thousand shares

248
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,783
You can think of it like an allowance yes and he can treat it like an allowed

249
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
If he wants to spend it everyday on something

250
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Little he can do that

251
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
If he wants to hoard it and splurge on something

252
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Big

253
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
I can do that too

254
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,767
Today people's up the action on his computer look through the stuff there

255
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Fanta grape soda

256
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
Polly O cheese

257
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,863
And then something catches his eye

258
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
It's a truckload of Siri

259
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,495
Clicking on here I can see that there's a lot of corn flakes

260
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
There's a little bit of Frosted Flakes on here

261
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,639
There's some Kashi cereal about a hundred thousand bucks

262
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
He says cereal is something people always

263
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
And that he doesn't get enough up

264
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
From his local.

265
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,319
He can't actually see how much the other food bank

266
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,671
And Candice and Susanna and the others they designed the system this way so the

267
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,279
The people couldn't just wait until the last second and bid one more fake dollar to get what they wanted

268
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
So it's a sealed-bid auction

269
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
You put a number in and wait

270
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
And when the options done you see if you want

271
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
The system does tell Tristan that on average

272
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
Truckloads of cereal like

273
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Is 1/2 Old

274
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
For 4004

275
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,407
I currently have about 5400 chair so I'm going to

276
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,223
Did all my Shares are going all-in

277
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
Yeah I'm going to go all in and

278
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
Is even going all-in this is

279
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
No guarantee that I'll get it

280
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
Tristan Thompson is Bid

281
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Click submit

282
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Now it's a waiting game

283
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
Crossing fingers and hoping for the

284
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
I asked Justin to show me some of the other stuff

285
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Set sold at auction

286
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
And you pulled up a bunch of results on a

287
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
What's this one pickles pickles what was surprised they put in a bit of - two

288
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
2000 - 200

289
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,663
For stuff that's really unpopular food banks don't want to pay the truck it in

290
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
They don't want to find a place

291
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Place to store it

292
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,503
So they can bid negative share

293
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
In other words they can say sure

294
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
I will take the pickles

295
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,879
If you will give me extra fake money

296
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
That's what happened with the pig

297
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:46,815
So they want it by saying it will take it off your hands if you pay us exactly few minutes after Tristan bid on that cereal

298
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
This morning's auction is over

299
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,399
I think the results should be in if we

300
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
I'm nervous are you nervous I'm a little nervous

301
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
Tristan Hicks

302
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Refresh

303
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
So we lost it

304
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,847
You didn't get someone else

305
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,919
Oneness load with 11500

306
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,711
4shared the winter bit

307
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Twice as much as

308
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,039
Someone in Evansville Indiana

309
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Christopher Bank

310
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
Yes I am trying to reach John please

311
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
This is him

312
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
This is John strain

313
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
The tri-state

314
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,583
Food Bank proud new owner of 100000 boxes of Siri

315
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,167
Was there a particular reason right now that you especially wanted cereal

316
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
I just knew that we were down

317
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Tug

318
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,543
Basically about to have a trailer full of cereal and it goes

319
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
It is probably will be gone

320
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Next two weeks

321
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
John actually gets

322
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Less fake money allowance

323
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Everyday Ventura

324
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
But he's been saving up for a week

325
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,855
And he was about to run out of cereal this food that everybody really wants

326
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,951
At the breakfast to supper at midnight if it doesn't matter when you keep cereal you know

327
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,487
Heated dry YouTube milk

328
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Ideal whatever

329
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
So whatever makes you happy

330
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
He figured it was worth it to go big

331
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
It's been more than twice the average

332
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
And get that c

333
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
Tristan in New Jersey two sides

334
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
He really needs cereal

335
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
He can save up to

336
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,079
His own monster bit up the next time we're cornflakes

337
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Come up for auction

338
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:08,223
John and Justin are too new to remember much about that old system back when feeding America just

339
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Send people stuff

340
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,319
But it seems like the new system is definitely in

341
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:18,207
Suzana Morgan said the auction system that they could finally get produce at the food bank and I laugh

342
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
I can has the economist

343
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,839
Tommy even John Arnold the Socialist from Michigan even he came

344
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,911
He went from being the most skeptical

345
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
To being somebody who actually thought it was worth doing

346
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Wait what happened

347
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
I think what he realized was the use of this Market

348
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,151
Would give him access to a lot of really cheap food

349
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:42,271
So what other food banks were in bidding wars over serial John Arnold could swoop in and

350
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
Pick up the stuff that everybody else

351
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Was ignoring

352
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
And he became what we call the bottom feeders

353
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,183
He was one of these guys and login every morning

354
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
See what was Chief catlos office

355
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:57,375
And his solution was sent you the market allows me to get a lot of pounds of food in a way that I did not get before

356
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,215
And when Candace says John would login and see what was cheap

357
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
He of course means

358
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,543
What was cheap in fake money

359
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
What are the really interesting things that has emerged from this

360
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
System is just how different prices are in this

361
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,271
Fake money Food Bank economy compared to the you know

362
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
Real money economy we see if the grocer

363
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,647
I like peanut butter is incredibly valuable in the

364
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Food Bank economy

365
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
The last forever because

366
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
Refrigerated and it is a great source of protein

367
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
Also kids love it

368
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
A truckload of peanut butter can cost

369
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Tens of thousands of Cher

370
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
Dairy on the other hand

371
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
Really cheap in the food bank

372
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
Lots of food banks get local donations of dairy

373
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,871
Captain have to move it pretty quickly cuz has you know short expiration dates

374
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
Target store cuz you have to keep it refrigerated

375
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
Soap up in Michigan Candice's

376
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
John Arnold could buy a lot of dairy

377
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,111
And in the end John Arnold really help the system

378
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
Take off all around the country

379
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,231
He was a very persuasive figure because I think a lot of the other food bank director said

380
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
If he's in I'm in

381
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,583
Cuz I thought he was unlikely to be a candidate to go a long way

382
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
If the Socialist is yet on the market system how bad could it

383
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Exactly

384
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,519
There was one part of the new system that did not

385
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
We'll have that part of the story

398

When Candace and Susanna and the others were in that room

399
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Creating this news

400
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
They figured food banks should be able to

401
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
Cell food to each other for fake

402
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
So that Idaho food bank with all the potatoes

403
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:43,359
Could sell them to Susana in Alaska and get fake money to buy whatever they needed in Idaho

404
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,175
But when they took that idea to the people at all the food banks

405
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
They found that

406
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,015
Even though they're okay with buying stuff for fake money

407
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,087
They don't really want to sell stuff to other food

408
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
John strain

409
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
Who bought the cereal for that food bank in Indy

410
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,791
If I'm a food bank and I have extra product I'm going to share with another food bank I don't want no exit

411
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Germany Nordic nothing out of it

412
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
I've shared with five different

413
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
In the last

414
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,471
60 days I just think you should share what you got if you got

415
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
Funny so okay food bank directors are

416
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
Fundamentally generous people

417
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
That's why they're running food banks right and that is

418
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
Part of the reason this

419
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
This corner of the market in Everett

420
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,247
But Susan Morgan says

421
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
There is something else

422
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
Something subtler

423
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
Really another kind of a car

424
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
This is a network built on relationships

425
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,511
If you work at a food bank she says you need to have friends at other

426
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
You're going to rely on those people for more than just food

427
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:41,727
You're going to rely on those people for stealing their good fundraising practice

428
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,543
Advertising the positions that you have open

429
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
So those people are your vest

430
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,431
Source of of learning and contacts

431
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,759
Can you can use food as one of the ways you nurture those relationship

432
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Susannah's never running the Oregon food

433
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
And she said she does occasional use

434
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
Sell food to other

435
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
But not often

436
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,231
She says she would much rather just

437
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Give it away to another

438
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:15,007
