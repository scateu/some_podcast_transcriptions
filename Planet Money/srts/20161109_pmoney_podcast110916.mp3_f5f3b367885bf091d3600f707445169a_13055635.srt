That is how much the S&P 500 dropped last night

42
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,680
When it started to look like Donald Trump had won the US

43
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,264
Yeah and so the S&P 500 that's the US Stock Market

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,616
Are the stock market itself is closed in the middle of the night but there's this overnight futuristic

45
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,200
But the bottom line is this measure the Traxxas stock market it was tanking

46
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,528
Michael Farr was watching this all go down from his house in

47
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,112
Florida use a head of investment firm Farr Miller & Washington

48
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
When it started to become clear

49
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,792
That we were not going to have president-elect Clinton and we were going to have president-elect

50
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Trump the markets

51
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840

55
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,728
Midnight last night the sentiment was sell everything

56
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,776
You ever owned and move to Canada

57
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
There are a couple reasons this was happening

58
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,152
The first thing is just that the markets don't like it when something unexpected

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,784
Clinton was expected to win and a trump Victory meant all kinds of things the market hadn't really planned on

60
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,344
Trump had said all of these really

61
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,648
Stream just erratic things

62
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
During the campaign

63
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:42,048
You know that one of the debates on national TV he threatened to lock up Hillary Clinton

64
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,632
And of course he talked about dissolving trade deals with other countries in

65
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:50,240
Starting something like a trade war with China so it's 3 in the morning

66
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
All around the world

67
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Kind of panic

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
Futures markets are way down

69
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
And then Trump comes on TV

70
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
To give his victory speech

71
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
And Michael is watching

72
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
Hillary is worse

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
Very long and very hard

74
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,624
Over a long period of time

75
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
And we owe her

76
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,000
A major debt of gratitude for her service

77
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
2 hour

78
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,352
Country I mean that very sincerely

79
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
It was

80
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Conciliatory

81
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
It was statesmanlike

82
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,544
It was gracious towards secretary Clinton

83
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
It was inclusive

84
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,152
It was a very good moment for him where he

85
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
Actually appeared presidential

86
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,760
And the Futures as he was speaking

87
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
Started to rise

88
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Now it's time

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,416
For America to bind the wounds of division

90
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
Have to get together

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,816
A Michael says producers there was one other line in Trump speech that was especially important

92
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
I want to tell

93
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
The world community

94
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,472
That while we will always put America's interests first

95
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
We will deal fairly

96
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
With everyone

97
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,568
With everyone

98
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
Call people

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
And all other nations

100
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,224
Michael says that speech changed

101
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,064
Are the time trading started this morning the markets were up

102
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
The entire drop Adventure Race

103
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,184
But they're still this question hanging over every

104
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
So is the question now like

105
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
Is President Trump going to be the

106
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,655
The Statesman he appeared to be in the victory speech last night or the

107
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,031
Candidate he was that was less statesmanlike in that made the markets drop

108
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Please

109
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,455
Answer that question for me and everybody else and America's will cuz we're all on the edge of our seats are we

110
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
I mean that's the question

111
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
That's what we all want to know

112
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
Will the real Donald Trump please stand up

113
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,927
So I think this could mean that

114
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:49,535
We may be just one erratic speech away from another huge drop

115
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
Jacob you have our next indicator

116
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
Baidu our next indicator is

117
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
20

118
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,639
As of right now it's Wednesday afternoon

119
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,479
It takes 20 Mexican pesos to buy 1 USD

120
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,855
We talked about this with Anna azuara she's an analyst at a bank in Mexico called Banco bus

121
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,183
And she told us a few months back people started noticing some

122
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,767
The peso was tracking the polls of the US election

123
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
When Donald Trump started to do well in the pool

124
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Ben the mick

125
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,471
Mexican peso started to get weaker and when Hillary Clinton did better in the polls

126
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
The peso got stronger

127
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
That's because people were looking at Trump

128
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,711
Trade policies Blake getting rid of NAFTA the trade deal between the US and Mexico

129
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
The worst deal ever

130
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,063
Yashow people heard him say this and I thought so if Trump wins

131
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
This is going to be bad for Mexico

132
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,255
And you know the fact that the peso was falling clearly means that people believe that Trump would do what he said he was going to do

133
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,583
Everything he has said about the NAFTA is

134
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
It's bad for the economy

135
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
So

136
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
Yah mean

137
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,983
This friend money that it's going to jail

138
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
Get out of Mexico

139
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,615
Antoinette foreign money gets out of Mexico the peso gets weaker

140
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:13,759
Last night on a left the office went home and watched the u.s. election results roll in on her teeth

141
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
She's All That Trump was going to win

142
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
And she felt like millions of other

143
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
People in Mexico

144
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
We're watching them

145
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
He was feeling disappointed and

146
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Worried about

147
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
The future of that's what's going to happen

148
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
What's going to happen to Mexico

149
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
Yeah

150
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Unlike

151
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
Millions of other people in Mexico

152
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
Anna also pulled out her phone

153
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
To check the currency

154
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
And then I saw

155
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,895
How the Mexican peso was getting weaker on my cell phone

156
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,479
As I'm sitting there watching TV and checking her phone late at night in

157
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
Traders in a jar frantically selling peso

158
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,391
In fact the value of the peso fell by about 10% overnight

159
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
That is the biggest fall in 22 years

160
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
According to writer

161
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
Honda says it has everything he says he's going to do

162
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,607
Mexico may fall into a recession in the next

163
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,311
Robert Smith you have our final

164
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Trump in

165
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,895
I will take over Jacob seat and deliver it

166
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
To you

167
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
Are Trump indicator

168
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Number

169
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
For today

170
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
And I'm cheating a little bit here

171
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Care because it is not

172
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,391
Actually number for today at the number that is weighing heavy

173
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
On the hearts and minds of investors

174
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,255
Today and that number comes from Allen Cole

175
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
An economist

176
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
From the tax Foundation

177
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
1.5 trillion dollars / 2

178
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
1 + 1/2

179
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
Trillion dollars over 10 years

180
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,591
Robert I love this number because it represents in ongoing mystery about Donald Trump's tax

181
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,895
Pants that nobody has been able to solve

182
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,223
Text Economist like Alan Cole a man

183
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
I should say who is xian the rare ability

184
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,599
To intimidate Donald Trump a little bit just a little bit

185
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,415
The story goes back to a simpler time

186
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
15

187
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,511
Donald Trump is a candidate that no one is taking very seriously

188
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Except

189
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
The tax Foundation

190
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:07,167
They're nonpartisan group that basically runs the numbers on the candidates tax plan

191
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
I got assigned to Donald Trump

192
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,311
408 days ago not that he's Counting

193
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,127
And the time Donald Trump was promising to cut

194
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Everyone gets it

195
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
You get a tax cut

196
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:23,551
And you get a tax cut the richest people in the country we're going to get their taxes cut by more than

197
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,671
Third and uncle's job was to add up how much all this tax-cutting would cost the Federal Gov

198
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
So he took

199
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
All of everyone's income in the United States

200
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
You expect over the next 10 years

201
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
Kiwi jiggered the tax rates

202
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
Data to the numbers and

203
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Whoa

204
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Final

205
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Number

206
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Look like

207
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,799
The biggest tax cut in history

208
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,615
That number was filed trillion dollars

209
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
Did you recheck your mouth

210
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,967
Oh yeah I looked at this up

211
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,783
You know I saw that number and I thought well that's

212
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
Really really big

213
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,671
0 somewhere

214
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Yeah

215
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
In order to pay for a

216
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
12

217
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
Trillion-dollar

218
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
Tax cut

219
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
You would either have to borrow a lot of money

220
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
Increase

221
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Is the national debt

222
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Or

223
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
You would have to cut government

224
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,799
Spending something close to a quarter of the federal budget

225
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
25%

226
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
It just slashed right off the top

227
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,407
Alan publishes this number it is a

228
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
Huge news story

229
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
At first Trump tries to argue with it

230
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
Then he tries to ignore it

231
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
And then

232
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
After getting criticism on that

233
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
He started to

234
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
Considered new things and

235
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Throughout

236
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,815
2016 there were rumors of

237
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
A

238
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
Smaller more compact tax cut

239
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
You may be

240
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
One of the few people

241
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
In the world

242
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
Who is change Donald Trump's mind until

243
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
I do think about that

244
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,711
I think one thing about this is that

245
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
On policy he's prep

246
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Morflex

247
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
Possible then he gets credit for

248
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,391
And it's only one someone tells him something like

249
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,719
His businesses are bad or his buildings are bad

250
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,279
Then you know he will be very

251
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Adamantly

252
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,143
Defending himself super upset with that yeah yeah yeah

253
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
Personal

254
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
Policy personal

255
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,311
And so Donald Trump came up with a new text

256
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
A plan that would also make sure

257
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
Did you had the last laugh

258
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
On Allen

259
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,527
Just like the first plan this new plan also cut taxes for just about every

260
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Very large

261
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:37,183
But the rich don't get quite as big of a tax cut I mean the richest people in the US still do benefit the most

262
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Ghost from the Trump

263
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,815
Oh yeah I mean the average incomes are going to do very well under the Trump tax plan but

264
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
Overall the cost of the plan is

265
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,191
Half of the planet initially proposed

266
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:53,311
Although we're not entirely sure because Trump made it so that Allan Cole could not add up the total cost of

267
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,615
The plan and publish one big number again

268
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,455
And he did this by starting to say two contradictory things

269
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,503
Yeah what do we talk to small business

270
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
Trumpet say oh I'm going to cut

271
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
The corporate tax rate

272
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
But not just for corporations

273
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,927
Also for small businesses like

274
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Mom and pop places

275
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
The file very simple tax return

276
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
Is it you

277
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
You are going to get a

278
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
Big break just like the

279
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
The big Corporation

280
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,447
Obviously small business people were really excited about

281
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
But when asked about it later by reporters and tax analyst

282
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Trump seems like

283
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
No we're not going to do that not at all

284
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
Why would you think that

285
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
We've been calling it Schrodinger's tax cut

286
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
It exists

287
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,039
But it also does not exist at the same time

288
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,111
If you pick one or the other it makes this huge difference

289
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,927
In the budget tax revenues could go up

290
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
Or go down by

291
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
That number

292
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
That we picked

293
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
At the indicator at the very beginning

294
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,863
1.5 trillion dollars / 2

295
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
That's a big gap

296
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:55,775
References to small business tax cuts were quietly removed from Trump's website a couple of months

297
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
The election

298
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,639
And reporters had a hard time getting a straight answer about whether or not you still being

299
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,991
We are still watching for it and if you want to watch for it to you should know that these

300
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
Small businesses affected by the cut

301
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Are technically called

302
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Pass-through entity

303
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,951
Which is weird saying I know it's about how their income gets tax pass-through entities

304
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
But you might want to hear this term now that Trump is

305
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Is the president

306
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
Or not

307
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
No one knows

308
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,423
Eventually if Trump wants to change the tax code you will have to go through

309
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,287
To Congress and Republicans control both houses so they might be open to the bigger tax cut option

310
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
Forbade might decide to go with the smaller

311
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
Eventually someone is going to have to make a decision on Schrodinger's tax-cut they're going to have to pick one of the two options

312
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
And actually write down

313
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,111
Once things are written down in legislative tax

314
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
You can't have that at

315
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Ambiguity

316
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
And that's something that they're going to have to wrestle with

317
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
And then finally

318
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Finally

319
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
Alan can sit down

320
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
And he can do the back

321
00:12:54,655 --> 00:13:00,799
