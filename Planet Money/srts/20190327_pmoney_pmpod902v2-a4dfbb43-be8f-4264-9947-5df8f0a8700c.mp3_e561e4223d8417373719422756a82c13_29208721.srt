00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,304
Hey it's Allie home

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,840
Sure is something

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:04,608
Suspicious

4
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,144
Dubai products

5
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,680
Your cell phone could be

6
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,472
Washing machine

7
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,264
And it works

8
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,568
Just fine until

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,616
Right after the warranty expires

10
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,664
Now you got to buy a whole new one

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,688
And you feel like

12
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,968
Did the company

13
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,760
Land for it to break

14
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,040
Right then

15
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,600
There's a term that gets hot around about this

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,416
Planned obsolescence

17
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
And I'm looking into this for Planet Money

18
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
I realized

19
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,792
It's really a hysteresis

20
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
2 history

21
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,864
Three stories in one

22
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
End

23
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,728
We have a new podcast. NPR that takes history stories

24
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,752
And make something

25
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,824
Vivid and related to things that are happening today

26
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
Call through line

27
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,432
It's hosted by run data and RAM teen Arab Louie

28
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,224
So

29
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,528
Talked them about my idea and

30
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
We

31
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,576
Teamed up on this episode

32
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,648
Today's episode is a sample of through line

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
And a story about how planned obsolescence

34
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744
Began and

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,512
Spread

36
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:08,864
And how it kind of explains a huge part of the economy today

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Run

38
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:11,936
Brompton

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,520
I'm going to start the story in the 1990s

40
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,056
In Germany

41
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
With us

42
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Small group of

43
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
Book nerd

44
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
And they were nerds about one bucket

45
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,296
By Thomas pynchon

46
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
Thomas pynchon

47
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,928
Is Rainbow Comics terrifying incident

48
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,488
It faces The Odyssey of the anti-hero

49
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816
Stationed in London during World War II

50
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Language

51
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,656
Explicit descriptions of sex

52
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
Do you guys know this book

53
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,264
I don't like one of those cult classic books

54
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,056
It's like 700 pages long

55
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:54,688
Paranoid has like you know technical details about rocket science

56
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
Gravity's rainbow with something like

57
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
The Bible for circle of friends so we're really delving into the history of the noble and

58
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:08,256
Everett absolutely fascinated by the fiction that's Marcus

59
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
He and two of his friends were obsessed with this one book in particular because

60
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,216
They were all sort of technically minded people

61
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
What is the machine gun Marcus had studied the Dewey Decimal System so you don't machines

62
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,480
Systems conspiracy theories the same sort of thing that pension was right about

63
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
So this book was grateful for intense discussions drinking tea together

64
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:41,280
Smoking dope together a trip to the countryside together spending the whole weekend talking about

65
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
Light bulbs with in beautiful nature they would spend the whole weekend talking about light bulbs

66
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:54,080
Light bulbs story within the story of gravity's rainbow

67
00:02:54,336 --> 00:03:00,480
Did they were really intrigued by a small history of an eternal

68
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
Light bulb called Byron the bulb in eternal light bulb

69
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:13,280
Perfectly build so it cannot just die its Eternal in the book

70
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
Is conscious and he knows that he is going to live forever but he also knows

71
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:26,080
That there is a group of people out there who are trying to get him it is a group of light bulbs

72
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:32,480
Packers called Feebas know that obviously

73
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:38,880
Sophie learns about Byron and

74
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
Try to destroy him clearly fiction once you're familiar with

75
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
You know that

76
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
Could only

77
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Fiction books

78
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
It's very much based on fact

79
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,008
So the history of the Eternal Light Bulbs sounds like

80
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,544
Pure Fantasy

81
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
But if you dig a little bit into history

82
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
It turns out that pinching hat

83
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Sources

84
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
So

85
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
That is what they talked about.

86
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
Which parts of this

87
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
Totally farfetch

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
Seeming story

89
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
Might actually be true

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
And he started asking solve this question

91
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
Could there be a light bulb that could live forever

92
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
I'm going to say no

93
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Really

94
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Because

95
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Recall that this is

96
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Podcast

97
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,287
And I am forced to reveal at this moment but in fact there is a light bulb

98
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
That lives forever

99
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
At least

100
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,407
I mean almost forever forever as it's been burning since 1901

101
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Which is almost a hundred and eight

102
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
18 years

103
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
And

104
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:44,159
I went out to Livermore California to meet it

105
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,511
Battery repair

106
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
Shut the light bulb

107
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,863
I thought you flew across the country to look at

108
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,631
Oappl

109
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,215
I flew across the country to see a light bulb to interview a lightbulb

110
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
I talked to Tom brammell

111
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Hyzaar

112
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Retired Deputy fire chief

113
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Anna Livermore

114
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Fire station

115
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
This is a hand blown bulb

116
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,063
And when it was manufactured there was a secret formula that they used

117
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
On the carbon filament

118
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
Secret formula

119
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,903
Which is still Secret

120
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
Today

121
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,535
This bulb has been burning continuously

122
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
18 years so

123
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,143
Obviously no one has broken it open to figure out what

124
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
Exactly is going on

125
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
We do know that there is

126
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Carbon involved

127
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,567
The carbon filament was so hard they said it would reach this

128
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
The density of a diamond

129
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
What kind of magical light bulb

130
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,479
Last for more than a hundred years yeah I'm

131
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807
Has lasted for so long

132
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,927
And I literally have a lightbulb in my bathroom that we put in 6 months ago when we moved in

133
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,487
How do we go from

134
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
The eternal light bulb

135
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
To run deadline

136
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
I mean

137
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Light bulb business

138
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Actually

139
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Soap

140
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
In 1879 Thomas Edison

141
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
This is what is

142
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Is the first

143
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
Commercially viable light

144
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Light bulb and

145
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,943
By 1901 when this long last

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
Bulb burst

147
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Turns on

148
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
The light bulb market

149
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Is booming

150
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
Companies are innovating

151
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
And there are lots of little light bulb manufacturer

152
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
I'll try to make the best light bulb that they

153
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
So that's kind of like the

154
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
The first link

155
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
In the Pinta

156
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
10 story

157
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
Because there was this

158
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,143
. where companies were making

159
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
Very

160
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,679
Durable

161
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Light bulbs

162
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
Allah Byron the Everlasting

163
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
So that is step one

164
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Now

165
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
Marcus goes looking for the next

166
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
Lincoln

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
He wants to find

168
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
The people out to get Byron

169
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Exactly

170
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
PCS the name Phoebus

171
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
Is come up in a few places like

172
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
Like it's in this one book

173
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
But then one of Marcus's

174
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Just friends

175
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
Has an idea

176
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
Why don't you check out the archives of osram

177
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
Which was the biggest light bulb manufacturer in Germany

178
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
And there was a huge

179
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
Trove of documents

180
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Right there in Berlin

181
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:18,015
Marcus go searching archive system you can see who was reading the files before

182
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,575
Who discovered that nobody has

183
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,391
Files for decades

184
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
W 1st

185
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Joseph

186
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Through those

187
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
Original documents which is

188
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
Trimming and

189
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
Document after document

190
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
There it is

191
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
The Phoebus

192
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,495
Cartel cartoon named Phoebe

193
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,895
Phoebus cartel

194
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:51,295
Eating to make long-lasting bulbs things have changed

195
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:57,695
The market has gotten really Consolidated and they're a bunch of big light bulbs companies that are basically controller

196
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:03,839
Company Delon was governing the whole Market in France and Hungary.

197
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:08,447
General Electric had a branch for the UK was wrong was in German

198
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,775
That of course is more less Paradise

199
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
For an industry

200
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
If you have no computer to sad all you can do everything with the consumers because they totally

201
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
Imagine

202
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
The early 1920s

203
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,951
You're looking at a map of the world you could go through and write the name of a lightbulb monopolist

204
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:35,583
The countries that they control they all have their territory which is great for them

205
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
Pixar perfect in fact 1923 at least in particular for that German company off

206
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,567
Pretty bad here for sales

207
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:50,175
I'm head of Austrian is this guy named William meinhardt

208
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
You decide

209
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,271
A whole crew together

210
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,855
All the monopolists in all the different countries

211
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,927
In order to rule the whole world

212
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
Off the production of lightbulb

213
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
It's late December

214
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
1924

215
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Couple days before Christmas

216
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
In Geneva Switzerland

217
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
Christmas we can buy some candles flicker in the windows

218
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:23,967
Dunedin secret it's a short meeting because they've sort of already been ciatica the plan already

219
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
By the time I mean

220
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
That's if I would

221
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
Able to find it

222
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Amanda Bynes in busan

223
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,303
Purpose of a stronger Corporation

224
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,119
Especially in order to avoid

225
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
The conflict

226
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
Because of competition

227
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
And in order to increase

228
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
They are forming

229
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,591
Cartel a secret group

230
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
To control the market

231
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
The Phoebus cartel

232
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
V

233
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,527
So the name Phoebus comes

234
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
From the Greek God of Light

235
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,183
Also known as Apollo

236
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,511
You know as these gods of light

237
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
They divided up

238
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
Who electrified

239
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
World

240
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
Really boils down

241
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,263
To this one essential

242
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
Restriction that they put in

243
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:27,967
Agreed on exactly 1000 hours we intentionally have to reduce the koala

244
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Party of the Lambs

245
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
In order to increase sales

246
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
Biggest light bulb companies

247
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,391
As part of their mission to sell more light bulbs

248
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
Have conspired

249
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
To make

250
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Their products

251
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Horse

252
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
So you have to buy more

253
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
What

254
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
They all pledged

255
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
To do this

256
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Yeah

257
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
They decide

258
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
We are going to reduce

259
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
The lifespan of light bulb from

260
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Where was hovering witch

261
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Around 2000 hours

262
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
The Divide

263
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
We are going to get it down

264
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
2 1

265
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Thousand

266
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Hours

267
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
How do you even do that

268
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
Experiment

269
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
Materials are like changing the

270
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,159
The filament

271
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,999
I mean you have to imagine that for a long time at the engineer that is

272
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Companies were

273
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,047
Trying to make light bulbs

274
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Better

275
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
And what Marcus is in somebody's documents is

276
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Engineer's

277
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
Comparing notes

278
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
Going against

279
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
Alder training

280
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Now

281
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Trying to make

282
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
Products

283
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Worse

284
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,431
It actually took a few years after the agreement was signed

285
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Before they were even it

286
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:35,551
Technologically able to make the light bulb as bad as I wanted it to

287
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,111
So they figured out how to make the light bulb

288
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,927
Yeah totally they break a light bulb

289
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,999
Also obviously like it's hard to sort of get

290
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Everyone

291
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Around the world

292
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
To do this

293
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
Because I mean think about it so in a cartel

294
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
In any cartel

295
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
You cheat

296
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
That might be good for you and bad for everyone else in the

297
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,823
Lockhart alright like if one person makes about a lightbulb

298
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Tickets are to take over

299
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,663
And the Phoebus cartel

300
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Knows this

301
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:05,759
So is that a system that basically ensures that

302
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
People are following the rules

303
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
They have

304
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
Light bulb

305
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Testing rooms

306
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
Like in a library

307
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Bookshelves

308
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
Pat Roberts books

309
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
You have

310
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Plugins

311
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
4 light bulbs I seen a picture of this

312
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,679
China magical looking there's a guy in a lab coat looking thing standing in front of

313
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,007
Glowing Rose and all the light bulbs

314
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Are numbered

315
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,847
And they are burning and the cartel has

316
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Fine

317
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,175
For the fiscal year 1929

318
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
They have

319
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Penalties

320
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
With 300

321
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
4000 Swiss Francs

322
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
Which is quite a lot considering the late 1920s

323
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,631
Of the lifespan of light bulbs around the world during this. And the lifespan just goes down and down

324
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
Epices plan

325
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Is working

326
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,591
So they were able to get down to

327
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
2000 hours

328
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
Did that translate into more profit

329
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
More Revenue

330
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,039
Yep sales were growing up they were telling more light bulbs

331
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
Anti-corruption like it's kind of impressive.

332
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,255
Wondering

333
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
There any upside for consumers

334
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
I thought this was really a

335
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Marcus says

336
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
Feebas help move us toward

337
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
A more Unified

338
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
System

339
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
He told me the reason that there is

340
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
One kind of in can.

341
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Light bulb

342
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Thread

343
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
That screws into one

344
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
End of socket

345
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
That that is partly to

346
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
What's a fetus

347
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,831
Because they did this big coordination and it end up coordinating.

348
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
Accusing topic

349
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
So

350
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
First of all General Electric

351
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
American

352
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
They were involved in the

353
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Car towing service

354
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Waze through their

355
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Diddy Riese

356
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
But they didn't have the legal trouble in the United

357
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,031
Dates for Aladdin

358
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Practices

359
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
And there's a judgement against them in 19

360
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
In the court opinion

361
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,735
A bunch of information about Feebas actually comes out

362
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
There's no we know for sure but

363
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
This might be

364
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
We're Thomas pynchon God is in

365
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Inspiration

366
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,671
But the real sword of death now

367
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
For the cartel was

368
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
World War

369
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,023
And it's for sort of obvious

370
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,119
Global cooperation among these Powers was impossible because

371
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
They were at war with

372
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:37,055
But I should be clear that for years they did succeed at this whole planned obsolescence

373
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
They made their product

374
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
Worst in order to make more money

375
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
So are we at the end

376
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Well

377
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
As the end of this

378
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
But

379
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
As I mentioned there are two

380
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,367
I came across another story from this

381
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Sam darnold

382
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Where

383
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Obsolescence

384
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
Changes shape

385
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023

00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
End

417
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:11,263
Changed my whole sense of who the villain is behind plan.

418
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Desiree charts

419
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,871
Around the same time that the light bulb story does at

420
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Turn

421
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Of the 20th century

422
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,479
Light bulbs are getting more popular in the US

423
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
And so are

424
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Automobiles

425
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
One Automobile in

426
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,743
If you went by a car in the United States you find a lot

427
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:38,143
Full of black Model Tees that all look at almost exactly the same Henry Ford said you could have it in any

428
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,543
Color as long as it's black this is Giles Slade he's the author of made to break technology an ocelot

Puffins in America

430
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:51,967
Okay so it's not the most glamorous right but what do you get when you by Henry Ford's Model T

431
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:58,367
I mean you can think of it as basically like a replacement for your horse the Driving Experience

432
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:04,767
Texas really like driving a tractor through a field these machines are very popular but this

433
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
Just like fire Machinery they're not very

434
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:13,215
Luxurious like tractors the way model T's were made and marketed

435
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
They were geared towards men

436
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
Here we go

437
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:31,903

Like Henry Ford

444
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
Blown is an electrical engineer

445
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,591
He graduate from MIT in 1895

446
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
And he becomes this

447
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
Serious

448
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,199
Single-minded businessman

449
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,063
Wondering what you wrote about him made this list of his character traits including

450
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
Works every hour

451
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
Has no Hobbies

452
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
Never reads

453
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Never drinks

454
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
Never tell stories

455
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Sounds like

456
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
Cold front

457
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,191
You want take this outside right now

458
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,775
Phone genius so you know I don't know baby.

459
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,919
In one of his first jobs Sloan basically

460
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
We saved

461
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
A failing company

462
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,271
And by 1918

463
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
Keys copy II

464
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
General

465
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Motors

466
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
GM is

467
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
Meaning of failing but struct

468
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Because

469
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
The carpus is half of 19

470
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
Henry Ford has already sold the car till like

471
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,887
Many of the people who would want to buy one

472
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,191
So why would they buy a car

473
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
Don't have some ideas

474
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
First stop

475
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
He introduced

476
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Different make

477
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
A Luxury Line

478
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,199
What kind of Premium line

479
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
Middle-class line

480
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
Four door sedans for families

481
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
And then an economy line

482
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,903
The very cheap you know 1923 Chevy

483
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
All American

484
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
Chevrolet

485
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,351
Wonder what the new Chevrolet is going to be like

486
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,143
A knife of the new ones are going to

487
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
This is a

488
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,359
And then just looking at the data on who is

489
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Is buying things

490
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,687
Not necessarily cars just stinks

491
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:35,807
Marketing and advertising firms that began the first real demographic research in the teens

492
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,879
And what they discovered around 1920

493
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,535
Was the women were actually spending the family money making 85% of all purchases

494
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,607
Model T was plain simple and

495
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,935
Made for men to Sloane realized

496
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,591
He could sell more by doing a lot of things that Henry Ford would never think of doing it like

497
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:03,967
Making a much more comfortable experience to start and ride in a car

498
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
And also making it much more to start experience by you know having different color cards

499
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
Colors

500
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:16,255
Was huge because before this car is recovered in a lacquer

501
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,583
But just like did not hold colors all that well Legos

502
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,983
Black Fade to Yellow it was not really working the black was the most practical most permanent

503
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
1920s

504
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:33,663
This company Dupont which was an investor in GM they sent a fortunate trying to create durable color

505
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,063
Word means and in 1923 they succeeded in the next few years as Sloan

506
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,391
Rolled out new models and don't women they were all day

507
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
Same paint breakthrough actually also leads to nail polish as we know it

508
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,095
Nail polish in carpet

509
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:58,495
We're the same thing but yes

510
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
Discolored

511
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,615
I mean this is she is wondering

512
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,711
Can I sell the same basic machine

513
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:14,111
Just in a radically different package we make the superficial things the key things of the past

514
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,720
The fins on the back of betta radio new upholstered

515
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:23,072
All the sorts of accessories the kind of what would have been considered

516
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:27,168
Frivolous things they become essential that we won

517
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,496
The consumer to buy a new car every year

518
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,592
Gottschalk ready author of the book the deals that made the world

519
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,456
Overtime GM tries out different looks they lower the cars body

520
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,784
They elongate the hood it has crazy curve

521
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,136
Billy change the engine but eventually you can get the car in blue

522
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,208
Or red or green

523
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,864

538
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
Blown is busy making cars

539
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Sexy

540
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
But they weren't like

541
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Breaking the car

542
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360

Feebas

544
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
None of the cars work

545
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
It's just that they were

546
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,016
Obsolescence psychologically

547
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
Obsolescence

548
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
In the sense of

549
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
Fashion

550
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
So it would seem

551
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:51,904
Radically

552
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,952

554
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,120
So am I 1927

555
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
Henry Ford

556
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:06,496
Was forced to stop production of this Maltese

557
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,056
And revamp his entire Manufacturing

558
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,080

559
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104

560
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,736
The Woodland compete with General Motors product until he came up with a new Ford Model A

561
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:23,136
Not only work for so long and eventually he was forced to bring out two different lines in different colors in face

562
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
Copy GN

563
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
Who won the consumer report

564
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,376
Chevrolet must have a new advertising

565
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:42,080
Awesome that will empower people to act

566
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
I bought one

567

Sloan by assuring in a whole new style of warfare

568
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,320
Psychological obsolescence

569
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:58,720
Which made the consumer wants to buy something new even if they didn't necessarily need

570
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,144
Was actually one of the first big businessmen to use the word consumer and

571
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:06,912
She realized

572
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,984
Consumers one thing cops they don't want things

573
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
Quickly enough

574
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,616
We could make them want something the newest new thing a little faster

575
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:22,016
The idea of obsolescence for something done to an object to something we ourselves we choose what we want

576
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:26,880
That was key that's not Freddy again and he says

577
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,928
Moon was like this

578
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,208
Psychological

579
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
He was figuring out all these new ways

580
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Thoroughly

581
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,096
Get inside our heads

582
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
It's the one you bought the Chevrolet Bel Air

583
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,424
It came

584
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Wiz

585
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
A catalog

586
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:42,240
4

587
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,264
The new one

588
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
It was going to be coming out

589
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,616
Set at the very moment Apache

590
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,688
They've built in a chip you know inside your head

591
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
Actually

592
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
This isn't going to be very good

593
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Because you're going to want

594
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
This new one

595
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
But even back

596
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,624
Answer this a kind of built-in disappointment

597
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
With the moments

598
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,464
The purchase I think psychological obsolescence

599
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Fashion

600
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,768
Depends on

601
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Disappointing

602
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
And that was intention

603
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,864
And that was what Sloane's genius was

604
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,680
Giles Slade says

605
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
The last part of

606
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
The psychology

607
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
In psychological obsolesce

608
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,080
How to do a something that marketers and

609
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
An advertising writer

610
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
Began doing in the night

611
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
Selling products

612
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,480
Gaston Pride

613
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
And she

614
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,832
I mean I get that like a new car

615
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Was

616
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Something

617
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
You can be proud of you.

618
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:34,464
Driving down the street in an old beat-up one was

619
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,512
Something that you know you might be a little bit of

620
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
Yeah that's exactly it

621
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
Annies Sloan

622
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,400
Take these new ideas from advertising

623
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,704
And build those psychological

624
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Triggers

625
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,240
Into the

626
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,008
The products

627
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Themselves

628
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Emacs

629
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
Each new car

630
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
More desirable than the last

631
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,456
And this is what you see with the iPhone today

632
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
DIY

633
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
We have arrived at the iPhone

634
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,088
Okay run Franti

635
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
When I tell someone that I'm

636
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
Story about planets

637
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,464
They almost always say sorry about that

638
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
So

639
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
We'll talk about it

640
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
The battery

641
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
The battery

642
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
So maybe you heard about this

643
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,424
Conspiracy theory

644
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Controversy

645
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,288
In 2017 iPhone users were noticing that

646
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,592
After they had updated their software

647
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,128
Their phones started

648
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
To slow down

649
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
What does Prost

650
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,528
Supposed to make your phone better and some people felt like it was making

651
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,344
So people started yelling at Apple about this

652
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
And apple said

653
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,208
We're actually doing this for your own good

654
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,280
We're not bringing the phone we're not trying to shorten its lifespan

655
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,352
But if we slow down some older phones

656
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
They don't crash it

657
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,192
We're sorry we didn't mention it

658
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,472
And apple offers a

659
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
A cheap battery replacement

660
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Sweeten the apology

661
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
Well I mean

662
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Kind of sounds like

663
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
Planned obsolescence modern-day fever

664
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
I mean

665
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,736
Look Apple totally denies that they were doing this

666
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
Aster drive upgrade

667
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:06,112
But if you believe that Apple slow down older phones in order to make

668
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
People by X

669
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
New phone

670
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,208
10 job that would be a perfect

671
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,232
Example of plane.

672
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
Everything is we don't really know if that's

673
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
There's a lawsuit about this right now

674
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Also in France

675
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
Frantically have a law against

676
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
Planned obsolescence

677
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,728
But

678
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,752
Progress

679
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,288
We don't know exactly how it'll turn out

680
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,848
And you know I mean apple has a reasonable case

681
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
Make about why they do

682
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
However

683
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
I think

684
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,248
Pick n Save for 100% sure

685
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
The apple is

686
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
A modern.

687
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Faster

688
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
Alfred Sloan styles

689
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:40,416
Psychological

690
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
This is the new iPhone

691
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,792
And it lets you do some pretty incredible things

692
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
If you don't have an iPhone

693
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
You don't have the right

694
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,424
This is iPhone 6s

695
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
Not much has changed

696
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,104
Except a new color looks like this it's rose gold opossum

697
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
I have to admit for a long time

698
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,992
I was a sucker for this I feel like when we find ourselves wanting

699
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
New phones

700
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Really wanted

701
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,600
Feeling like we almost need them

702
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,392
It's really tempting to think

703
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
There's a Sinister plot behind

704
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,744
Totally I hate ya

705
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
Like you know we imagine

706
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
There's someone pulling the

707
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
Curling person in the back

708
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,424
Exactly

709
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
You know with Feebas

710
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
True

711
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,520
So it's not that far-fetched

712
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,824
Psychological obsolescence

713
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
Is it with Albert Sloan.

714
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
We can't blame.

715
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
Shady cartel

716
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
We all know that that's happen

717
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,272
Is something inside

718
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
Get in the car

719
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,368
Drive to the Apple Store and standing

720
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,136
Long

721
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
What to get a new phone with

722
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
Facial recognition

723
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,232
Bright like we are cooperate

724
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
Just iPhone

725
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
This is Beijing

726
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120

727
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,888

728
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,168

731
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
And look

732
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
GM used to be the biggest

733
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
Over the past

734
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
Couple years Apple has

735
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Often been the

736
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Panini America

737
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,480
Psychological obsolescence is not just some

738
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
Cute

739
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,296
Clever marketing scheme

740
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,600
And it's not just some trick

741
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
It's being pulled on us

742
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
But I do like

743
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,976
Came into this story thinking of planned obsolescence

744
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:19,744
Incise

745
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,560
You know something that company

748
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
But the most

749
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,704
Powerful kind of obsolescence

750
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Is it

751
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,056
We are choosing this ourselves

752
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:40,480
I don't think I could stop it if we wanted to
