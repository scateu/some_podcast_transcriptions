00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,608
10 years ago in early September 2008

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,912
We still had no idea how bad it was

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,728
The housing crisis was picking up steam

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,264
But Lehman Brothers

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
Han collapse

6
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,360
The financial Panic hadn't spread through the banks

7
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,640
Through the whole world

8
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,688
And at that moment

9
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,456
That is when

10
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,016
Planet Money launched its first episode

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:34,560
We are going deep into the archives so deep that some of the podcast players don't even go back that far

12
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,888
We're going to revisit our very first episode

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,984
Summer will be covered back that has changed and in some interesting ways

14
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
But a lot of it

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,032
Hold up

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
Wait more than I expect

17
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,640
First episode sounds like an experiment

18
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Because

19
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,432
It was

20
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,504
It's about the trade deficit with China

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,320
How exactly the dollars flow back and forth

22
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,392
Giant Loop changing what they pay for at each step

23
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:05,792
The end of today show will have an update on how the story is changed and about which predictions came true

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,656

After the break our very first episode

30
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,880
Support for this podcast and the following message come from Madewell

31
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Where the motto is

32
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
Good days start with

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
Straight jeans

34
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,024
How did they make them so great Madewell starts with

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Premium denim

37
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,960

They work with the blue jeans go green program

40

Stop by a Madewell store

45

Or go to madewell.com

46
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
I'm pretty sure you've heard this idea that China and the US are in a crazy kind of codependent relationship

47
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:12,864
We keep buying stuff from China with our dollars than China turns around and lends those dollars

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
Right back to us

49
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,704
So we can then buy some more stuff

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
China

51
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032
They want some more money to us on and on

52
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
But

53
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,456
What you might not know and I didn't know until very recently is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac those to come

54
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
Chinese you heard a lot about lately

55
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
They are Central they are crucial

56
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:37,696
To that whole recycling of money process they make it happen or at least they helped make it happen

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,560
I'm going to explain in a second but first let me tell you I am Adam Davidson

58
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,632
International economics correspondent for national

59
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
Public Radio

60
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
And I'm

61
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,288
Just starting to run something new here at NPR we're calling it Planet Money

62
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,384
And our goal is to take the big complex global economic issues

63
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
The kind of thing I think most people feel like they really should know a lot about and understand but they don't then they get

64
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
Really confused

65
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:09,184
Our job here what we're trying to do is to make this all easier for you

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
We're working really hard and

67
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
We will succeed

68
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,328
At least most of the time to help you understand

69
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
How the world economy works

70
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,912
And how it affects your life

71
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,496
And right now this right here is our first ever

72
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
Podcast

73
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
Tantrum

74
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,456
Today I'm going to talk to Brad

75
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
Used to working at a treasury

76
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Department

77
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,832
And you should be glad I'm talking to Brad because

78
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,648
He knows this financial entered the

79
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
Ending relationship

80
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
Between the US and China better than

81
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
Anyone I can think of

82
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
Over the years

83
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
He has really helped me understand how the US and China Financial system works and let me just give you the

84
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,240
The basic idea before we get to Brad

85
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,592
So you buy a DVD player t-shirt something made in China

86
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,920
You give your dollars to the store

87
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,784
They take those dollars and give them to some importer who brought the thing into the country

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
The Importer

89
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,696
Take some of that money and send a check to China to the factory that made whatever it is you bought

90
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:20,351
So think of it from the factory owners perspective he's in China he's getting all these dollars but he has

91
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:27,007
Employs his electric bills he is all this stuff in China so he doesn't want dollars he wants the Chinese currency

92
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Renminbi

93
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,943
Owner does he takes those dollars and he brings them to his local bank

94
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
There are lots of banks in China

95
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
And he says here's a bunch of dollars I want Renminbi

96
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
Now the bank has dollars

97
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,183
But they don't

98
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,999
So every day this happens every day a business day

99
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
All the local banks in China and around

100
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
For 5 in the afternoon

101
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
They send a message

102
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
It's a call or email to Central Bank

103
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,471
People's Bank of China

104
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,775
And they say we've got a lot more dollars in today

105
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
And we don't want them

106
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
We want Renminbi

107
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,943
The Central Bank says alright that's fine give us your dollars and we'll send you some

108
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
Renminbi

109
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
So every day

110
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
The People's Bank of China gets

111
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
A huge pile of new dollars

112
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
But they have to do some

113
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,767
And Brad is going to tell us in a minute how many dollars it's a lot

114
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
So

115
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
People's Bank of China

116
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Don't want to just hold on to

117
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,215
Dollars dollars don't earn interest they want some kind of investment

118
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
But they don't want any investment they don't want some

119
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,871
Speculative Tech stock or some hedge fund because there was Central Bank they need

120
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
To keep this money they need to know it's safe

121
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,295
The number one thing they want is US Government debt

122
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
Treasury bond

123
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
But believe it or not

124
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,671
However big our debt is and it is big

125
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,231
There aren't enough treasury bonds

126
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
Things to satisfy China's

127
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Hunger

128
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
The People's Bank of China by the next best thing

129
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,423
Which it turns out is Fannie Mae

130
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
And Freddie Mac

131
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Bond

132
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
Those bonds as it

133
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,079
Fan are made up of bundles of us home mortgages

134
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
Probably your mortgage Maybe

135
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,199
Put all together in a package and then sold as Bond

136
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,015
No China doesn't particularly care

137
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
That these were bonds backed by home mortgages

138
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
They just like the

139
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,951
These Bonds were considered really safe and that they gave some return

140
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
We love this process because what

141
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
Effectively is happening is every dollar we sent to China goes through this chain of people and then comes back to us

142
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,263
In the form of mortgages

143
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
Americans used

144
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
Houses home equity lines

145
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,319
The credit and they buy a lot more chinese-made stuff

146
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
You see how this Cycle Works

147
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,951
And hopefully now you see how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are Central

148
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
To this whole cycle

149
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,815
And the person who knows how all of this works better than anybody

150
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
Is Brad setser

151
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Well

152
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
Probably did some guy in The People's Bank of China by that guy

153
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
I don't know who it is and what he

154
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,591
Probably wouldn't talk to us anyway so we're very happy to have Brad

155
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
I started out by asking him

156
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,199
How big is this whole thing how much money are we

157
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
We talkin about

158
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,271
I think it is reasonable to think

159
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
The Chinese vine

160
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,111
Over the boat's over the last 12 months

161
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
Roughly 400 billion dollars in US debt

162
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
That's

163
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
A lot

164
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Over a year

165
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Over a year

166
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,023
So that's

167
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,631
I'm just doing the math is that for business-to-business

168
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
2 billion dollars

169
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Sounds like a lot

170
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
It is a lot

171
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
Is ballpark

172
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
The same size as the US fiscal deficit

173
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Is ballpark the same size

174
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,919
Import bill

175
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
It is a larger right now

176
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
Extended

177
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
Non-oil trade deficit

178
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
It is a phenomenal sum of money

179
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
I think of you

180
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,671
As the leading guy studying how much

181
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Us

182
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,231
Money China has

183
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,815
Polite way of saying I've been obsessed

184
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
With this question for The Last 5 Years

185
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,191
It's the main thing you're right about you have

186
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
With a China

187
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,359
I reserved watch spend a lot of time trying to figure out just how much

188
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,735
How large is China's purchases of us Bonds were and are

189
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
Look it up somewhere

190
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,255
I've only the world for that simple

191
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
No you actually can't

192
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,375
There

193
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Actually

194
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Cell

195
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,239
The bond directly to China central.

196
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,799
The US government sells

197
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
A lot of bonds to

198
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:51,199
The broker-dealer community the primary dealers who buy up treasuries

199
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
Fixing big Banks

200
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Thanks

201
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
Those big

202
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
Goldman Sachs

203
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
JP Morgan

204
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
You name it

205
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,999
Household names the really big

206
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
The core of the USA

207
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
Play Beautiful Audubon

208
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
And then they sell them to a bank in London

209
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,239
And in the bank in London sells the bond to china's central bank

210
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
The US contract

211
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
The amount of debt that it issues

212
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,431
And it can track the sale of bonds to foreigners

213
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
But in the first instance it thinks that it's old

214
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
The bond

215
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
2

216
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
A private financial institution in London

217
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
And has no way of knowing

218
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Then

219
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
Where that bond is that

220
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,815
Financial institution then sells the bond to China central bank

221
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,375
Is that by Design

222
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Pharmacist time zones

223
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
This

224
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:51,871
Is there a building for the guys or 4 for the guys in fishing or just on the phone to London all the time saying hey we need another

225
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,663
This is how someone explained it to me in

226
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
That at the end of every day

227
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
The reserve manager in

228
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
China institution great name

229
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,111
State administration of foreign exchange

230
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
Safe safe

231
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
The guy gets a call from other people's Bank of China says you have this today we

232
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
That we bought 2 billion dollars in the market

233
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,823
Anthonino's okay why have these Bonds mature expiring cuz I already hold you know 1.8 trillion

234
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
Reserves

235
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
There's a certain amount of that again

236
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,455
Come you only get paid on some of the loans and bonds

237
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,575
And sent at the end of the business day in China

238
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
The US is asleep

239
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
The natural thing to do is get on the phone and call London

240
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,279
So he gets on the phone and how many bonds can you sell me

241
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
I'm in that process

242
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
Goes on date

243
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
Saturday

244
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
After day

245
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Another problem

246
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,519
It's hard to track it from the US Side by looking

247
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Kathy USA.

248
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
Then you have to go to the Chinese

249
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
Chinese date

250
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,175
And try to figure out how much

251
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
China's foreign asset to Ghana

252
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
Well China central bank

253
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,343
It's actually really slow and releasing its Reserves

254
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,415
Most central banks release their reserves data at once a month

255
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
I only does it once a quarter

256
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,279
I sometimes you just publish how much

257
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,351
Publish on their website how much they hold

258
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,775
And I don't want to go into the details about how many obscure

259
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,871
Websites that you need to visit in order to try to get a good s

260
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
How much money does State Banks have

261
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,015
I don't speak Mandarin have a friend who dies and that's the only way you can

262
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Impossibly

263
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Find

264
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,159
Some reason might give you some basis for doing the estimate

265
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
What is that what you're doing all the time

266
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,071
Calling up a friend and begging them to go on the Mandarin language pboc's website

267
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,679
Yeah

268
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:57,055
So there's dozens of weird Chinese of the Chinese agricultural

269
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,151
The data on the foreign exchange Holdings of the state banking system

270
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Which is just a little bit hard to find

271
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
Yeah central banks by player

272
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,807
But it's a hard part is you never quite know where the

273
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,111
Increase is going to show up

274
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:14,719
And what day does series and sometimes it changes around a little bit of guesting

275
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
Why are you so obsessed with

276
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Why not

277
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
What what do you want to know so bad

278
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,191
Is it to me there's been a sort of a deep puzzle

279
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,495
About the global economy

280
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,847
For the past several years and you can think of that puzzle Dilaudid

281
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
One is that

282
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,527
A relatively poor country

283
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Chinese dolls

284
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,903
A relatively poor country is financing a relatively rich country

285
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,207
You might normally think that

286
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
The money would follow the other way around

287
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
And historically that's

288
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,863
Countries or country's

289
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,959
Rich Banks fun for people exactly

290
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,263
If you want

291
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,567
Right

292
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,591
Citibank was

293
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
You know some guy named Frank

294
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
Who's funding Citibank

295
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,623
But it's also a very fast growing economy

296
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Which is financing a slow-growing

297
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
She's also perhaps not

298
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
The way

299
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
Things normally work

300
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,839
I'm hearing this is an intellectual curiosity

301
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,679
You could do crossword puzzles instead you're trying to figure out

302
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:33,311
How much u.s. debt the Chinese government has its oh my God will my

303
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,151
Standard of living collapse and will the US economy fall apart its

304
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
This is really weird

305
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
I don't understand this

306
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
The initial

307
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,879
Motivation was also a little based on a concern

308
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,951
The concern was well maybe this can't go on forever

309
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,791
And then the more time you spend looking

310
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,655
And in your eye that actually written the paper saying that it couldn't go on forever

311
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,959
Make a public prediction that something

312
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Is it going to go on forever

313
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,311
And it seems to keep going on long past

314
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
The point where you said it wouldn't

315
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
You kind of get interested in

316
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,503
It becomes you know the crossword puzzle that you want to solve on a daily basis

317
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Can I go on forever

318
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
Tropicana

319
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,695
China cannot reduce the amount of financing that it provides the United States

320
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
Without inducing a Slowdown in the US economy

321
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,375
A slow down or fall and u.s. purchases of Chinese Goods

322
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
He were Chinese exports

323
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
And

324
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
I think that is a very

325
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
Important

326
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,103
Consideration that weighs very heavily

327
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
On Chinese policy-making

328
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,943
The China isn't providing all this Finance

329
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
The US

330
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Just cuz

331
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
It loves United States

332
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,463
Do they want us to have to live beyond her means That explicit interest rates low in America

333
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,559
So that I spend more on my credit card and I buy more Chinese stuff

334
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
Now if you asked China's leaders

335
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,447
Do they want the us to live beyond its meaning

336
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
I think it was a no

337
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
China's building up dollars

338
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
Castle in those dollars out

339
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:18,783
I am if you were you need someone who needs to borrow and otherwise I need to be someone in the US is living beyond their means

340
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
In order to keep

341
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,367
Current demand for Chinese Goods going

342
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
So

343
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
In that sense

344
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
The

345
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,487
Indirect effect

346
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
Of China's policy

347
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Has been

348
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,863
To encourage the US to live beyond its means

349
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,655
I think you can say that

350
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
Squats not the stated goal

351
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
You certainly the byproduct

352
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
And it's good for them

353
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
It's good for 12

354
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:47,711
Good for that other good for them are good for us there different interest inside challenge there different interest inside the US

355
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
It is good for the US Treasury

356
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,367
If China buys a ton of Treasury bonds and keeps interest rates low

357
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,671
It is bad for workers in Ohio

358
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
Producing Goods

359
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
They compete with Chinese good

360
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,351
If China's holding his currency down and taking market share away from USA

361
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,911
Same thing works in the opposite way

362
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,471
China is good for china's exporters

363
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,287
It's good for workers in the export sector

364
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
But it isn't good for China's taxpayers

365
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
Cuz I going to be taking a loss

366
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:21,759
The arguably isn't good for the workers who could be employed building schools in China

367
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Which Heineken

368
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
Buy build more of

369
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
If it

370
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,927
Borrowed more money at the government level on Resident lending it to the US

371
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
And use that

372
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
Borrowing to buy

373
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
The Biltmore

374
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
School domestically

375
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
Choices

376
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
And those choices

377
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,191
Just have different effects on different groups within each economy

378
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,751
And it's very hard to set us a

379
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,359
One side wins the other side loses parts

380
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,687
Of the two economies are impacted in different ways

381
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,527
Tomorrow

382
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,831
He doesn't care about financial

383
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,647
I care about his own economy

384
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,207
Hell-bent on using whatever power he can

385
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
To destroy a mirror

386
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,511
Now

387
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,559
Is Robert Mugabe decided that

388
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,375
I think it's safe to assume Zimbabwe does not have

389
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
The ability to destroy the US

390
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
You know

391
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
Hugo Chavez

392
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Could

393
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:23,455
Cuz I couldn't destroy it what what would China do let's just say they hired you said Brad can you destroy music on

394
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Anime forest

395
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,271
I can't destroy the US economy

396
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
I can cause a lot of damaged

397
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Wsvn

398
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
And I would say you have a very simple Ops

399
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
If you want to

400
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
Cause a great deal of disruption

401
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
To the US Financial system to the US Government Bond Market

402
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
And by implication to the US economy

403
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:47,775
You just have to stop buying a single new US government or u.s. agency Bond

404
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
If this stop

405
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
If the unsustainable

406
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
Is no longer sustained

407
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,919
China stops buying

408
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
US debt

409
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
Total collapse of capitalism

410
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
Great Depression

411
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,695
Late 70s kind of slowdown malaise

412
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
Early 2000s

413
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:15,167
Brief recession that doesn't hurt on that Continuum more late 70s

414
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,495
Then collapse of capitalism

415
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
What Great Depression

416
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Unemployment goes up

417
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
Unemployment already going up

418
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
Unemployment goes up by a lot more

419
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,271
Mid america Fields pore

420
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,623
America has to live within its means we're used to living beyond our means

421
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
Borrow last housing prices go down

422
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
Our dollars don't buy as much

423
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,095
Broad it's your new cool things like iPods

424
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
Well I think it is not fewer new cool things

425
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
I get to buy

426
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,007
You get to buy fewer new things

427
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,567
And those cool new things cost a little bit more

428
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,895
Right that the iPod may not be manufactured in China

429
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,455
I mean not yours design in California manufacturer

430
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
China famous lake

431
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
Well maybe it'll be

432
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:08,159
Design in California manufactured house in Mexico and have some California and cost twice as much

433
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
How to exaggerate a little bit

434
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
So there will be

435
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,583
So some people will benefit

436
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
Certain kinds of jobs will grow in the

437
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,167
Absolute

438
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
I mean

439
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
As you said before the people who are hurt now

440
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,335
Will no longer be hurt in the people who win at 1

441
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
But

442
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,943
It's the shift between the two

443
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
Butt cheeks

444
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Time

445
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
It takes effort

446
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
Olfactory doesn't just spring up

447
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
Magically

448
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
There's an interesting story about

449
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,207
He was in business week about it

450
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,255
An American inventor who thought they'd

451
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Dad

452
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Created

453
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
A better battery

454
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,959
For laptops and they wanted to finance new technology they want to find a manufacturer

455
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
In the US

456
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
To build

457
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
This new battery

458
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,871
Cuz I'm okay no shipping costs have gone way way way up

459
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,455
That strong a reason to have this

460
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Inside

461
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Hello cost

462
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
Manufacturing centers

463
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
Kind of language

464
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
Could be made

465
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,439
But there wasn't any contract manufacturer in the US with expert

466
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,463
He's building batteries

467
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,767
So it takes a while to build up

468
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Skills

469
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
Where's in China

470
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
Wars in China there diamond

471
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,399
So it's the difficulty

472
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,679
Hetalia by contrast

473
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
We had specialist here in the US

474
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,519
Economy who could

475
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
Take a mortgage

476
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
Really complicated features

477
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,663
Reverse amortization

478
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Variable

479
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
You name it

480
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
Package it with other mortgage

481
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
Just combined it into a bond

482
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Combine that

483
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Split that bond is different

484
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Parts

485
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,999
Combine those parts into another Bond

486
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
And sell it

487
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
Optical

488
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Work

489
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,167
Thin turnips replace broken

490
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
It was a set of skills which wouldn't be

491
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Be present in China

492
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,847
The process

493
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,151
Changing the way

494
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
What an economy produces

495
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
Takes time

496
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,295
And it is also the effect of

497
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,855
Econo what have to stop running Upper Deck

498
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:17,440
And while that's probably good in a long time since

499
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,488
In a short time since it means that

500
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Would be

501
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,536
Vial of the bus

502
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
So pretty crappy not

503
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,888
Absolute misery

504
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,288
Where were not on the lease

505
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,104
Total Doom and Gloom side of the spectrum

506
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
But at the same time

507
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
It is

508
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
I would much rather see it

509
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
A process

510
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Spyware

511
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
There's a gradual reduction

512
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,392
In China's Reliance on the US and Europe

513
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,440
Ferdinand Forest Products

514
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
Much more

515
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
Reliance on

516
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
Internal forces

517
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,096
To keep China's economy growing

518
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
And a gradual process

519
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Square

520
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,240
The US moves from a world where in order to

521
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Keep

522
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
Running a large trade deficit

523
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
Yes keep borrowing

524
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
Marge Simpson by the government

525
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,920
To a world where

526
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Trailer for the smaller

527
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,552
And that trade deficit can be financed by selling

528
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
Bonds

529
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
Private investor

530
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
But I want that process

531
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
Gradually

532
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
Suddenly

533
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Cuz if it happens suddenly

534
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
Are you coming

535
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
Unpleasant

536
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
And it's not just

537
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
Unpleasant

538
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
In Thompson's inefficient

539
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Because

540
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,240
Economy can't shift

541
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
From manufacturer

542
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032

596
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
So here are a few things

597
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,760
That are the same since that episode 1

598
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:54,784
The US

599
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,112
Still run the trade deficit a trade deficit still works the same way

600
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Have to be down somehow

601
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,816
Trade deficit still means an investment Surplus I'm going abroad buying US debt us bonds investing in the US

602
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,864
Also the same Brad setser

603
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,656
He still studying International economics

604
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
Still at the Council on Foreign Relations

605
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
So ask him what's changed

606
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,776
The thing that is changed

607
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,056
Is that China is

608
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
Start sweeping up

609
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Dollars

610
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,176
At the end of every business day in the way it was in 2008

611
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,480
China is just not buying as much

612
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,760
US debt as it used

613
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
I need

614
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
For China's government

615
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,856
Step in

616
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,928
Mumbai dollars is largely gone away

617
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
It's gone away I think

618
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
Hurt to read

619
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:40,608
The first is that China is importing a lot more oil and a lot more

620
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:44,448
Iron and a whole host of other commodities

621
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
So what

622
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,496
The dollars

623
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
China earn

624
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,336
X1bus get sent

625
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360

627
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176

628
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:54,944
That's good

629
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
And another one

630
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Private

631
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,552
Chinese citizens now

632
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
AR

633
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,368
A bit less confident China

634
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,440
Currency China's economic course

635
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,768
And the more willing to hold

636
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,072
A portion of their wealth abroad

637
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:15,680
There isn't the same kind of imbalance in the Foreign Exchange Market

638
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,776
And the crisis he was worried about if China stopped buying US Government debt

639
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,056
Didn't exactly happen

640
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,848
A bigger Crisis happen

641
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,688
First win that week after the interview aired Lehman Brothers went bankrupt

642
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
You probably know that

643
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:33,600
Since it's our birthday to do something we don't usually do

644
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368

How about we try to get a review from 2018 to be at

Helpful

658
