1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,536
This is part 3

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,304
Everspace

3
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:07,424
If you have ever wondered how you can personally send something up into space to do it

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,472
Go back a couple of episodes in ketchup

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,752
We will wait

6
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,056
Are we good

7
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,080
I think so

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,408
Here is something that surprised me about the space

9
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,456
Once you build a saddle

10
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
And decide what you wanted to do and see

11
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,296
Your Plus shopping

12
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
For rocket

13
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
To put it on

14
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
And of course

15
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,928
Anytime you're shopping for something expensive there's always a guy

16
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,720
Right there's a guy with a

17
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,488
Line

18
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:37,120
I'm kind of like your your best friend that's going to find you a rocket somewhere in the world that has X

19
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:41,472
Space rocket broker meeting if the satellite

20
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,544
The Planet Money satellite ready to go if you have a satellite

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,616
The Phil is the man who can get you a lift to space

22
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,432
He says it's just like buying any other big-ticket item

23
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:55,552
There's a car for for every consumer and there is a type of rocket for every type of satellite

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
Where you want to go

25
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,880
We might still at the small satellite conference

26
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
Sprint in Logan Utah

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,976
He handed us a card it said right on their space flight

28
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
Dot-com

29
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,560
Anything you can book rocket flights right on the web

30
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
Just like Expedia

31
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
The Rockets

32
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
You put in a bag

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
Your satellite is

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,728
Want to go and Phil will find you a lunch

35
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,800
It may take a year or so to find room for your satellite the business

36
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,080
Is booming these days

37
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
But there are a lot of places to lunch

38
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,712
New Zealand California Florida Kazakhstan japan-india

39
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
They all have Rockets ready to go

40
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
Yes

41
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
The very existence of Phil

42
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,160
The existence of this conversation shows you how much

43
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
The space business has changed

44
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,512
Decades ago satellites work massive

45
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,328
And they would go up on Rockets owned by space agency

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
It could cost a hundred million dollars

47
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
So there weren't many deal speed

48
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
Now we're in an age

49
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
Tiny satellites

50
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
It's that you can hold in the palm of your hand

51
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
Rockets can fit dozens of them

52
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
Thank you satellite could hitch a ride to space

53
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
Where is cheapest

54
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,968
$300,000 bill

55
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
The consummate salesman says

56
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,576
295000 95-99

57
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:07,232
We tell Phil about the Planet Money satellite is about the size of a loaf of bread we adopted it from the start of satellite

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
Planet

59
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,840
Who kindly let us put our name on it and still says he can totally help

60
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
Think about what you want to rock it

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
Say about

62
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
It's like picking out a car

63
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
So as a podcast going to space

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,104
First time maybe we want to pick out something classic something safe

65
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,920
Like he's just orbital ATK

66
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
I mean there on time

67
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Are reliable

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,272
Very few mishaps Volvo

69
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
That's actually a very apt

70
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,928
Description of orbital ATK it's definitely like a Volvo

71
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
Phil sister is of course

72
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
SpaceX

73
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Elon Musk

74
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
Rocket company

75
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
Takeoff

76
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,168
Land super cool right now obviously it is the Tesla of the space business

77
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Or

78
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
There is this new car

79
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
A small startup called Rocket

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
Out of New Zealand

81
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
It's still in the testing phase

82
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,432
But they have a plan to eventually launch a rocket

83
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
Every single week

84
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
There's a new Honda

85
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
Really hot

86
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
So hot so hot right now

87
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
52 launch

88
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Any year

89
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
The Price is Right

90
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
I changed the game

91
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,256
For sure so what kind of car would rocket lab

92
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
I don't know after that.

93
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,120
Top for surprisingly long time

94
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
Head of a car that was sporty and 4WD

95
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Curves

96
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,288
Like a Corvette or like one of those little sporty Miatas

97
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
Sure there's some sort of

98
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
Red sports car definitely convertible

99
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Hotness

100
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
The hotness

101
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Okay

102
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
So what is it going to be for the Planet Money sad

103
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,088
Should we pick the family sedan for sale

104
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
Or the sports car

105
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
I think

106
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
We need to take

107
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
Sol test drive

108
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:48,096
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

109
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,144
And I'm Robert Smith today on the show

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,448
What money is in the market for brand new rock

111
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Rocket shopping

112
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:58,080
There is a new space race going on the US versus the Soviet Union

113
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,688
It's dozens of tiny startup companies competing to send tiny little satellites

114
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
Indoor rabbit has become so easy to make satellite

115
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
The Planet Money satellite

116
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,648
Little pod one we're calling it it is ready to Launch

117
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
But the new space race has reached a bottom

118
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,280
There are not enough rockets for everyone to get quickly into orb

119
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
So today on the show

120
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
We show you how the rocket makers

121
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Trying to catch up

122
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
The problem is

123
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:27,519
When you're shopping for a tube of metal that spews out Flames at 5000 degrees

124
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,335
The truck doesn't always go as planned

125
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951

For all its hotness

134
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
A rocket is just

135
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
A fancy Taxi

136
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
Picks up a little hunk of metal

137
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
Like a planetary satellite here on Earth

138
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
And it lets it off

139
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,767
Finna particular place

140
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
Now that place is 300 miles above the Earth

141
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
Yes and so doesn't just

142
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
Fall right back down

143
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
The rocket has to give the satellite some momentum

144
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,823
17000 miles an hour worth of momentum to be exact

145
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
That keeps the satellite in orbit rotating the Earth

146
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,967
The Rockets take one big satellite size of a refrigerator

147
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
Others are filled with satellites

148
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
The size of Rubik's

149
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
Or combination of both

150
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:49,183
And the way it works design-wise is that most of a rocket is engine and fuel

151
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,767
And a very tippy-top is the payload the satellites

152
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,815
I want a rocket gets to space

153
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
It's the right place

154
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,887
The nose opens like a flower

155
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
And a little satellite Papa

156
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
In that sense all Rockets are essentially the same

157
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,847
The competition is to see who can do that faster cheaper and

158
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,431
More reliably fast shipping on time that the rocket motto that's the dream

159
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
Our first test drive

160
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
Was with New Zealand

161
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Rocket lab

162
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
A cute little Sports

163
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:22,207
I visit them back in April their factories right next to the Auckland Airport in one of those generic-looking Office Park

164
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Except

165
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
What are the building

166
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
Has a slick

167
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,607
Good night black carbon fiber rocket

168
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
Sitting right on the side

169
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,287
I think that's where our satellites going to go

170
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,639
Inside I met by the CEO of Rocket lab

171
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Peter Beck

172
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
The first thing I want to ask is

173
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
Why exactly did I have to come

174
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
This far to see rocket

175
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:52,415
We are looking at a map of the world here

176
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:57,023
And there you are New Zealand down in the lower right-hand corner

177
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
Basically a half an inch

178
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,143
Neil Young exactly

179
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,775
Just got wild curly hair and this baby face and as he wants me to the factory he says listen

180
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
Ynot New Zealand

181
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,407
No spice spices is kind of you to this

182
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,551
Super romantic place in an elite by switch right now it is but the whole point of Rocket lab is to break down that barrier

183
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
Ultron reinforced everybody that

184
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
Yeah yes it's this farnes excitement and and it was right right wonderful but at the end of the day we're

185
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Company

186
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
We take the Apostle and we deliver it

187
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
End

188
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
End

189
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,959
Rocket lab wants to be like UPS

190
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,543
Type in a New Dress 300 miles above the Earth

191
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Which orbit you want

192
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,895
You know equatorial or bed maybe you want to go around the North

193
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
Will South Pole that way

194
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
Rocket lab will take your satellite there

195
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
No drama

196
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
The Salt Lake business needs a UPS right now

197
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Last year in 2016

198
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,671
85 Rockets going into space

199
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
85 Rockets

200
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
In the entire world

201
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
And if every podcast wants to put up a satellite

202
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,631
There is not enough rocketry to get all of a sudden

203
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:12,287
The goal of Rocket lab is to build a small rocket to specifically cater to all of these new small satellites all these cubes

204
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
That's like ours

205
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
The goal is to send a rocket up every week

206
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
52 a year

207
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,223
Buy rocket standards it is a pretty crazy dream

208
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
In order to do it babe model displays

209
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,599
After one of those Nimble Silicon Valley startups

210
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,183
Complete with inspirational slogans on the wall

211
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
Sup by Peter himself

212
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
Bowie radar

213
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,839
You want to read your own slogan

214
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:42,495
Make everything you do a work of art if it looks like crap and does not work then you have nothing

215
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,823
If it looks fantastic and does not work at least it looks fantastic

216
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
Exactly that's the point right

217
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,735
That is an interesting approach

218
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,783
For a person making

219
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
State-of-the-art machinery

220
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,647
I will say the principal here is to make it work and

221
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,511
And I was I was hoping to get to see a live rocket launch

222
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Before

223
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,327
I committed are programmed to Rocket lab

224
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
But there is a ship

225
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
Rocket lab hasn't actually sent

226
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
A rocket to space yet

227
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,799
Peter shows me this live video monitor that's on the wall

228
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,383
There's a remote cliff on the east coast of New Zealand and there

229
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
On the cement pad

230
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
Is there very first rock

231
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Protest Rock

232
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
In fact

233
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
That's A Neck

234
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
Well at first when it's cold at the tip

235
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
You can name the second one hopefully this one will work

236
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,231
UCF

237
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
Third time's a charm

238
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,143
Pictures of that plan for to take three tries to get this right

239
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
Already says

240
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,239
There's been big breakthroughs in his quest

241
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
For cheap frequent space travel

242
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Princeton

243
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Peter says

244
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
They will be able to launch faster than anyone else

245
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Because of that remote

246
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,199
New Zealand launch pad

247
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,247
A company in the United States could not launch

248
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
52 times a year because

249
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
There too many people

250
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
And boats and planes flying over

251
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
If we wanted to lunch once awake

252
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,511
I was going to pull up United Airlines every week and tell them that we going to Delight Watsonville and I

253
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,071
Turn the ceiling they already have a permit to Launch

254
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
Every few days

255
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,655
They want to hear a lot fewer flights in and out of

256
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,983
Yeah these customers yelling there are fewer of everything

257
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Exception

258
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
Except sheep

259
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,687
Are the other Innovative thing that rocket lab is doing used to manufacture the Rockets

260
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:32,063
Lighter and cheaper than their competitors so the tube of the rocket is made out of

261
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Carbon fiber

262
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
The Petersons

263
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
You can even lift it

264
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,487
With one arm I'm going to lift stage 2 of this rocket

265
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,095
Well that is heavier little heavier than I thought but I'm lifting it I'm doing it

266
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
Bethel Music

267
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
Do the picks up

268
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,983
This gorgeous curved piece of metal looks like a bell

269
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
This is part of the rocket engine

270
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
And it was made with a 3D printer

271
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
Wait how long did that take

272
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,759
I know I know for years I've been hearing that the future

273
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
3D printing and then

274
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
Someone shows you like a trinket or a little

275
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
Toy they took him three days to make

276
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
And you say

277
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
This

278
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
This is part of a metal rocket in

279
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Not made of plastic

280
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
Computer says with six printers

281
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,631
They can make a rocket engine every 24 hours

282
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,447
And you can see the tiny little holes in the side there

283
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,567
Those old run through here as far around here and run through here and Link back out

284
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
To that section are

285
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,199
Totally get rocket go off the fire that comes out the bottom that's coming out of here

286
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,527
Wow so rocket lab has figured out the fastest

287
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,415
Energy Park they are planning on each rocket costing around $5000000 what yeah I know

288
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,695
I know that sounds expensive

289
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
The rocket business that is cheap

290
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Now

291
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
About the reliability

292
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
That's the real question

293
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
Because the test rocket

294
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
Is still sitting there on the video screen

295
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
Peter says it could launch any day

296
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,359
But basically they're going to go when they're ready when the conditions are right

297
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
And so there I was a New Zealand

298
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,223
Rocket just sitting there on the cliff

299
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
Not launching

300
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:11,647
So I did make Peter promise you will

301
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
Actually like

302
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,279
Photos and record nginx

303
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,375
So I go home back to New York and a month later in May

304
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,935
We get the phone call to test rocket is

305
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Ago

306
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,799
And they not only videotape that they made a whole promotional video of the Tesla

307
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
1

308
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:38,015
April his New Zealand cool when the rocket went off you can

309
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:44,415
See Peter back going for jumping up and down waving his hand

310
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,255
I was feeling pretty high

311
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
On rocket

312
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:55,423
Okay so you are team Corvette we are officially planet is officially going to take a sports car to space

313
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
Yeah it's a tight soda mist

314
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
A crucial fact

315
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
What I was watching this video

316
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,871
And I learned about what I was talking about the launch with Mike staff

317
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,711
He's the launch director at the company that's letting us adopt a satellite planet

318
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
He's our sort of co-parenting this

319
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
Mike said

320
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,111
Yes it was amazing for a first test

321
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
But

322
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
The rocket did not quite

323
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
Reach orbit

324
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
It made it most of the way

325
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
So they are cheap

326
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,887
Most of the way that doesn't sound good

327
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
So

328
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Building a rocket is not such a

329
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
A simple thing

330
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
And

331
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,639
You know that's why you have a test flight program so you can kind of work out the Kinks

332
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
Before you go into full commercial operation so

333
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
If your

334
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Satellite

335
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:47,391
Doesn't make it to orbit in this one we would probably be able to get you on another ride that would be a bit more

336
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Reliable

337
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,231
Until we start again a little bit

338
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
Nervous

339
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Nothing silly about

340
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,863
Losing our satellite but about deadline

341
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
How long would it

342
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
Take rocket lab to do another test

343
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
And of course

344
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,751
We don't have to choose

345
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
Rocket lab I mean s build a rocket broker would say

346
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
There's always another rocket

347
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
Which planet does have deals with other Rock

348
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
And during the summer

349
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:16,319
We had to sort of real serious conversation with Planet about the options

350
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,159
They said luck we're not sure when rocket lab will be ready

351
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,767
There is another company with a planned launch that we can jump on

352
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,583
Without a beautiful sunny California

353
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,887
It is orbital ATK

354
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
Orbital ATK was the Volvo

355
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
The Volvo

356
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Ab Rocket

357
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
Yes I know it is not the sports car

358
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,431
They can't watch every week the Rockets are way more expensive than the New Zealand model there like 40 million dollars

359
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Fox

360
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
They have that

361
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,063
Third thing I was talking about it they are reliable super reliable

362
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,159
When astronauts on the International Space Station are running low on food

363
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:58,303
Who sent it to him orbitalatk the Volvo sensus supplies of orbital ATK

364
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
It's okay Robert

365
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,655
We have a choice here there is the

366
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
Experimental hotness

367
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
A rocket lab

368
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Very hot

369
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,287
3D printer rocket

370
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
Or there's the stable to

371
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Dependable

372
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
Madewell boxy

373
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Orbital ATK

374
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
PK rocket

375
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
So

376
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
What are we going to do

377
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
With one satellites

378
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
Two options

379
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
What do we do

380
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Sports car of Volvo

381
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,743
I am a father as you know so I do actually face this question

382
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
All the time

383
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
Am I going to do

384
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
The safe

385
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Responsible thing

386
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,215
The Planet Money satellite that has been entrusted

387
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Tumi

388
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,823
The people little pod one of America

389
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Or

390
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,383
Am I going to do

391
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
The fun

392
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,223
Risky life-changing

393
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Amazing thing

394
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
I'm in a large empty field

395
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
Scrub brush everywhere

396
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,743
And just over the hill is

397
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Iraq

398
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,327
I made the decision the Planet Money rocket

399
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,887
Such a beautiful spot

400
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
In the end it was an easy choice

401
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
I have deadlines to keep

402
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,263
Miles to go before I sleep

403
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
The Volvo

404
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:17,407
You picked the Volvo of course I picked the Volvo I want to go to space I got that.

405
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,503
And the communications director from orbital ATK Jennifer Bowman

406
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
She says

407
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
Hey buddy

408
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Did the right

409
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
We're reliable

410
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
We're affordable

411
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
And

412
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
We are

413
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,767
Really designing new vehicles all the time too

414
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
Meet the needs of our customers okay it does have a pretty cool day

415
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
The orbital ATK

416
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
Minotaur C

417
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
The Minotaur

418
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031
After we decided to go with orbital ATK

419
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
We waiting for them to tell us a date

420
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
And then

421
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,199
We got a call end of October Vandenberg Air Force Base

422
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
On the Pacific coast just north of Santa Barbara

423
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
The Planet Money satellite

424
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Part 1

425
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
Got ship they're ahead of us

426
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
To be loaded up

427
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,927
And when we finally see

428
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
The Rock

429
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Iraq

430
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
The Planet Money rocket

431
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
It is a beast

432
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,375
Holy moly

433
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
Into how tall is this thing

434
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
It is 103 ft tall

435
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
What is it like 10 stories

436
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,639
So our satellite is on the top of that thing 10 stories up

437
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,711
It is almost twice as tall as the rocket lab rocket

438
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,783
It's built with some components from military missiles which

439
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
Orbital ATK also build

440
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
And so

441
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
It is a more

442
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,207
Powerful rocket it can take much larger satellites than ours into orbit

443
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
But everyone is getting into the small saddle

444
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,351
An orbital has made a deal with planet or satellite partners

445
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
To take a bunch of smaller satellites as the

446
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Primary payroll

447
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
Looking at I still I still cannot believe it

448
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,543
Are satellite the one we've been working on pod1

449
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,615
With our logo on it with a waveform

450
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
Of our voices

451
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
Extra on the side

452
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
It is on the top of

453
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,527
This rocket is 24 hours away

454
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,063
From space

455
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,903
Or a blaze of glory a beautiful blaze of glory

456
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
So can we watch the rocket

457
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,047
Well in theory you could but

458
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
It's

459
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,143
They're really busy right now and it's hazard

460
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,471
Operations and there's crowd-control and soap

461
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
No

462
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:19,519
No

463
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Top of the stack

464
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Dangerous

465
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
The rocket uses solid

466
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
Fuel which by the way I learn

467
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,247
Is the consistency of a pencil eraser

468
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
Probably stick your thumb into it

469
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,623
If you wanted to and apparently this rocket acts like a giant

470
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
Firecracker

471
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:40,511
And it burns from the inside out and Flames shoot out the bottom

472
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
And everyone says

473
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,351
This design means that it will almost certainly

474
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Not

475
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Explode

476
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
But when I asked

477
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
What can go wrong

478
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
Tomorrow during the launch

479
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
There is this long pause

480
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,591
And it took me a while to work it out but apparently

481
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,151
A previous version of this kind of rocket

482
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,687
Had a bit of bad luck

483
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,991
There was a launch where the

484
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Fairing

485
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Did not

486
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:08,415
Separate properly and soap

487
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
The part on Top

488
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
The goes around

489
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
Also Catalyst Payson

490
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,863
And they were all trapped inside a little too heavy so it couldn't because it didn't come off

491
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
So it didn't get to the proper

492
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Orbitz

493
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,543
So for this type of Rocket this is the first time this is going to space

494
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
This exact Hardware

495
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
It'll be the first time it goes to space

496
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,807
Apparently there is no such thing as a 100% guaranteed

497
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
Rocket launch

498
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:40,159
So we could be in for a white-knuckle ride

499
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
On the Volvo

500
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
Yeah it's a little more dangerous than we thought

501
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Tomorrow

502
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
Launch day

503
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
It's Halloween

504
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,911
Halloween and our entire satellite project is resting inside of an untested rocket

505
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,727
Call The Minotaur the Minotaur half man

506
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
Hypebeast

507
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
Half narrative stunts

508
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
To keep the drama going

509
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,127
And if I remember my mythology correctly

510
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407
The Minotaur

511
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
Did not have a hat

512
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,879
Next time I plant money weed on our silly app

513
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:17,279
Costumes for Halloween it is true I expected NPR we start the countdown and we see if the plan

514
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Planet Money satellite

515
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
Will achieve its destiny

516
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,911
300 miles up in the sky

517
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,983
17000 miles per hour around the Earth

518
