1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,304
You know who you don't meet much anymore

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,328
Alchemy

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,424
Alchemist people who look for ways to turn random stuff into gold

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,984
Rebecca the Middle Ages you met him all the time

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,032
Closing those days Alchemist with

6
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,592
Searching for the Philosopher's Stone

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,640
They thought there was this sort of

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,664
Mystikal

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,224
Compound

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,528
Into valuable metals like gold

11
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,064
John emsley is a chemist

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,088
And science writer

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,648
Alchemist State looked everywhere for this

14
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
Philosopher's stone

15
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,232
And there was one material that

16
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,512
What's golden

17
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
And abundance

18
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,816
Everyone has it

19
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:39,680
Alchemists were always fascinated by the golden stream is it with the golden stream

20
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,496
He is talking about urine

21
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,360
Back in 1669 there was this one Alchemist Hennig brand

22
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,640
And as the

23
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
The Story Goes

24
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
He had

25
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,248
A plan to turn urine into gold but

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
She needed a lot of pee for it

27
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
Sonax

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,112
Surely he borrowed some from his neighbors

29
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,160
Hilton put these bowls out by 10

30
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
Yes

31
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,256
And then he even got the local Convent to pitch in

32
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,840
And one evening he bought a large volume of urine down

33
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
It did not

34
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:13,216
Turn into gold magically but it did turn into something they did not expect

35
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,776
The books of a ball

36
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,616
Wax and suddenly off Candice mysterious compound

37
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
Glows in the dark

38
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,176
Close in the dark

39
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
But that

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
Was not all

41
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,504
Spontaneously flammable

42
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,344
This is seeming a little magical he thinks so he and his friend took this

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Glowing

44
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
Ball of urine

45
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
And they paraded around Europe

46
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
I mean it

47
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,536
Tell everyone what it was but

48
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,072
Created quite a stir

49
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352
In part because

50
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,168
Though he had no clue what it actually was

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,776
I did not stop him from

52
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
Improving your sex life and things like that

53
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,104
Penny didn't know it at the

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Time but

55
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
What he had discovered

56
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Was father

57
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,016
Number 15 on the periodic table

58
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
Symbol is the letter

59
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
P phosphorus

60
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
Or phosphate and its uses

61
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
Before you can pretty much everything

62
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,720
Some nasty things like bombs

63
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,488
Apparently

64
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
It explodes when it hits the air

65
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,352
And the poison sure but also it's nice things to

66
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,728
Flame retardant food additive some Pharmaceuticals M Coca-Cola contains phosphoric acid

67
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
So there's nothing to it sometimes

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
Places well no phosphorus no Velveeta

69
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,600
More importantly no phosphorus no life nothing could live without phosphate because it is part of DNA

70
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,648
It's part of Who We Are

71
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,464
But this thing we would all die without this element

72
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
You can't make it out of anything

73
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
And there's no substitute

74
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,072
It's either phosphorus

75
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Or nothing

76
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
And

77
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,680
Not to scare you but there is a limited Supply

78
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
And we're using a lot of it

79
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
So

80
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
Some people are a little worried

81
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
Since we have a limited amount of

82
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
We know that he would not be careful

83
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
We going to be in real trouble trouble

84
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,504
Put a capital T that rhymes with p and that stands for phosphorus

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904

You've got to follow the money

Jeremy Grantham has the money

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,512
He runs a big hedge fund

104

And he's known for predicting things like the dotcom bust and the tooth

Crisis

106
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
He's also known for his pessimism

107
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
His latest concern

108
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,287
I understand that you like to talk about

109
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,383
I don't I can't say I'd like to talk about phosphorus

110
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,199
One of a long list of other

111
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
Pessimistic topics that I seem to have

112
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Cut myself

113
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Involved with

114
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,391
Phosphate again that's the more usable form of phosphorus

115
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Phosphate is a huge mark

116
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
About 76 billion dollars

117
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,559
Most of it goes into fertilizer

118
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,375
Which is actually a little problematic because

119
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
Farmersville just

120
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,983
Pile it on to their crops because they know that plants can only use

121
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
Small amount of it at a time

122
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
So most of that fertilizer

123
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
80% of it

124
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
Washes right off into rivers and

125
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
The ocean

126
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
What's the phosphorus goes to the ocean

127
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Some like it disappears

128
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
Extremely hard to get out of seawater

129
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
Show all the sponsors going to waste

130
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
If that Jeremy worried

131
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
We're on a finite planet with

132
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
Finite Reserve

133
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
A phosphorus

134
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,607
Amway are mining it and running through the supply

135
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
That should make

136
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
Sahara

137
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
The back of everybody's

138
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
Nike Brussels

139
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:33,823
They're widely ranging estimates for just how close we are to the phosphorus cliff

140
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
Maybe we got 30 years

141
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,663
And we have three hundred years

142
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
It's hard to estimate

143
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
This is Jeremy

144
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
Weather is

145
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,599
42 years 62 years are 82 years doesn't really matter

146
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,159
We have to change our way of growing food

147
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,487
We've known for a while that phosphorus was limited

148
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
But the price was cheap and the problem just seem to

149
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
So distant so people are kind of like me

150
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
I'll do with that problem later

151
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
Then

152
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
2008

153
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
Happen the financial

154
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
Crisis and along with many commodities

155
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
Phosphate prices Spike

156
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Which because

157
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
The fertilizer made food prices Skyrim

158
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,247
Now everybody's talking about phosphorus

159
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,647
What's the developing World in 2008

160
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:25,791
And the price of phosphate Rock Spot by 800%

161
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
I would argue

162
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
But that was

163
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
A shot across the bow

164
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
That was the first warning

165
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
The planet Earth

166
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
That we are beginning to run out

167
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
And of course if

168
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,431
You didn't take that warning you could read the US Geological Survey paper

169
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
That came out the next year predicting Peak

170
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
Phosphorus was just

171
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
24 years away

172
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,879
Meaning we would hit maximum production in 2033

173
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
And after that

174
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Good luck

175
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,999
The estimate was revised and the price dropped

176
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
But people were paying at

177
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Pension now

178
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
And all eyes

179
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
We're on

180
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Morocco

181
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Morocco

182
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,007
Has about 75% of the Wolves high grade

183
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,055
Easy together

184
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Phosphate

185
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
And that's a pretty

186
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199
Overwhelming concentration that makes

187
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
The whole of OPEC

188
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Look like ficus

189
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Hikers

190
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
Small fry

191
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:25,695
I just got to the controls most of our phosphate everybody wants to know what what the Moroccans are doing

192
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
And

193
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
It it turns out that they don't want to tell you a lot

194
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,607
This is Brandon Burrell he's a freelance journalist

195
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
And he did a story for business week

196
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
About phosphorus

197
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Couple years ago

198
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
And everybody I talked to in the industry

199
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,847
Sort of feels like you know their there they're trying to use this

200
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Secrecy to their advantage

201
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
That that way they can dictate the price

202
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,527
The Morocco's basically playing poker with their father

203
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Express

204
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,855
And the rest of us just have to make our best bet

205
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
That's exactly right

206
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
A little geography

207
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
The phosphorus is valuable cast

208
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
A phosphorus

209
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
Is split between Morocco

210
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
And Western Sahara

211
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,679
Which is an area that Morocco says belongs to them

212
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Locals

213
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Yuan very few other countries

214
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
The fight is gone unsettled for more than 25 years

215
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,663
Brendan was able to sneak into the mines in Morocco and

216
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
Look around some

217
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,575
As soon as he landed in Western Sahara get out of the plane and immediately at the airport work sort of

218
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
Swarmed by like

219
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,671
Three or four security officers

220
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
Who followed him the entire time

221
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,047
The only thing that he could see was this this one thing

222
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Often the disc

223
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,167
There is literally a conveyor belt in the middle of the desert

224
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,263
It looks like a mirage in the in the desert

225
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
It's just this

226
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,871
Strange line that you can see flashing across the rising and

227
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:51,711
A few points you come closer and you can see is it you know it looks like

228
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
You know like a

229
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,575
Supermarket checkout conveyor belt but it's gigantic

230
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,647
A conveyor belt carries phosphate from the mines in the desert

231
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,695
To the ocean to ships for transport

232
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,999
It's 61 miles long

233
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Tennessee from space

234
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
Probably be seen from our satellite

235
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
It's amazing

236
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
Who put a link on the website

237
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
And the future of the world's food

238
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,727
Supply rides in part on that conveyor belt

239
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
The Americans won't say how much of

240
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,591
The phosphate is in the western Sahara

241
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Conveyor belt

242
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
Purses in Morocco

243
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,735
What date did tell Brendan was lose money on that mine

244
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
You know we

245
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,575
It's only a few percent of our total production

246
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
Do you believe them

247
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
No

248
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,327
Pizza

249
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Way too much security light

250
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,191
Military grade including checkpoints and landmines

251
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,519
To believe that what they're guarding isn't incredibly valuable

252
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
Whatever the price tag is

253
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
Boils down to

254
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
The king of Morocco

255
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
Controls most

256
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
Of the world's phosphate

257
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
It's kind of amazing that that

258
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:01,599
Our future food food food supply depends so much on what happens in this

259
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,391
One country

260
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,207
If only there were some other supply of phosphate

261
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Other than

262
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
The ocean works too hard to get in

263
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Morocco who knows what

264
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
The future there is

265
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
Some other little

266
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
Fountain of phosphor

267
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
4S

268
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
There is someone who has a solution

269
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
This

270
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Kim Nix

271
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
From Vermont

272
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
We're all our own now little fertilizer products

273
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Factories

274
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,711
Probably not going to put that on my Tinder profile anytime soon

275
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
But technically Kim is right

276
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,415
Invest your listeners is where we will bring you

277
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
A little drop

After the break

279
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,591

Hennig brand

288
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,559
The man who collected his neighbors urine boiled it up and discovered phosphorus

289
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
Weirdly he's not the last person to do that

290
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
I heard about someone who is doing this

291
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
Today in Brattleboro Vermont

292
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,311
Remember Kim who we just heard from you had actual like

293
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,895
Tanks of urine in your front yard yeah big ones

294
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
Yeah big ones for a long time

295
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,991
To explain how those

296
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,575
Pink's of urine got into her front yard we should go back to Kim's child

297
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
She has long been intrigued by Sanitation

298
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,511
She said she would visit her aunt in New York and when I was little and I saw those skyscrapers

299
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,095
The very first thing I thought about always was like how do they flush the toilet

300
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,191
Kim actually did her college thesis about toilets that compost waste

301
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,079
And in 2012 she in a man named eight Noah Hayes who made composting toilets

302
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
Founding a research institute

303
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
The rich Earth Institute

304
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,711
That seems like it's kind of a play on

305
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
Yeah they actually originally wanted to call it the poop stool

306
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
The koopsta 2.11

307
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
It is funny but it is not quite a

308
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,767
Right away he knew that the first project was going to be a urine project that we wanted to start with urine

309
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
The urine is really where it's at

310
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
That is a verb

311
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
He and several others told me

312
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
Poop is

313
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
Problem Child

314
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
The toilet

315
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
Transported

316
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
Pathogens

317
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:32,383
But you're in on the other hand you know urine is actually fairly sterile

318
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
It's when it gets combined

319
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,015
With poop that it becomes more dangerous

320
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,343
This is Rebecca writer of former board member of The Institute

321
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
Keep talking

322
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,999
Saying bad things about poo today I've heard a lot of people say bad things about purchasing

323
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
So it sits separate

324
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,863
They're better than together

325
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
It outside

326
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,983
Like a couple you always love but they hated being with each other

327
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
So well you're happy that they're not

328
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,711
And I guess that's the key part as Hennig brand stumbled on

329
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
1669

330
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
Urine is not

331
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Just wait

332
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,879
It is sort of gold because it is filled

333
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
With lots of valuable nutrients

334
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Verses of the story is the

335
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
The phosphorus

336
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,327
We get phosphorus from phosphate rocks and those are external

337
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Soil which

338
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Plants with

339
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Us

340
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,215
The phosphorus that we eat goes straight

341
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Threw us right into our urine

342
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
And even Kim's idea is that if we can

343
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
Recycle that you're in instead of flushing it

344
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
We have

345
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Sustainably

346
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Fertilizer

347
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Forever

348
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:46,623
It's an idea some bigger companies are experimenting with working directly with sewage plants in big cities like London and

349
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
Chicago

350
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
But there in Vermont

351
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
They're taking a more

352
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Hands-On

353
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
So weak

354
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071
Created the urine Brigade

355
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
And literally that was our committee

356
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
They're like six of us we sat on my back porch

357
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,775
Who said how are we going to get this urine from people what are we going to do

358
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
Our biggest fear was definitely that

359
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
That we would become like

360
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Certified

361
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
Hideous laughingstock

362
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,479
Rebecca reuter was in the urine Brigade

363
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,855
Soap she offered to try to find some people with kind hearts and full bladders

364
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
And she did find them at a church and this a Community Chorus which means it's open to whoever wants to come and see

365
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,839
Every practice there was a break where people could announce thing

366
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,167
An old library fundraising in school bake

367
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Sales

368
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
Other community events

369
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
So I practice one night

370
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Rebecca

371
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
The notorious as usual

372
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Waited nervously for the break

373
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,271
And then she stood up and she said I would like to

374
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
Ask you to think about

375
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
A new a completely new thing

376
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
And this is

377
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
Collecting your urine

378
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
End

379
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
Bringing your urine

380
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
You know in a little jar or a big jar

381
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
To Kim's house

382
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
And

383
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:05,471
We really need as much urine as possible in order to test our hypothesis

384
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
End

385
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,335
Nobody like jumped up and down out of their chair and raise their hands

386
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,663
But people came to me one-on-one afterwards

387
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
I don't want to offend anybody but

388
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,783
This is the most Vermont story I've ever heard in my life

389
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
There is more

390
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,903
The Brigade that collected their urine in recycled bottles

391
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
From the granola fat

392
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
3

393
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,487
There's really a granola

394
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Trick if there is

395
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,607
And to get the word out even further the next year they

396
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
Sponsored afloat

397
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
In the annual strolling of the heifers parade

398
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
It's not even going to ask

399
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
Cows marching through town

400
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
By the end of that first summer

401
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,455
You're engaged a pretty good haul

402
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
We had 60 people

403
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
And 600 gallons of urine

404
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,647
So 600 gallons of urine that that sounds like a lot that sound successful

405
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
But to me actually

406
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
Use it straight on the field

407
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,119
Well I went to find out okay so the next place we're going to go now is to the farm

408
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,959
We have two Farms that we work with now

409
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,799
Can I drove to a farm just on the outskirts of town

410
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
Run by this guy

411
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Dean Hamilton

412
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,175
And I guess you call me a retired Dairy Farmer

413
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,039
Does STIHL Farm Heroes hay tell me about the size of the hay Farm

414
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Wild

415
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
She persists 360

416
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:30,975
Give or take a course on the farm but 12 years ago Dean sold all his cows

417
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
2006

418
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
The sorry day that the

419
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
Milk the cows in the morning and

420
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
Austin went it wasn't just nostalgia

421
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
He lost something else that

422
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
Without the cows now in a source of

423
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,359
Fertilizer now all my feels can use

424
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,151
All the nutrients you can get right now

425
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
So Dien signed up to be there test

426
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,015
Westfield he gets their urine after they process it there

427
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Is it

428
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Orange juice

429
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,647
And then he loads the sanitized urine into a

430
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
Container that he

431
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
Pulls behind a tractor

432
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,535
Literally spreading the neighbors year in

433
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,143
Crosses hey you run a hay farm that is entirely fertilized by human years

434
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
Right now it is yep

435
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Yep

436
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:18,079
What is hay grown with cow manure how does that compare to hate grown with

437
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
Human urine

438
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,943
You don't have to use your imagination to see the difference and see what you can see the difference clearly

439
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,991
Easily can double the

440
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
You know the yield in my head

441
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,087
You can see a color

442
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
You know

443
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
Docker green

444
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
He says there is

445
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,023
One problem and that is it there is not enough urine

446
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
We need to get more people using the bathroom

447
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,167
Yep yep simple as that I can find a home for the urine if I have a

448
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,983
Ambika Supply even can they work

449
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
Twitter USDA

450
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
Science Foundation bunch of others

451
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,359
Did you test there are more scientific

452
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,455
But they show pretty much the same results as Dean can see with his own eyes

453
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
So

454
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,319
Another with Kim is right we are pretty good little fertilizer fact

455
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,927
Urine is just a small fraction of how phosphorus gets wasted

456
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
Remember there's Farm runoff and Wastewater

457
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,559
So companies are working on how to capture that

458
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Phosphorus

459
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
What what's the hope and dream if you get everything you want

460
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
So

461
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,799
Araxi wrote out a statement I think it's still in my bathroom

462
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,407
And I put it up on the wall and I said you know my vision is it in within my lifetime

463
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
I would like to see half

464
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
People in the world

465
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
Recycling the nutrients

466
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
From their bodies

467
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
So yes I'm a I'm a real

468
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,111
Dreamer end

469
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
What what are the odds that your dream comes true

470
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,535
What are the odds of that it really depends on us

471
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,583
Seriously though what what are the odds of a

472
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
Well there are estimates that

473
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:50,239
Every single one of us pees about $125 a year

474
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,823
Is enough to grow 325 lb of weeks

475
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
I'm going to sell my urine at the Green Market

476
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,455
Locally sourced right sample

477
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
Not organic

478
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
Organic

479
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:17,119
You know the scheme so crazy it just might work
