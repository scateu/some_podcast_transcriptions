00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,096
Did come from Michigan Economic Development

6
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,496
By searching Michigan pure opportunity

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,032
Everybody

8
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,056
Just a quick note

9
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,384
The show is a rerun it originally aired in 2016

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,784
Amy cop lives in Indiana and owns a white 2004 Subaru Impreza

11
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,064
It is not

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
A really nice

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,136
It's really banging.

14
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,440
It's almost always dirty

15
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,792
Even my three-year-old daughter sometimes seems to

16
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:39,680
I prefer to pretend that the other car is at her preschool are her car

17
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,472
But Amy really loves

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,032
This car this is the car that she drove

19
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,336
Through a snowstorm in Indianapolis

20
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,384
To bring her newborn daughter home from the house

21
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,992
I just kept looking in the rearview mirror my wife was sitting back there

22
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,272
Found with the baby

23
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:58,880
It was a really happy scene in the backseat but yeah I was just

24
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,160
The terror

25
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,720
The funny thing about this not so nice but

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,304
Beloved car is that Amy ended up kind of a bidding war over it

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,120
About five years ago her friend Erica was selling the soup

28
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Amy and her wife

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,192
Wanted it and so did another

30
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
A guy in a woman

31
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,824
And anything said that couple was offering about $100 more

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
But Amy's friend tok

33
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,408
She sold the Subaru to Amy

34
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456
She just had one requirement

35
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
You cannot

36
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,808
Pob Human Rights Campaign sticker off the back window

37
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,648
And if you don't understand exactly what I'm saying let me let Amy explained

38
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
She sold it to us

39
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
Go to another lesbian

40
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,376
Erica wanted for Subaru to go to another lesbian couple

41
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,216
Part of the reason he's laughing here is that this has become kind of a stereotype

42
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
Type that lesbian women love

43
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,800
The car even has a nickname

44
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,872
Erica always call it the lesburu

45
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
This is not an axe

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,712
Subaru spent more than a decade

47
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,272
Carefully targeting lesbian consumers

48
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,184
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Noel King and I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,208
Today on the show

50
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Why Subaru started targeting a group of

51
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,328
Consumers that just about every other company with

52
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,888
Ignoring and how that may have helped

53
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,448
Save the company

54
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896

You put the time

63
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
I'm into making them your own

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
So now it's time to protect them

65
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232

But they'll be there

69
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
You when you need them

Neighborhoods across that

72
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
There could be

73
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
Just around the corner

74
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
Morehead State Farm.

75
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
1 800 State Farm

76
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
State Farm

Here to help life

78
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Go right

79
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,504
In the early 90s Uber was in trouble

80
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
Feel they've been slumping for about 7 years

81
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
Super with competing against Giants

82
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,672
Play Toyota and Nissan and it was losing

83
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,000
Tim Bennett work in sales distribution for Subaru back then

84
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
And him the problem was pretty clear

85
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,096
Subaru was having an identity

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,912
These were not sexy cars

87
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
Tim says they were

88
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,264
Boxy reliable wagons with a certain kind of feel

89
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,360
It's granola let's 10000 Maniacs it's crunchy gets hippie

90
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
It said

91
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
Professor in a tweed jacket

92
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,736
Pokemon go does not want a 10000 maniacs

93
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,784
They are a great Banner creepy

94
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
But but

95
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
Companies want to sell to mass Market

96
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,648
And not just

97
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
Hippies and professor

98
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,584
Subaru hired a cool Ad Agency the ones that had come up with the just do it slogan for Nike

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,144
But even they could not make Subarus

100
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
The ad campaign went nowhere

101
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
Morale at Subaru was

102
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Raises

103
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
And bonuses went out the window

104
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
Intensive sales people started making all these

105
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
Really dark jokes

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
About how is things

107
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,992
Got any worse they were just going to have to start sending new Subarus Direct

108
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
The scrap yard

109
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
If not on a winning team you're on a losing team

110
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,344
Nobody wants to be an illusion

111
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
And if I would have felt like it

112
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
But the company realize

113
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
One type of Subaru was actually selling pretty well

114
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
These are cars with all-wheel drive

115
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
The kind of cars that are popular in places with bad weather

116
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,263
Super said alright let's start there with the bright spot let's meet the people who are buying these cars

117
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
The Ransom focus groups

118
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
And they identified four categories of

119
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
People who are buying super

120
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,503
The first category they called the rugged individualist basically the outdoorsy types

121
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,063
So those are the people kayakers mountain biker scares

122
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
Denver technical professionals

123
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
Technical professionals

124
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
Engineers

125
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
Got

126
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
I'm educators

127
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Teachers

128
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
Teachers

129
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,351
Healthcare professionals

130
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
Do you have to get to the ER all kinds of weather data.

131
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
So it's a random assortment of

132
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Professions

133
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
But within those groups

134
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
There was a Common Thread

135
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Women

136
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,383
A lot of Subaru owners were women

137
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
In a lot of cases

138
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
They were women who identified themselves as

139
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Head of house

140
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
Tim Mahoney was running marketing for Subaru at the time

141
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
And one day he was watching

142
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
A focus group

143
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
San Francisco behind a two-way mirror

144
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
One of the guys

145
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Who

146
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,071
Actually work for our research company who happened actually be gay

147
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
He says yeah all my friends

148
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
Turn on supers are lesbians

149
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,031
And it was like one of those moments where everything came into focus and it's like a wow

150
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,615
Tim Mahoney realize he may have just discovered a fifth

151
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
Group who loves Subaru

152
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Lesbian

153
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,735
So that's who has to figure out two things

154
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Number one

155
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
Is this true or is

156
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Anecdotal

157
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,391
Is it actually a significant consumer group for

158
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
For Subaru

159
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
And then if it was how are they going to Market

160
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
Kathy's Kars to lesbian

161
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,559
Super got in touch with Mariah now

162
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
The tiny Ad Agency based in Manhattan

163
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,703
With specialized in marketing to Gay and Lesbian consumer

164
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
John Nash was the creative director at the time

165
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
What was the first campaign you worked on

166
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Is Dalaman

167
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
Dial a match 1 800

168
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,687
Mattress there on Queen

169
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,271
Names John and his business partner date Mariah and we're both openly gay

170
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:19,903
And they would go to these big companies and they would pitch them they would say look gay and lesbian consumers are

171
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
A big deal they have

172
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Money and

173
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
We know how to talk to her

174
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Hire us to

175
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
To design you ask for

176
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
So with dial Mattress

177
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,935
You did these Billboards and beautiful photography of a guy like like

178
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:38,335
It was all three already a guy laying on his stomach but you could see you know he had to his mother wasn't wearing any clothes but he had to she pulled

179
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Down

180
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,383
Who you sleep with

181
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Yeah here it is

182
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
Who you sleep with his your business how you sleep is ours

183
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Dial a mattress

184
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
Beside it was a tough sell

185
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,343
This was the early 90s it was during the AIDS

186
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Crisis

187
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,439
And a lot of companies would not talk directly to gay and lesbian

188
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,023
Consumers because they were afraid of alienating heterosexual cancer

189
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Is that John says

190
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
A lot of the companies that

191
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,727
Did advertise to gays and lesbians what he calls the sin Industries like booze and cigarettes

192
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,543
And then out of the blue comes as call from soup

193
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,615
Saying hey we think lesbians might be one of our most

194
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
Markets and we need to confirm it

195
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
So John and his colleagues went out to Northampton Mass

196
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,063
Subaru's research said a lot of its cars were being sold their

197
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,927
And they gathered a little group of local Subaru owners together into a room with one of those two-way mirror

198
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
So we get up there where in the

199
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:33,375
There any observation room which always has like M&Ms and crackers is a very dangerous place today specially if you are on

200
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
Any kind of a diet so there's

201
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,751
All that candy and then the women start coming in

202
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
Yeah that's the amazing thing

203
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
Both groups were 100% fee

204
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,895
100% there were no men

205
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,247
John watches the women from the other side of the mirror while a researcher ask some

206
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
What do you use your car for

207
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,831
I want to move my dog from here to

208
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
I like throwing my stuff in the back and going camp

209
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
There's a tone and a

210
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
There's a tone to how they were answering

211
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,535
That was different than a woman saying

212
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
I like to go to TJ Maxx and get my hair done

213
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Wow

214
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Okay parently

215
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:11,775
Two kinds of women in the world I know I know I know I know and John said as a human being

216
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
He hates

217
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:19,199
This kind of stereotyping but this is sort of what you do you break people up

218
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
Categories

219
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,271
Do you say broadly here's what they're like

220
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
And then you try to sell stuff to him

221
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:28,415
So this is exactly what he's doing he's looking at these women and he says to himself

222
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,975
I think they are part of a specific group

223
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,791
And like these are lesbians are talking about be there less

224
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
Okay not just that

225
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
With these women seem to

226
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
Love their Subaru

227
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,959
So John in the Ad Agency drive down to

228
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,495
Cherry Hill New Jersey which is

229
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
Where Subaru is headquartered

230
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
To pitch the company

231
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
This was not

232
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
A small d

233
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
I think a lot of us forget this

234
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
But the early 90s were not apart

235
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Particularly

236
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
Progressive time right

237
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
This is the era of don't ask don't tell

238
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
In just a couple years Bill Clinton was going to sign the Defense of Marriage Act which would effectively say same-sex Partners cannot

239
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
Be considered spouses

240
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
And even inside Subaru

241
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
Being openly gay was not easy

242
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,191
Tim Bennett the guy you saw Subaru having an identity crisis

243
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,239
He later worked on this campaign

244
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
Tim is gay

245
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,567
Any never came out at Subaru

246
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Because he saw what

247
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Could happen if

248
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
There was a out

249
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,015
Johnny was gay in the Mailroom they were people in the office it didn't want him to deliver mail

250
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
To their deaths because they're afraid they're going to get AIDS

251
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
So this is the environment

252
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
I know a lot of people thinking of the campaign notes if

253
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
That's what happened

254
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
So here comes Mariah and Nash

255
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
Into this conference room with about 20 Subaru bigwig

256
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
John and the team start

257
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
A PowerPoint presentation

258
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
Here is we are

259
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
Here is what we were doing in Northampton

260
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
And then

261
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,775
And then it was time for the bombshell Bass

262
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,383
Basically in and that's it I think that was like 6 or 7 panels into this PowerPoint thing

263
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
You know

264
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
You click the button up Pops this thing you know the

265
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,551
The target consumer in Northampton is a lesbian woman

266
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
John is braced

267
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Spell resistance

268
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
We have to remember his agency

269
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
I have been going to come

270
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
4 years

271
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
Number statistics data sing

272
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,583
Look gay and lesbian consumers are very important you need to start marketing

273
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,119
Look at the numbers

274
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
And companies have been looking at this and saying

275
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
You're very interesting but

276
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
No thanks

277
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
And now here he is pitching to a car

278
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,103
Which is like the definition of mainstream

279
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,175
And he's telling them you got to Market your car still West

280
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
In the middle of the pitch John keeps

281
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Sneaking these glances

282
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
At the president of the company

283
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
Trying to figure out what he said

284
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
He just kind of dogs

285
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,743
Sexy crosses his arms and you know you always learn in business that when people cross their arms

286
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
The closing

287
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Themselves off

288
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:46,143
Tea or something crazy like that likely at that's where you always have to be careful cocktail party don't cross your arm

289
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,983
Other people around the table are also looking at the president of Subaru wondering

290
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Say

291
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,591
But he doesn't do or say anything

292
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Just keep watching the pitch

293
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,503
So they finish the presentation and then I don't need to invent a group to speak to

294
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
It looks like you found a group of people we can already talked

295
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
He said so this looks like a good

296
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
He didn't forget

297
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,951
Not only did he not freak out he hired them

298
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
I remember

299
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
This is a car come

300
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
This is what every Ad Agency

301
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Wingstop

302
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
And now this tiny little ad firm has been hired to

303
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,191
To create ads for gay and lesbian

304
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Consumers

305
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
4 super

306
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,335
Now of course they had to get down to designing the actual ads

307
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,895
Johnson has this proved to be a little bit true

308
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
Remember they were breaking new ground

309
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
And so John had to find ads.

310
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,343
It would fit the image that Subaru had been cultivating for years and years

311
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,647
And with this new group of consumers

312
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Find a Target

313
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
That's right in fact John showed me the first

314
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,279
Print ad that he did in 1995

315
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
Until what it is is there's a

316
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
The Subaru up at the top

317
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
Bright and there's

318
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
Two women down at the bottom and the headline is

319
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
It loves camping

320
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
Dogs and long-term commitment

321
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
Too bad it's only a car

322
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,431
Good right it's good good and then down at the bottom there's a

323
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,527
Two women well when they had first went to the executives with two women

324
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Together

325
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
The executive see this and they tell John

326
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,671
Listen listen separate them please put some copy in

327
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
Between them like an opposite corners of the

328
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,511
Looking at each other

329
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
Looking looking over the tech

330
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
What can I text a teacher

331
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
From this Johnson's the kind of settled into a

332
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,799
What they would use references that were obvious to Gay and Lesbian consumers

333
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
But not really to anybody else

334
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
And at the time there was

335
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,687
Xena Warrior Princess

336
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
Was the show that was airing like on

337
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
The WB Network or something and the lesbians

338
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Love

339
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
Lucy Lawless

340
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
And everybody loves Ino

341
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,487
So one of the license place is going to be Xena lover Xena lvr

342
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
One of them was ptownie

343
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
P dash

344
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
County

345
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
For Brownstown another one was a camp out

346
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
It was so subtle

347
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,799
The message was there but you would have to look at the license plate on the car

348
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
In the picture in the printer

349
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Add together

350
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,687
Jonathan San Francisco when the ad campaign launched she was at 8

351
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,271
A bus stop and a bus pulled up to the stop with his add on it

352
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,623
Immediately looks everybody standing there a bunch of old ladies look at the cars done to a thing

353
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
Two gay guys and believe me I knew they were gay gaydar

354
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Finely tuned

355
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,047
They both look at each other and just kind of smile like they got it

356
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Yeah they got it

357
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,143
In about 2 years after this campaign started

358
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,191
Subaru sales started growing

359
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
The niche marketing was work

360
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Remember those group

361
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,847
What's the Subaru had identified the outdoorsy types of nurses and engineers

362
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
Subaru head marketing to all of them

363
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
And it's sales we're going up

364
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
And then

365
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
In 2000 Subaru made

366
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,319
Bold move aimed right at lesbian consumers

367
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
Martina Navratilova

368
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
Subaru hired the retired tennis

369
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Star who is

370
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,767
One of the most high-profile lesbians in the world at that

371
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
To do this big Act

372
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:01,471
How do I know about the performance control

373
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,543
Who do I know about grip

374
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Everything

375
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
She knows everything.

376
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,991
Pam derderian was responsible for this campaign

377
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
She runs a marketing firm called 15 minutes

378
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,159
Ink and she introduced Martina Navratilova to the people at Subaru in the 90

379
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,439
And she says

380
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,791
This was the moment when Subarus Niche marketing campaign beak

381
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Came not-so-nice

382
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
She was on mainstream television commercials

383
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Promoting the car

384
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
She was in

385
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Print ads

386
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
It's promoting the cars

387
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
She was an outdoor

388
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
Billboard advertising

389
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
Promoting the cars

390
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
She was in Maine

391
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
Dream

392
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Advertise

393
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
Not that there wasn't some pushback

394
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,551
Superman always faced resistance from some of its dealers who

395
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Had problems with

396
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
Print ads

397
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,415
But when I started to hit TV the campaign got a lot

398
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
More attention

399
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
This wasn't just

400
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
Xena Angeles

401
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
These were really high-profile ads

402
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
John Nash said they were angry letters

403
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,191
Boycott is anxiety-inducing only because you don't want to lose one of your favor

404
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Your clients

405
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Over something that's

406
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Completely out of you

407
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Air control

408
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,847
If the business marched away was going to be because someone

409
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:16,735
Wrote a letter in crayon saying you know how dare you sell cars to these dirty gay people

410
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
Subaru didn't March

411
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
They kept up the campaign

412
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,903
And a year after they hired Martina Navratilova they had their best

413
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Sales year 2

414
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
Eminem 2004 there was this big opportunity for

415
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
Product placement

416
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,607
There was a show on Showtime called The L Word

417
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:38,751
And Pam derderian helped create a storyline on the L word where lesbian tennis player

418
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
Got an endorsement deal with Subaru

419
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Subaru

420
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,807
Yeah so ask her some kind of charity event to support the Arts

421
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
How hot is that

422
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Pam derderian says

423
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
All of this

424
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
Was a really big deal

425
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
All of this was a watershed

426
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839
I kept using the term Niche marketing

427
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
And she kept shutting me down and saying

428
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
Subaru

429
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Went so far beyond nice

430
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
We're more comfortable

431
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,615
Whatever think that that an ABC program Modern Family two week

432
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,943
Weeks ago would have nine or eight year old transgender

433
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
Character on this is not niche

434
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Any longer

435
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
This is just being

436
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,111
I'm proud and owning who you

437
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,415
You are and living in a diverse

438
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
Inclusive

439
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,463
Society

440
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
By about 2006

441
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,839
Subaru had grown into a very steady

442
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Success

443
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,655
It wasn't Toyota wasn't Ford

444
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
But it's numbers were going up

445
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
And when the recession hit

446
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Super Wings

447
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031
The only car company in the US

448
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
Not to lose mark

449
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,151
But in spite of the success Subaru seems to have kind of

450
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Change direction

451
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
I mean if you look at their ads now there's

452
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
New Martina Navratilova know Xena

453
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,623
Instead most of the ads feature pedrosexual an outdoorsy

454
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
Couples on their way to a hike

455
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
And things like that

456
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,231
And the moment when our societies because

457
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
Come so much more inclusive

458
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
It's strange

459
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
Why did Subaru back off

460
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
We have that after the break

461
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423

Moritz servicenow.

479
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
I called Subaru and I asked

480
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
The spokesman

481
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:46,239
Any City true we don't directly Target gay and lesbian consumers anymore

Lake mountain biking and kayaking

485
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,175
Panda Darien has a theory about the

486
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
She says since the 90s when the

487
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
Started

488
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
So many more

489
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
People are just

490
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319
Leaving out

491
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,111
And what was Miche

492
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
Is now just much more means

493
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,975
Stream soonish marketing is kind of passe

494
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
Brightwok Niche marketing became a victim of its own

495
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,095
Success and of course that raises

496
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Is the question

497
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,911
Do ad campaigns actually

498
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Influence

499
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Or do they just reflectix

500
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,591
Yeah I kept asking myself that question and the answer is I honestly

501
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Don't know

502
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:28,991
I put that question to Amy the woman from the beginning of the show who owns a Subaru and loves the Subaru

503
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
She said honestly

504
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
She does not know either

505
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
But then she told me this

506
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,903
Amy went to college in small-town can

507
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,951
In a place that was not

508
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Especially friendly

509
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Mitigate people

510
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
She did not have an easy

511
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,095
Anytime and then after school she moved to Washington DC

512
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,679
And one day she's in Dupont Circle and she sees

513
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Superbad

514
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,775
I remember seeing this ad on the bus stop that said

515
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,079
It's not a choice it's a labor board

516
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,687
It made me smile it made her smile because it was talking to her

517
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
It's not a choice it's the way we're born

518
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
She knew exactly what that ad was

519
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:07,135
I was saying and not everyone would have known exactly what that ad was saying

520
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
It was an inside joke

521
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
Any me was finally on the inside

522
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,471
