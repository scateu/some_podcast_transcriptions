1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,792
Everyone I'm Robert Smith

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
Today Show is a classic

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,680
Classic from January 2014 hope you like it

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,240
Are you ready

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,008
I'm ready

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,800
Tell the story of your bat

7
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,848
To my friend Shane and I

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
After college we're living in

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
And there's just one Park

10
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,968
That we walk by

11
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
Every single day

12
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
And

13
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,600
Somehow it came up in conversation where that Park was located

14
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,416
And Shane said it would located on 22nd Street

15
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,208
And I said it was located on 20th

16
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,280
And at the park that we walk by every day I am

17
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
Certain

18
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
That I'm right

19
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:38,656
Shane is going to space he doesn't actually know that many facts

20
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,448
So I'm like

21
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,216
All right

22
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
And then

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,288
Then you took out of map

24
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,080
And I was wrong

25
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,152
I was certain

26
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
Complete

27
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,224
There is something satisfying about it

28
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
How do you say

29
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,064
That's a nice moment where there's something it's

30
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,600
Where you got two sides

31
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,648
That is sad here is what I believe

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,184
And here is way to test

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,952
Whois ripe

34
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
One winner

35
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
And one loser

36
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,328
Best case scenario a bet forces you to think

37
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,120
Carefully about what you believe

38
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
And what you don't

39
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
I know these famous good-natured beds

40
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
In the world of science

41
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,776
Revival Stephen Hawking

42
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
Bet another scientist

43
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
That

44
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
Cygnus X-1

45
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
What cygnus X-1

46
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
Something up in the

47
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,272
The cygnus X-1 was not

48
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,296
A black hole

49
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,832
Parking lots

50
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
It was a black guy

51
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
Richard Feynman physicist

52
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,000
Want to bet that no one could make a motor smaller than basically a grain of sand

53
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Smaller than

54
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
160

55
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,304
4th of an inch

56
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Lost

57
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
But in economics

58
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
That's something to happen

59
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,472
The fact if you act around people really just mentioned

60
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
One story

61
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
1 bit

62
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
There was a big one over the future of humanity

63
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
And unlike those bets in science

64
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
It was not a friendly bet at all

65
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,480
Hello welcome to Planet Money I'm Alex blumberg

66
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:01,088
And I'm David Katz of them today we talked with historian Paul Sabin at Yale who just wrote

67
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
A book about

68
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,416
The book is called the bet

69
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
And the story it tells

70
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,024
Explain why bats like this don't happen more often

71
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728

This is not a bet

81
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
From like the 1800s

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,424
It happened to Alex when you and I were in Middle School

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
It was a bad between

84
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
A biologist and Anaconda

85
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
The biologists name was

86
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Paul Ehrlich

87
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,336
Professor at Stanford

88
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
An expert on butterflies

89
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,944
The book called How to know the butterflies

90
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
But then in 1968 he wrote another book

91
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,112
Just a few weeks to put together in this book animal snap your title

92
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
Scott the population bomb

93
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
And it got them on TV

94
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
Not just any TV show

95
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,120
Here's Johnny

96
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
This of course is The Tonight Show at Professor Paul Ehrlich

97
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,776
Seema Khan Sage is a young guy got short dark hair

98
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
He's wearing a suit that today looks

99
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,896
Awesomely vintage with a very very wide super ornate

100
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,296
And the fact that he's on The Tonight Show at all is kind of amazing because when he sits down with Johnny Carson for the interview

101
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Berlitz message

102
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
Is a bit of a downer

103
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:43,744
3.6 billion people in the world today and reading about 70 million a year and that's too many

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,792
The very delicate life-support systems

105
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
The bite of the things that suppliers

106
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
Oliver who will ultimately with Oliver oxygen

107
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
With all of our waste disposal are now severely threatened

108
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,568
His basic argument was that there were too many people on on Earth and that

109
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
Was going to lead to disaster this is Paul Sabin the historian at Yale who wrote the book about the bet we're describing

110
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,040
Early he says was not on The Tonight Show just one

111
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,392
That Johnny Carson had early back on The Tonight Show again and again and again

112
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
Over 20 times

113
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
Present just love the guy

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,791
And his book called the population bomb has sold over 2 million copies

115
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,095
And his parents is on the show probably

116
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
Drawn more audience response and anyone else would have had on would you like

117
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
He was talking about Doom

118
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,639
He could also be really funny he went on tour like a rockstar giving all these

119
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,735
Paul Sabin dug up this speech recorded in 1970

120
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
Let me just say the quality is not very good

121
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
The first line you're going to hear is

122
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,415
I put a lot of thought into what date mankind started to go down

123
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,463
I put a lot of court

124
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
At what date

125
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
Mankind started to go down to two

126
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,727
Today January 3rd 8000 BC

127
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,847
That was the day one a few enterprising Soul living

128
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,711
Go to be around around quarter gave up a hunting and food Gathering existence

129
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
And began to practice agriculture

130
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,319
Well I think that's that is the

131
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Signature

132
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
Style of Paul Ehrlich

133
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,207
Has a biting wit wild same time

134
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
Telling these

135
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,071
Horrible stories about what was going to happen to humanity until

136
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
Ehrlich's view of the world

137
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
July people just seem

138
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Intuitively right

139
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,775
I mean you can look at a graph of the world population going up year after year

140
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,567
And it showed no signs of stopping

141
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
We were living on a finite planet with

142
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
With limited resources

143
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
Raonic was a biologist

144
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,479
He'd seen this thing happened with Anna

145
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Animals would have

146
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Population booms during

147
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,831
Pleaded the resources

148
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Food Supplies

149
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,415
And the result was often a population crash

150
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
Humanzee argued were not immune to the

151
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Human race was in real trouble

152
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
Saban says he had a lot of support

153
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
There are number of biologists

154
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
And they were

155
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,983
Extrapolating from their studies and his case of butterflies but also have other types of

156
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Creatures

157
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,311
The idea of cycles of population

158
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,639
A gross and then population collapse and that would be a devastating

159
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,199
Extraordinary apocalyptic

160
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
Crashed unless

161
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
We took action now to try to avert that

162
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
All right that are like

163
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,367
He is going to be on one side of

164
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Pig on the other side

165
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
At this point is basically

166
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,303
At home watching her like on TV and getting really really worked up

167
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
He's an economist

168
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
His name is Julian Simon

169
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,167
And Simon had also been worried about popular

170
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
But the more he studied at

171
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
The last word he got

172
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,311
Simon feels that the growth in population is not going to be

173
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
But we are not going to run out

174
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,687
Know when you get the chance to explain himself publicly

175
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
He does it in the way that an economist

176
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,367
Here is Simon on the TV show firing line with William F Buckley and let me just say by way of inter

177
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
Kallax

178
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
Okay here he is explaining why he thinks

179
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
We will not

180
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
But it be

181
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,559
Copper ore

182
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
We are royal

183
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,447
We tend to think of the supply is being fine. We think about running out

184
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,775
But we think instead about our capacities to increase that Supply

185
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
By finding substitutes

186
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,711
The finding better ways to get more of it or by replacing it then we begin the longer to think about the supply Loyola coppers being funny

187
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,735
If you don't have

188
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
Cup of a telephone line that you do have satellites

189
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
Transmit messages you as well off as though you had

190
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,951
I recognize that moved at William F Buckley's making

191
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
Actually explaining what the person just said

192
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
Simon here is basically saying

193
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Ehrlich

194
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:39,263
You and your population doomsayers you don't understand how the economy works we are not like butterflies we're not like any other

195
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Species special

196
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
I will make the special

197
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,127
Is this economic system setup

198
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:50,527
That will keep us from harm if we people want more copper there will be an incentive to find more copper if demand for oil

199
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Growth price will go up

200
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,623
Which will create an incentive for people to find alternative fuels

201
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
But as we said he likes or likes

202
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
In fact later in that Firing Line interview

203
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
He tries for a

204
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
Is that little joke about this

205
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
A kid in class was dozing

206
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
And I woke up with a sudden start

207
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
And he said the following

208
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
He said that the Sun

209
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,359
Is going to burn out in 7 million years

210
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
Thank goodness

211
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
I thought you said them

212
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,247
I'm sorry said the sun is around 7 billion years

213
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
I said thank goodness

214
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
I thought he said 7 million

215
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Is 10

216
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
Highlights the absurdity

217
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
About worrying about

218
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Things

219
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
In such a very long Horizon

220
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
Buckley sound so bored and they seem like coughing in the

221
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
I know Simon never made it

222
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,311
These are the two sides you got taller like the Megastar population biologists

223
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
And Julian Simon

224
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Economist at

225
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
The University of

226
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,735
Let me just say In fairness that both of them enjoyed making very big

227
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Make a be pretty dramatic

228
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,855
Ehrlich started a movement called zero population

229
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,415
He got a vasectomy so he couldn't have any kids

230
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
To set an example

231
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,535
And to try to keep population in check he proposed taxes on

232
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Diapers

233
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
Instead of a tax break

234
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
For people who had kids you suggested

235
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
An extra tax for people who had children

236
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,079
Julien Simon meanwhile enjoyed poking the population wears in the eye

237
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,663
A certain point he took to wearing devil horns on his head while giving talks

238
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
Two things along the lines of

239
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,015
We're not going to run out of energy we have the Sun for crying

240
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
That loud

241
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,111
And he went through a drink in a colleague's face after debate

242
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
Simon felt ignored

243
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
You never got the attention

244
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
And it seems that is why he proposed

245
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
The bet

246
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
Kevin said he will learn to detect

247
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
Proposing back when he was a kid

248
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:46,495
He wrote in his autobiography about his father who would say outrageously wrong things and this is sort of a

249
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
Authoritative fashion

250
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
He would refuse to hear any questions

251
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
And Simon got so frustrated he wrote

252
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,175
Quote there was really nothing I can say except

253
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
Do you want to bet

254
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
That's what he said earlier

255
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,295
Simon rodia an article in

256
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
The journal science

257
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Mets announcer like Ken doll

258
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
People like him and this

259
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
Was the first time I guess they're like really

260
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,303
Noticed I think

261
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,703
And there was a furious reply and then they it's spilled over into another academic Journal where they started arguing

262
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Each other

263
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
And

264
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
And Simon proposed an actual bets

265
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
Put your money where your mouth is

266
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
What was Tesla's idea

267
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
So on one side Paul Ehrlich

268
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
And two of his scientist colleagues

269
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
On the other side

270
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Economist Julia

271
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
They decided to

272
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Money on this

273
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
And here it is

274
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Here's the bet

275
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,207
Here's how they decided to wager over the future of humanity

276
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
They decided to bet on

277
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,839
The price of five Metals copper chromium nickel tin and

278
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,215
Wonky but there's actually a nice logic to it because

279
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
You're the basic idea is

280
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,103
That these metals were essential for all kinds of stuff that we do everyday there are

281
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Going to electronics

282
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
The car is in the building

283
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,991
So if Paul Ehrlich was right more people on the planet would mean

284
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
We would start running out of this stuff

285
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
In which case

286
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
The price of these things

287
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
Should go up

288
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
But if

289
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
Simon was

290
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
At the markets in human Ingenuity would sort things out

291
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
Then the prices would not go

292
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
They would say the same

293
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
Or even go

294
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
The time frame

295
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
For the bat was also kind of amazed

296
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,703
The bet that would not come due for a decade

297
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
The bat was over what the price of these Metals would be

298
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
10 years later

299
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,383
So they made the BET 1980 they wouldn't know who won

300
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Here's how the payout would work

301
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
An easy way to imagine it is

302
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
I think that

303
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
In 1980

304
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
You take a box

305
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,903
Can you put $200 worth of each metal in the Box

306
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
So $200 worth of copper Chromeo Metro

307
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Got 5 medals

308
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
The total value in the Box

309
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Is a thousand bucks

310
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Then you wait 10 years

311
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
1990 you open the box

312
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
And you add up how much medals are worth in

313
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
The loser has to pay the winner the difference

314
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,943
I think if it had been maybe they've been Planet Money they would have actually bought the metals and and held on to them and seeing what what

315
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
What would happen but in their case they

316
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,831
They simply went by the prices

317
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,415
This is a good mixed drink exactly

318
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
I like that his colleagues agree to the vet to shut Simon up for tenure

319
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
But they also thought

320
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Of course they're going to win

321
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
Here it comes just to remind people

322
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
The 1970s there's all these things happen

323
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,007
That made it very easy to think that he collapses

324
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:32,127
Was coming there famines in Africa wars were breaking out as a result of conflict in the Middle East OPEC

325
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
I cut up oil to the United States

326
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
Repent huge line that gas stations stretching around the block actually remember this like the gas shortage of the 70s

327
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
Things got so bad that

328
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
The president

329
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
Richard Nixon

330
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Decided he had to do something

331
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Good evening

332
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
3 weeks ago

333
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,023
I spoke to you

334
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,887
About the national energy crisis Ann Arbor

335
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
To drive more slowly on the highway

336
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,287
Leisurely Sunday drive he said maybe

337
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,591
Stay home I am asking

338
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
The old gasoline filling station

339
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:10,015
Close down their pumps between 9 p.m. Saturday night

340
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,319
And midnight Sunday every weekend

341
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
And this is perhaps the most amazing

342
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
Jimmy looking back

343
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,999
Nixon ask people to cut back on an outdoor ornaments with lights

344
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,303
We are already planning right here

345
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
The White House

346
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
Neuchatel

347
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Touch lighting

348
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
That we would normally have at Christmas

349
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
Literally

350
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
Killed Christmas

351
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Craigslist

352
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
No Christmas lights on the White House lawn

353
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,943
And Oliver to say I remember the seventies it was very easy to get the idea that

354
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
The world was just

355
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,247
Careening toward cats

356
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,319
In fact there's a Newsweek cover story around this time

357
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
The title of which was

358
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
Running out of every day

359
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
So that was the context

360
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
That the kind of narrative in America

361
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:55,839
The best started 1980s and remember it's about the price of metals

362
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Over a deck

363
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
Tibet

364
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
Fitbit

365
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,567
10 years Creep by during which the world population does continue to climb we add 800 million people to the

366
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Men

367
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
1990

368
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Who won the bet

369
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,903

So Simon decisively won the bet the prices went down by

377
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
On average around 50%

378
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
In all the metals

379
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,463
A cryo if you if you bundle them together

380
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,791
And they all go down they all went down

381
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Fairlife

382
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,423
For like right yeah it was it was it was a pretty substantial loss

383
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,983
I'm in terms of the alphabet

384
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,775
What are the reasons prices drop so much

385
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
Was just what time it said

386
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
People invented subs

387
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,895
Set of aluminum people use plastic

388
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Paper Packaging

389
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,479
And where are the query that new Wars and conflict would just

390
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
Continue to escalate making scarcity

391
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
The opposite word app

392
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,135
Jennifer example I wore in Zaire and then be aware there was a lot of copper

393
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Actually ended

394
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
So there's more copper in the world

395
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
The price dropped

396
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,559
Economist have gone back and looked at whether Simon just got lucky in

397
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
Metal prices Google

398
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Up and down a lot

399
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,167
And if you pick other 10 years

400
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Bandera Lake

401
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,751
But Paul Simon Says broadly

402
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
You got to give this one to say

403
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
The catastrophe Ehrlich with predicting

404
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
Just did not happen

405
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
So far we have not been just like butterfly

406
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
We're more complicated

407
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
In the sense that what Simon represent

408
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
Was the idea that

409
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,879
That markets and technology and prices

410
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
Would lead to adjustment of supply and demand in in the economic system I think that's

411
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Clearly

412
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,911
Victory has to go at least so far that you have to go to Simon

413
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
What is the good that came out of

414
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
Bet what what did we learn

415
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:17,919
Well I think that human societies are adaptable and at the markets are powerful forces

416
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
But we also

417
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,879
I'd be much more cautious about same thing we learned out of this bed

418
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,231
Well there's a lot of fighting there is not a lot of listening

419
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
The other problem

420
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
Here is that

421
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,399
A bed about metal prices is really a poor proxy for thinking about the the state of the planet

422
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:44,799
Paul Sabin says he thinks the BET actually poison the water has helped set the stage for a world where environmental debates are framed

423
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Extreme

424
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
One side warning of certain catastrophe

425
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
Do the side saying like

426
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,967
Are you chicken littles be quiet everything's going to be fine

427
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,551
In October of 1990 Julian Simon was going through the mail it is

428
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
And he found a small envelope from California

429
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,183
Inside was a sheet of paper listing metal prices

430
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
And a check

431
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
Impala Relic

432
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,535
For $576 instead

433
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
There was no no

434
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,143
Doing Simon died in 19

435
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
But Paul Ehrlich is still a professor at

436
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Is 81 years old

437
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
And we caught him up

438
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,079
That's how I feel today about that bets

439
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
And time

440
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
It is not softened his

441
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,783
We were sorry that we lost because we knew that

442
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
The deniers

443
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
The people who think that everything is going to be great

444
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:36,255
That we can grow forever and so what would make a out of it so obviously we were disappointed

445
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,399
Political State mistake maybe but again we did shut him up pretty much for 10 years so

446
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
It was not

447
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
Catastrophic it's become

448
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,543
What's technically known and scientists a pain in the ass

449
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,871
Did you ever talk with Simon never talk to Simon

450
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,151
Never met him

451
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
Never wanted to

452
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
Do you think Julian Simon was entirely wrong

453
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,599
I did not only entirely long colossally look wrong

454
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,183
You it's harder to be more wrong than to say

455
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,279
That the only limit to The Copper human beings can have

456
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,119
Eyes away to the universe or to say that you can grow anything

457
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
Had any number anybody can

458
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Chico

459
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:21,055
You know absolutely nothing about anything important what about some of the more central idea of his

460
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
Which is just that

461
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
You know

462
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:29,503
The human beings are bright and we will add that the economy is not

463
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
Like a butterfly Poppy

464
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
You know that it doesn't crash that is things get expense

465
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Did people find out

466
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:41,279
There's no question at all the people find Alternatives when they get if things get expensive and someone there are

467
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
Plymouth Diner patient that's what he never

468
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
That's what many economist's don't crash

469
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
Did you learn something from the vet

470
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
Yeah don't make bets we certainly made a mistake and making the bed because we lost

471
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
You could argue that the world

472
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Needs are like

473
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
And Simon

474
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
Simon one that bad but

475
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,551
What he was saying to work

476
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
4 Market

477
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,391
To be able to sort out something like pollution or climate change

478
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
You need to relax

479
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
Saying hey

480
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
We got to do something

481
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,047
That's after all what a market is

482
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,399
