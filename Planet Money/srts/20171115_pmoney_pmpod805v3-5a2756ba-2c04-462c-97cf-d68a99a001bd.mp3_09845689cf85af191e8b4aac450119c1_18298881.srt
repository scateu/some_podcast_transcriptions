1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,584
It was supposed to be a simple diplomatic trip

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,120
To some of the poorest countries in

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,168
The time for Action is now

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:12,800
We're not waiting anymore Nikki Haley the US ambassador to the United Nations

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,848
Went to talkative camp for refugee

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,408
People who'd been displaced by the Civil War in

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
South Sudan

8
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:24,320
And then this happened

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,648
The crowds of protesters were so angry and so big

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,696
And they would not be talked down

11
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,000
Enter the Ambassador had to be evacuated

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,048
And police with tear gas

13
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
Recalled into dispersed

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
Here's what they're so angry

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,192
South Sudan has four million people who

16
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,472
Cannot return to their home

17
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,056
Even though the Civil War in South Sudan is basically over

18
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,336
The fighting subsided

19
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
Peace has not come

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
All you have are these

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,432
Peace talks

22
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
The Dragon

23
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
Year after year

24
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,576
South Sudan in the United States have a very special relationship

25
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,880
South Sudan is a country

26
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,208
In large part because of support that it got from the United

27
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
Did States

28
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:07,584
When it decided to break off from Sudan which is its neighbor to the north

29
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
South Sudanese pussy

30
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,168
Become a country for years

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
And meanwhile here in the US

32
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,032
Celebrities kind of glommed onto this cause

33
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,872
Right now we're standing here on the border of Chad and Darfur

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
Lot of bad things are half

35
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
Over here right now

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,992
George Clooney went to South Sudan

37
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,040
And did this video diary with his

38
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,088
His father started in South Sudan

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,136
We are there a lot of refugees

40
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,000
Found a village called Jacques with over thousand displaced family

41
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
South Sudan finally became a country

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
Street in the summer of 2011

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,592
I'm sending good luck to all the South Sudanese and American money

44
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
Since that Independence Day

45
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,968
The US has put 5 billion dollars just in humanitarian Aid

46
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,320
Development and that is one big reason that Nikki Haley was in South Sudan

47
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
She in the Trump Administration

48
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
Have threatened to cut budgets

49
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
For UNP

50
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
They say

51
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,792
These long drawn-out conflict like the one in South

52
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,096
Sudan need to be resolved more quickly

53
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Wait there just

54
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
2

55
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,448
But there's a different way of thinking about

56
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,032
The conflict going on South Sudan or what it'll take to finally end it

57
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
It took me

58
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
Years of going to South Sudan myself

59
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
To even see this thing

60
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,480
And the reason it took me so long to understand it is because I had to kind of

61
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
Rethink

62
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,832
What is money

63
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,440

Before we get to the war story

81
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
What's up with love

82
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,344
I met this guy Gabriel get caught in South Sudan

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,392
The custom-house fell in love

84
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,488
Open College in Nairobi Kenya the fellow student

85
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,304
And when they decide to get married her father's head

86
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
No way

87
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,656
Not until you pay me which is a very common thing in South Sudan is

88
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
Call the bride price

89
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,704
It's like a dowry

90
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
I actually worked in that of South Sudan for a couple years and I was always

91
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
Very impressed

92
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
With the system did you go to a lot of weddings

93
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,248
But the thing about that Dowry that Gabriel has to pay is he could not pay it in

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,392
When I'm Eddie I paid I hate cows that South Sudan accent sometimes swaps

95
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
Steve's 4fc shanghai

96
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
Paid couch

97
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,280
Can do you mind if I ask how many calls you paid

98
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,935
I paid that I will start to fade 85 cows

99
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
My wife is in Decatur

100
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
Her college education

101
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
Increases

102
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Is the price

103
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
So the base price for a dowry would be

104
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,687
50 and 18 cows but if the bride is educated

105
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
You got a triple that

106
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,551
If she lives abroad as she in Gabriel do in Kenya

107
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Then double that again

108
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
Discount because they're actually

109
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
In love

110
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
And

111
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
Total 85 cows that was worth in

112
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
2012 at 14000

113
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,559
Yeah we knew

114
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,119
It was right for me to pay that you know

115
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,911
Beta fire cause

116
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
But I have to comply

117
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
Gabriel does not have any cows

118
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
Self so

119
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
He hits up his family

120
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
What's with Dad

121
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Uncle

122
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
Third cousin finally amasses

123
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
65 cows

124
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,015
20 short I have about another 20 that I need to clear in future

125
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,623
But fortunately his father-in-law accepted an IOU for the other 20 cows

126
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
And the wedding goes for

127
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
But that death

128
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Gabriel definitely plans

129
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,815
It's going to take a few years but don't cows have babies

130
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
But then

131
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
Something happens it's going to change

132
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,983
Only Gabriel's life actually this whole cow system

133
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
Now to the world's youngest Nation

134
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
South Sudan

135
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,895
NPR Gregory Warner is in the South Sudan Capital Juba

136
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:41,759
And I graduate the fighting erupted in Juba little more than a week ago what is the situation like there now

137
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Describe

138
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
Dairy Queen

139
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,927
So this is when I arrived South Sudan as a reporter

140
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
December of 2013

141
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
East Africa correspondent the time

142
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
And what had happened was

143
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
The president in

144
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
In the vice

145
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Hated each other

146
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:01,983
And this fight between these two men triggered a much bigger fight

147
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,823
Gregory I was reporting from South Sudan 8 years before you were there

148
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,639
And the same rivalry was happening then two

149
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,223
Each of these men has his own little army his own militia

150
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
And they divided it along as

151
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
These divisions of gone back

152
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
Decades

153
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:20,159
With the difference now that when I was there South Sudan was its own country

154
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Has its own government

155
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Oil wealth and this

156
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,535
Scramble for power got a lot more

157
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Deadly

158
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Malicious

159
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Attacking civilians from other ethnic group

160
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
Not only killing men

161
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
At the format now targeting women children small baby

162
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,079
People are fleeing and the police there ending up

163
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:44,735
Are these camps run by the United Nation Gabriel the college student takes me into one of these

164
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,551
Camps we've come to talk to villagers about

165
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
The war about the attract

166
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
The thing that they seem to

167
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
Want to talk most about

168
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
Is it

169
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,767
Rampaging militias also

170
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,631
Stole their cows

Okay or okay

ET cast

178

A crowd of kids his

180
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
Powerless into the shade

Militia attacked his village in the middle of the night

00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
Hideout in a swamp

190
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Actually shooting

191
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
At the swamp

192
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
John Escape

193
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
Antifreeze on foot

194
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,255
80 hundred miles

195
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
Ends up at the school and camp

196
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
Sometime after he arrived

197
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
What is UN Safe Haven

198
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
He's looking out the barbed wire fence

199
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,263
And he sees a herd of cows going by

200
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,311
In one of these County record

201
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Hizbul

202
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
A white castrated bull with a beard

203
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:23,039
I'm so sorry this is a silly question from an American but how do you know that that

204
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,647
That white castrated bull with the beard with your castrated bull with the beard

205
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,463
My American let me see Hannah

206
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,743
John explains actually

207
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
He put all these markings

208
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
In the horns

209
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,143
Bell in the beard so he sure that

210
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
Insane

211
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,751
What is an alibi Studio teacher now

212
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
And tomorrow

213
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,103
Simi wedding at the world what would it come to your mind

214
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
I think I actually I think John would have an easier time

215
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Can I recognize

216
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
In his bowl

217
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Then

218
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
I might remember my

219
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
My t-shirt

220
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
Mostly because South Sudanese really care about

221
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
Are caps

222
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
Children aftercare

223
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
Sing songs to their favorite Bowl

224
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
People also just

225
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
Like to talk about cats

226
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,167
There's no way somebody would go for 10 minutes without mentioning your call

227
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
The color of a cow

228
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
This is Michelle Lloyd

229
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
A friend of Gabriel the Coliseum

230
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
We got married

231
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,383
Mission says the cows are not just used for

232
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
Dowry

233
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,967
Actually anytime you have a big purchase so if you want to buy a

234
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
House or

235
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,295
If you happen to murder some

236
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
A customary Court judge

237
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
When I send you

238
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
To jail

239
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
The sentence you to prison

240
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
He will order you to pay cows

241
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,279
You kill somebody and customary law Cortez

242
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,607
YouTube you fly 5 pregnant cows if you give less than that

243
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
People not accept you have to give a pregnant cow

244
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,495
Do you have gas

245
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
Maybe I have one or two

246
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,967
Looks away and give this nervous laugh and I realized

247
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
What did I just ask

248
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023
It's like asking your bank account

249
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
Cows are like your bank account

250
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
It was actually makes a lot of sense in South

251
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,447
Sudan because the banks themselves are

252
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
Really unreliable

253
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:24,383
Are they go bankrupt there's big problems with currency inflation and the country is extremely rural

254
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Very volatile climate Seoul

255
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
1 month

256
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
Strout

257
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Flooding

258
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
And there's also

259
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
The war

260
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Fighting

261
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
Cows have the advantage

262
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,623
You can run with them

263
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Safety

264
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
You can also

265
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Drink their milk

266
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
End

267
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
If you need a bit more protein

268
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
Machine says that you don't have to

269
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
To kill the cow

270
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Is another option

271
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Describe your knife

272
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
And punch

273
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Zayn

274
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,471
The neck of a cow

275
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
That blood is cool

276
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
People can eat it

277
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,615
Instead of killing the whole cow into kind of a blood

278
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Sausage

279
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
Which if you

280
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
Do you think about cows as a pet

281
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
Bank accounts then

282
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
If I can have living off the interest of your savings

283
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
Music app without dipping into

284
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
The principal

285
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
South Sudanese

286
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
Try really hard to not have

287
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
The kill their cows

288
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
They're valued so much

289
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
The Handle With Care

290
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
And you know I would

291
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Able to call

292
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,119
What day is old or young

293
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Represents a certain value

294
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
I don't kill them you kill them

295
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
If that is an important situation

296
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
It's not very easy to kill

297
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,639
So if you think about John guy Giles white castrated bull with the

298
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,991
That not only represents all of his wealth all of his savings

299
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,343
Little Zoe's ability to buy big things to make large purchases

300
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,647
His ability to get his sons married off

301
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
And now all of that is gone

302
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,999
And how do you imagine your future with Outkast

303
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
Ladron. May I see you in awhile

304
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
I can imagine I will lead a terrible life

305
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
And I was out to cause is like there's no lie

306
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,847
If he could get his atk's back or even just some of those cows and

307
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
If you could have peace or

308
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
Protection

309
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
From cattle Raiders

310
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
The future

311
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
He could walk out of this camp tomorrow

312
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
But if he doesn't have cows

313
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
She is going to be stuck in this un camp

314
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
For who-knows-how-long

315
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,743
For John there's a thin line between total dependency and self-reliance

316
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
After I left

317
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
The 10 talking to John Jay Chou

318
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:25,471
Gabriel wanted to show me the rest of this camp

319
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,335
I remember beginning of this war when these camps were nothing they were just

320
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:34,943
An air-filled and it's tearing strips of land no sanitation no shelter

321
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
And now it's been a couple of years into the war so these

322
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
Camps have been built up by

323
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
Did you an invite charitable organization

324
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
In fact there's literally

325
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:50,047
Tractors carving streets and building corrugated tin Shack just kind of a market going on

326
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,631
Sugar sugar and flour

327
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Juice

328
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
And flip flops

329
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,055
People tell me they wouldn't need all this charity office International Aid

330
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
If they could just get their cows

331
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
So I start the Wonder

332
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
Where are those cows

333
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
Now where did they go to

334
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
2 in in the can't be here all these room

335
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Some say that

336
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
River North

337
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
Tested a nor'easter

338
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Ethiopia

339
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
And sold

340
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Slaughter

341
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
They're gone for good

342
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
But

343
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
I found

344
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,911
Have not left the country have moved to areas where they usually don't move to this

345
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
Is Sylvester a my name is Sylvester

346
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
He has

347
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
Seen those cows first hit

348
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Because

349
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
Actually the cattle Raiders

350
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,759
Ask him to come visit us and we talked with Mary

351
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Is dealing with a

352
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
Totally different side

353
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
Massive cow.

354
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Suddenly

355
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,951
All these stolen cows instead of being spread out

356
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
In different places around the

357
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
Each with its own little

358
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
In a patch of grass

359
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Suddenly all the cows are

360
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
Clustered together in these massive

361
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:04,287
Cowherd in the same little area which is flowing

362
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
Heads and heads of animals coming

363
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
I did not record through

364
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:14,783
Daddy what is not flowing anymore

365
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,599
That's that's how dramatic it is

366
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903
It's electric company also how sick

367
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
A lot of cows are

368
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
Hysen whole herd that are just

369
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,255
Emaciated

370
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Drooling

371
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
With something of foot and mouth.

372
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
Because they are

373
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
Living in these overcrowded condition

374
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
Yeah you find diseases

375
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,239
Level switch you are not prepared for

376
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,311
Sylvester knows where the stolen cows are but

377
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,871
That doesn't mean you can return them to their owners

378
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,479
And right now the government and rebel forces are in the middle of yet another round

379
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
The peace talks

380
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
They're going to resume

381
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
In December but these peace talks

382
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
They're not talking about

383
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,903
They talking about stuff like power-sharing

384
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
And what is the timeline for election

385
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Which ethnic group work

386
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
Control which minutes

387
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
And when I was talking to people

388
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
In the UN camps

389
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
Nobody thinks that they're going to get their cows back

390
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,959
Through these peace talks

391
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
They say that the

392
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,823
Politicians that are sitting around negotiating table are the very ones

393
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Who stole their calves

394
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,431
But at the same time nobody thinks that there can be any real

395
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
No peace

396
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
Without cap

397
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
You tell them

398
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,319
Guys what would it take for us to have the consolation

399
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
Michelle Lloyd

400
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
The guy told me a lot about cow life in

401
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
South Sudan

402
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,463
He talks to people about what it will take to me

403
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
People look at you

404
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,303
What a way to clean siding

405
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
How can I man

406
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
With our two arms without two legs

407
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,495
Negotiate with somebody with two legs and two arms

408
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
No

409
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
He has cause we don't have calls

410
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
He buns are hot

411
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Is Billy Miller hot

412
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
You know he keep my parents

413
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,527
Hispanics are not even sleeping in the air condition place

414
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
Two people are saying

415
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:57,951
You know when you talk about consideration it doesn't make sense you know you can order

416
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,511
Reconciliation after a brutal War

417
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
Is one of the hardest things there is

418
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,399
It's a really big part of South Sudan sister you know I was there a decade ago

419
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,007
Covering an entirely different conflict and an entirely different

420
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,799
Attempt at reconciliation

421
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
But one that looks

422
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
Remarkably similar

423
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,711
You know in the US was involved in the UN was involved all these Western Powers were involved

424
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,039
I will say one other ingredient that soften involved

425
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
Successful reconciliation

426
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391
Is the sacrifice

427
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Have a cat

428
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
There's songs about this

429
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,535
There's a famous peace agreement in 1999 which was

430
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
Accelerated with the sacrifice of a very beautiful

431
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
Ocala until

432
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
And when I was in

433
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
The UN Camp I was asking

434
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,751
People hate you remember this song I wanted to hear it

435
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
For myself

436
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,335
And finally this one Village Chiefs that forwarding

437
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
And he said well

438
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127

439
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663

Dinner in the sky

464
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,127
And there's no cows at home

465
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
