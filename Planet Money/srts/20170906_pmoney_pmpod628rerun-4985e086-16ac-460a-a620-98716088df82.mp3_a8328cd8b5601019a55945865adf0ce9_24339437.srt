00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:06,656
Back in the 1950s Tom Burrell was in high school and he had to take one of those aptitude test

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,472
Test to tell you what you should be when you grow up

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,496
And take the test

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,568
Any score super high in persuasiveness

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,360
And artistic ability

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,896
A teacher says

7
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,224
Persuasiveness artistic ability is only one profession for you

8
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,248

00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:25,856
Copperhill is not the kind of guy who shies away from things as he gets to college and he's like

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,648
Bring on the advertising world

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,232
Well a professor of his system down and tells them

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,536
You are smart you are persuasive

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,584
The problem is there are no black

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,608
People in advertising

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,656
Stilt tumbrl is not dissuaded

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,216
He sees an opening in the mail room

17
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
In the Mailroom

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,288
Wait advertising in Chicago when he applies

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312

00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,592
He is the only app

21
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,872
He is a shoe-in

22
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,176
Well except this is 90

23
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,760
Tohara me was a major

24
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,064
Senior Management decision

25
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:02,464
The chairman the president the Executive Vice President senior vice president

26
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,816
They met and conferred over the issue of even hiring a

27
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,352
A negro

28
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,912
And then after they interviewed me

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,776
They met to determine whether they were going to go ahead with this

30
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,104
Quote revolutionary kind of move to hire a

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640

Isabelle Rowe

36
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808
In the Mailroom

37
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,904
That was a major executive decision that brought the chairman

38
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,464
All the way back from his

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,864
His home in Delray Florida is to have a meeting to decide that

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,264
And after deliberating the decision was made they let him in he got the job

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
And now Tom Burrell with something few people at Sea before

42

A black man in advertising hello and welcome to Planet Money Robert Smith

43

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
Advertising thinks about us

61

57
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,808
Tom Burrell has started his new job in the Mailroom and he looks around at Wade advertising Chicago

58
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,856
And he realizes this place

59
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
Is about

60
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,928
As boring as you can get

61
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
It had these

62
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
Really

63
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
Safe kind of big brands

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
Never took any chance

65
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
Robin Hood flour

66
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Alka-Seltzer

67
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
The Grand ole Opry

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,448
Advertising. The time was that

69
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
To sell products

70
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
It had to be

71
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,080
Really sort of generic nothing too spicy to offend anybody

72
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
One-size-fits-all

73
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
Target at everyone who

74
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Who owns Nutella

75
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
With Alka-Seltzer

76
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,808
Relief is just a swallow

77
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,184
It probably goes without saying that you could watch Alka-Seltzer ads

78
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
All day long in the 1960s

79
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
And never see a non-white face

80
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
Burrell wheelie light

81
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
Happy gif

82
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
An Advertiser

83
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
People are good to him they treated him well

84
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
And then where

85
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,824
None of those awkward moments that you might expect

86
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,128
From being the only black guy in the Asia

87
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,664
Except for one

88
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
You know it was Progressive Party

89
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
It's always the Christmas party Robert

90
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
This is when the CFO

91
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
The company walks up to him

92
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
Says Tom

93
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Beetle

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
We're happy you're here

95
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
And

96
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
We're wondering if

97
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
Next year

98
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
You would

99
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
Be willing are interested

100
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,911
And singing some down-home songs

101
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,151
So what were you thinking

102
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,711
I think I think I did the same thing

103
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
I think I laughed

104
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
Who's home

105
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
And he never got it

106
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
For the record you never sang at the office Christmas party

107
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
And he didn't really stay in the Mailroom

108
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
He started writing copy coming up with

109
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
Folksy language

110
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
To self flower

111
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
He even made a big pitch

112
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
For the agency

113
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
These big account

114
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,567
He had a veggie idea that involve the sick monkey and Alka-Seltzer it was

115
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Was weird it was

116
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Crazy

117
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
But it never got made

118
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,479
After just a few years Tom barrels ambition

119
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Was too big

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,855
For Wade advertising he found another agency willing to let him do edger stuff

121
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Needham Harper

122
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
And they they didn't have to fly the CEO in from Florida

123
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Approve his hire

124
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
Tom was the first

125
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Black

126
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,911
Copy supervisor we'd ever had in the agency and

127
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,239
He's very tall

128
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,311
Good-looking has a good voice and he was very gifted

129
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,383
Creative guy so we were we were drawn to him

130
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
Keith Reinhardt was copyrighted there in the 60s

131
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
And I'm sure

132
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
You know his work

133
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
You'll feel better

134
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Better knowing

135
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
Anytime anywhere

136
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
I'd like a good neighbor

137
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,439
State farm is there and we got lots of

138
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
Letters from English teachers who

139
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
Objected to our use of

140
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
Like a good neighbor

141
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
Instead of as a good neighbor but

142
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
Stayed with us and they're still using it today

143
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,287
This agency would go on to be one of those big

144
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Historic

145
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Innovators

146
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Advertising

147
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,919
It keeps right on to the Tom Burrell was one of the best copywriter

148
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
They had

149
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
And in Wynwood advertising agencies work

150
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
These two are both

151
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
Colleagues but they were also

152
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Competitor

153
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,135
The two men were often pitted against each other

154
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
To see who could come up with the best eye

155
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,023
One incident I remember when we were both given the assignment to

156
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Convince

157
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,679
People to try Continental Airlines because they had wider seats new wider seat

158
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:37,311
And we tried to crack it and Tom and his group just nailed it I think it was Tom himself

159
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
Who came up with this idea to

160
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,639
Reprint

161
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
The

162
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Seat cushions

163
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,295
Of these new wider seats on Continental Airlines and a double

164
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
Page newspaper spread

165
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
And the headline simply invited readers to

166
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
To sit down on the newspaper spread

167
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
NC

168
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
How

169
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
How much wider it was how much more comfortable

170
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
I mean he really killed it

171
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,399
Remember Robert we're talking about the

172
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
In Chicago

173
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
Civil Rights Movement is going on

174
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,031
And in Chicago there's sort of a

175
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
Harlem Renaissance

176
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
You got Ebony magazine

177
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
Important Beauty Outlet

178
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,967
For African Americans definitely at the time

179
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015
And their ad reps are going around saying

180
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
This is a black magazine

181
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,367
The ads have to have black people in them

182
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
And that woke up a lot of

183
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:27,487
People in the advertising world and the consumer Market World in Chicago

184
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,303
Is advertising agency said oh yeah okay

185
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
We need a black people in these

186
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,167
So what they would do is they would write a script

187
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
4 TV ads

188
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
Build a sad

189
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
And personally would hire white actors

190
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,127
Like in this ad for Crest there these two white kids brushing their teeth at a sink

191
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,783
I never be Greg Surplus the toothpaste test Brookside use the same two faces mine for without

192
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
Starset my side hewescraft

193
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,135
And had 42% fewer cavities

194
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
Celebrities with the white

195
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,487
And then the end of the day swap out the cute white

196
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
Kids for equally cute black

197
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
And having pretty much do the same at

198
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
I never could talk Jeff

199
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,471
Been in a toothpaste test we're on opposite sides

200
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
Pyside use crest

201
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
Yes I do the same to Facebook without florestan

202
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
That's what I be Jeff

203
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,199
Cuz my side at 21% fewer cavities with Chris

204
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,783
Bro says it was pretty comical how little they thought

205
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
About black

206
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Consumers Energy

207
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,159
You tell me this one famous story of a State Farm ad

208
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
That they wanted to change

209
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Ebony magazine

210
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Now the original ad

211
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
Had a white couple laying in bed

212
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
There was a photograph

213
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
On the side

214
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Of the bed

215
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,959
And this is a family photograph

216
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
And so then they did a blank version

217
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
Of that same ad

218
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,639
But they forgot to change the photograph

219
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
So you got this blanket

220
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
He gets his wife family

221
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
What's the forecast for white family

222
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Beside

223
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
Add so that was one

224
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Example

225
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:02,207
Another example is that Schaefer's

226
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Beer

227
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,239
A lot of Brands like Schaefer's like to rely on the stalgia you know

228
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,287
Thinking about the good old days

229
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,639
Well reply people the good old days weren't that good especially

230
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
When

231
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,711
It was before the Emancipation Proclamation

232
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
And at the time

233
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
The line was

234
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
18

235
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
50

236
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Sex

237
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
That was a

238
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
Very Good Year

239
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
4 beer

240
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
It was a very bad year for black people

241
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,375
And this this ad is showing up in Ebony magazine

242
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,959
There's something really strategically wrong with this

243
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:49,823
Talking about how good a year 1856 was

244
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
4 beer

245
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
And

246
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
It just

247
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Screamed

248
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Insensitivity

249
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Screamed at

250
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
It was a

251
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Horrible

252
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Year

253
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
For us

254
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
Robert you can imagine

255
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,439
Just how weird this was

256
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
You got a black guy who's working

257
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
All white advert

258
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
Intemporel is going home

259
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
To the south side of Chicago

260
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Which is

261
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,655
Erupting

262
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
In the Civil Rights Movement

263
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
And they're the slogans

264
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
Black Panthers

265
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
And there's this idea of black power

266
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
You know what she wrestles with this idea

267
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
And he decides

268
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
He's going to come up

269
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
With his own slogan

270
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
That's especially me

271
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
For the advertising world

272
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
Black people are not

273
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
Dark skin white people

274
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,463
You know when we talk to people about Tom Burrell

275
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
They quote this almost

276
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
Verbatim

277
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Back to us

278
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
He said it so often

279
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Black people

280
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
Are not dark-skinned White

281
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
People in fact

282
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
Well decide to finally

283
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
Start his own advertising

284
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,543
Confirm really based on this Prince

285
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
A black

286
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Advertising agency

287
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,919
The understood and could sell to the black consumer

288
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
902

289
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
This seems immensely Avi

290
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,295
What are the time it felt like

291
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
You know a real slap in the face to these

292
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
Waiting to see if you worked

293
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
I had some

294
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
Reservations about 2

295
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,255
Some of the things he was saying

296
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
You may remember X collie

297
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Keith Reinhard

298
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,351
Whether or not we

299
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:22,239
Ask occasion the creative people would be able to appeal to the black audience I felt it too

300
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,335
We could and that we had in some cases but it was pretty hard to argue

301
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
With time when he said

302
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,455
You know blacks are not white people with dark

303
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,807
Skin I mean we have a culture of our own and we need to express that

304
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
So Tom Burrell eventually got a partner

305
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Mukbang

306
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
And they formed the firm

307
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
Darrell McFadden

308
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
One of the first all-black a date

309
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,119
In 1971 who would eventually become Burrell Communications

310
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
And the big Brands came running

311
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Desperate

312
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,751
Translate Jack Daniels Ford and one of his

313
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,335
Big first clients was Philip Morris and the Marlboro Man

314
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
This was a big

315
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Hauppauge

316
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Selling the Marlboro Man

317
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
The African American

318
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
The Marlboro Man was this

319
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
Rugged cowboy

320
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Who was always filmed on horseback

321
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
In like a Utah like landscape

322
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
Smoking cig

323
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
The longhorn

324
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
Come to Marlboro Country

325
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,303
Marlboro 100

326
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
I don't even know where to start I mean

327
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,935
First of all restarting my Longhorns you you've lost me

328
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
You lost me on Longhorns

329
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,823
I'm done and then when you start talking about a hundred years ago

330
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,151
You lost me on that too because that's the last thing I want to do

331
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
Is go back

332
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
A hundred years

333
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Ago

334
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
With a bunch of

335
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,135
Rural cowboy

336
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
White guys

337
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
That doesn't sound

338
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
How to safe

339
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
Philip Morris wanted

340
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
Create a black Marlboro

341
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
And of course

342
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Became the Tom Burrell

343
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
What did you do to make it

344
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,471
Make it a PO to Someone Like You

345
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
Well I took it out of the

346
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,311
Marlboro Country and I put it into the city

347
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
That's one thing

348
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,967
And the Marlboro Man became a very cool City

349
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
City dude very well very stylish well

350
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Dressed

351
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
Cool had a bit cool Factor going

352
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
Gone with the cowboy hat the big belt buckle

353
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
The New Black Marlboro Man

354
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Heather sweat

355
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,559
And he sits there and stares out not at the range

356
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
But it is Swanky Library

357
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
Urbane Urban

358
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
Is definitely

359
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Not a Cowboys fan

360
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
We changed the line

361
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Which is almost

362
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Last may we change the lion from

363
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
Come to where the flavor is

364
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
And the light was simply

365
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Where

366
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,991
The flavor is

367
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
So

368
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
We're basically saying that

369
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
The city

370
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
Where black people are

371
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Is where the

372
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
The flavor is

373
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,999
Burrell did was take this General marketing

374
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Had

375
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
And

376
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
He tailored it

377
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
For a black audience

378
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,191
But if you really did want to be finishing someone else's work

379
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,263
Monkey doing something bigger he had a bigger vision

380
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
To craft

381
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
Then add in a campaign

382
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
From the ground up

383
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
And he got

384
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
The chats

385
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
He got the biggest

386
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,527
Chance that an ad agency can Dad have you seen Mad Men you know what this means

387
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
McDonald's call

388
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
McDonald's Caldwell actually this guy

389
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Call

390
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Paul shrage

391
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,023
You're in charge of marketing at McDonald's for quite a while right

392
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
McDonald's

393
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
And the 1970s McDonald's

394
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
One goal and one goal only

395
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Grow

396
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
Aggressively

397
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
Crowded already conquered the suburbs

398
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
He wanted to move big into the city

399
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,127
It what it became apparent that the black consumer

400
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
Was growing in numbers and import

401
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
End up

402
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,039
Celtic we need is somebody that was specialized

403
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
In that area

404
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,367
But I think this is one of those moments where at

405
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,903
The phrase call Tom Burrell

406
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Came out of the conference

407
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,815
Yeah it wasn't like they were you know sheets and Chiefs a black advertising agent

408
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
Is that the time

409
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,935
And when Tom Burrell finally sat down with McDonald's can't explain to them

410
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
Not hey guys you need to sell the black people

411
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
That part they got

412
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
But it was the way

413
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,103
The African Americans interact

414
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Whittier restaurants

415
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Is different

416
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
The way

417
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
In the commercial that the time they would show white family

418
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
Piling into the car

419
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,575
The idea was that

420
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
McDonald's to this was a tree

421
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
A destination

422
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
In the black community

423
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
McDonald's

424
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
Meant something complete

425
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,863
McDonald's was not used as a place where the family would go

426
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
McDonald's

427
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
Was used

428
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,727
As a place where working people would go

429
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
And take a break

430
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
Whatever they had a chance

431
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,359
It was a place where children would go very often

432
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
By themselves

433
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
The average check

434
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
For a

435
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,039
Family going to McDonald's on these special occasions

436
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Was larger

437
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
The frequency was less

438
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
The average check in the black community was hot

439
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,743
Smaller Mickey is running in and out getting french fries

440
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,535
It's this big realization

441
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,327
Which was the McDonald's

442
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Wasn't just

443
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
A place to

444
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,471
McDonald's was also place to work with a major employer in the city

445
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
And so we launched a series of ads

446
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Noting industry ads

447
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
Pelvic is about the kid named Calvin

448
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:22,015
Hey isn't that Calvin I haven't seen him for a while I want the wave hit

449
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
You got a job at 8

450
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Hip hop beat

451
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,159
Will it shows a young black teenager he strolling through the

452
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Hood

453
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
Which looks strangely like

454
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
Brooklyn set on the back lot at

455
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,423
Responsibility

456
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,823
He's working welcome to McDonalds help you

457
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Funny now it's

458
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Beds are a little bit

459
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
Eazy-E in straight ahead

460
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
But the thing is

461
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,479
They were really successful when they ran for a decade

462
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
Can you follow Calvin

463
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
As he work this way up

464
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
To becoming a manager

465
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,095
I'm pretty sure that in the alternative universe

466
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Calvin is living in

467
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
The owns McDonald

468
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
Well you probably owns like a whole chain

469
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,031
Is somebody watched a lot of TV in the 80s

470
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
It couldn't happen to a nicer guy

471
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
By the time this ad aired

472
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
Tom Burrell

473
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
Was certifiably

474
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
Famous he was this huge name

475
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,575
In advertising you what happens when you're a huge payment advertising

476
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
You also get a lot of credits

477
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,951
And there were people at the time we said look yeah you made a 6

478
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975
Excessive

479
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,071
But you made a success since industry by selling brands that weren't exactly

480
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
High end luxury brand

481
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Health food

482
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
And I have that

483
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
In your early success some of the accounts to

484
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,543
She got were the Marlboro Man we just talked about

485
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
Jack Daniel

486
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,895
The obvious question would be in these are not the best thing

487
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,455
Forever ever in America

488
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,783
That's right and in this is how you're making your living

489
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
How do you feel about

490
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
Oii struggled

491
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
With that and I struggle with

492
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,743
Rome ended up dropping the cigarette clients pretty early on in

493
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
In his career

494
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,559
What's important to note is that

495
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
At the time throw realize the kind of platform that he

496
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
Had with McDonald's

497
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,239
He had a theory that he wanted to work on it was called

498
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
Positive Realty

499
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Richmond

500
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,335
Putting regular black people in real life

501
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Equations

502
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
On television

503
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,735
It it had that kind of positive effect even though

504
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
Arguably

505
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
We were selling things

506
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
To them

507
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
That as we see now we're not

508
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Good for

509
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Them

510
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
And

511
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
It out but there were no things

512
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,279
That I recall selling that I

513
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
Declined to use

514
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,679
And what people saw that he was successful with doing that with McDonald

515
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
A lot of the other big American blue chip brands

516
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:55,103
Running to American Airlines Toyota Procter & Gamble General Mills cereal

517
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
Any slogan that black

518
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,735
People aren't dark skin white people became

519
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,551
But not just related to African American

520
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,879
That the Bro principal was one size doesn't fit all

521
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
In each group needs to be

522
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Taking into account

523
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
What Burrell did

524
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
Open the door

525
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,815
For the kind of

526
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,119
Ethnic micro-targeting that we see

527
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
Today

528
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
Robert Clara is contributing editor at Apple

529
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:26,079
And the way that he did that was by making mainstream Brands not just aware

530
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,479
Of the black community as a very viable community of consumers but he also firm

531
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Furnish them

532
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:38,367
With a means to reach them that was new and effective

533
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,439
And then once that in and of itself became

534
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,487
A mainstream thing

535
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,607
The Natural Evolution of that Trend was then for advertisers

536
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,703
Just say oh well then there must be other groups that we can reach out to

537
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:58,079
And the idea of specialized advertising targeted demographic advertising

538
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,151
Grows out of that but you wouldn't have had that

539
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:06,527
If you didn't have the initial awareness of the broader demographic group that Pharrell helped

540
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
To create

541
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,111
Cumberland is basically retired now though he does some

542
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
Consulting

543
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,463
Turtle trying to help major brand understand how to use or not use

544
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Use Hip Hop

545
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
After all this time

546
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
You still have to

547
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Teach the same lesson

548
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Since he was teaching

549
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
50 years ago

550
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,399
Yeah that marketing if you're not targeting

551
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
And so

552
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,543
This whole business about one-size-fits-all I mean to steal our kind of a

553
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,127
Up movement out of part of Wishful Thinking clients

554
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
To say hey

555
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
Can't we just

556
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,063
Talk to one group of people in so much easier

557
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,647
But the whole thing is it is it is that

558
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,439
We now have the app

559
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
The ability

560
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
To really get in and talk to people

561
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
More individual

562
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
Basin

563
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,119
Now marketers realised it would be ridiculous

564
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
To just try to sell

565
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,191
The black guy or the white

566
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
It's about selling.

567
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
Young black

568
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,895
Gay guy who lives in West Hollywood plays golf listen to Frank Sinatra and likes public radio

569
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
Wait wait wait wait

570
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
You play golf

571
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,807
Idea Robert is that more and more

572
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Who is this ad really for

573
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
Now you're supposed to think

574
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,464
This ad is especially

575
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,864
For me

576
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,704
Mary Clinton ladies and gentlemen

577
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240

587
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Futanari

588
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
Recently talked

589
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
With one of our colleagues Gene Demby

590
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,112
He's one of the hosts of the code switch podcast

591
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,184
And they talked about this episode in particular

592
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
And Woodstock

593
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,024
One of the things I thought was really fascinating

594
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,096
What's this phenomenon that you decided you wanted to call

595
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
The Oprah effect

596
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,656
What is the Oprah effect

597
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:36,032
Well it's something that Tom Burrell said to me that we couldn't get into the podcast which is that the

598
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,592
Ads that he made that were

599
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
For Africa

600
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
Can Americans

601
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
Did better with the white audience

602
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,480
Then the General Market

603
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Advertising

604
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
So what you're saying is that

605
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
White people

606
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Doug

607
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,904
Ads meant for black people

608
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
More than they like ads

609
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,744
With white people meant for white people

610
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,280
Fiat the ads ever

611
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:00,864
Specifically aimed at African Americans did better with the white

612
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,216
And what that sort of shows and we can see it and affecting our lives right

613
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
And that's why I called the Oprah

614
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,872
You know my mom will watch Oprah assuming your mom watches Oprah

615
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,432
Any number of

616
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:17,504
Minority women will watch another minority woman

617
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,856
The Genius of Oprah is that she gets the women of color

618
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:26,208
The white one and two and then we see this all over

619
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
It's a little weird to think of

620
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,816
What time parole was doing when he came out these ideas

621
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
A subversive right I mean

622
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,704
Oh mama what you just trying to get more people into McDonald's so they buy more french fries right but

623
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,984
On another level

624
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,056
It's hard not to think of what tamburro was doing

625
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,920
As when he's talking about positive realism as political right he's trying to

626
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,224
Make space for black people

627
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
In mainstream American

628
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
Let me know

629
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
Nobody came up with these ID

630
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
In the sixties

631
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
In the 70s

632
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
He's a part of the

633
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Cultural

634
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
Conversation

635
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,744
Tomberlin and Jesse Jackson

636
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,512
They talk

637
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,792
I mean Tom Burrell

638
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,816
Is with

639
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
A group of

640
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
Men

641
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Mainly men

642
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
Time

643
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,240
Who are transforming the way African American

644
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,336
I seen an advertising and he's thinking politically

645
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:18,688
He's looking through you know Martin Luther King coming to Chicago and living

646
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,992
This is really important to him

647
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:27,392
Showing African Americans in a positive light

648
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,768
Hillary Clinton and Jean Denver one of the host of NPR's code switch podcast

649
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:39,168
Which can I say you should check out by Gene and the coach which team is original reporting on
