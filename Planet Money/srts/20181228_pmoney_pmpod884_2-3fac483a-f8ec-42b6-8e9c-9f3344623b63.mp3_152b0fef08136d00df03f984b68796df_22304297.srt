1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,072
The other day I called up next

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,632
Hey Michael Michael works at the Mothership

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,400
A fundraiser

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,960
Airworthy Association of fundraising

5
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:12,288
Professionals there truly is an association for every

6
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,592
They're absolutely yes

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,384
And we were calling Michael

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,408
Because there's sort of

9
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,200
Existential crisis

10
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
His world right now

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,760
There's a new tax law

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
Ann in it

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,576
There's less of an incentive

14
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,136
Turn on rich people to donate to charity

15
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,928
And then write it off on their taxes

16
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,232
And told Michael's question is

17
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,304
Will ice not so rich people still donate

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,608
That's basically the $1000000 question

19
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,376
Right now

20
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,192
It's like we're all part of some giant economic

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,752
And Michael says we won't have the results

22
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,520
Until the new year

23
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
December

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
Is critical and the last

25
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,592
Suica December

26
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,872
Can actually get crazy

27
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,968
To look we're in economics show we know there's less of an incentive

28
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,504
Good for you to donate this

29
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,296
But maybe

30
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,088
If we ask

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
So

32
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
Pretty please

33
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:04,000

36
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,960
Has made us all a little

37
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Reflective

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,568
We here at Planet Money have looked into a lot of different things this year

39
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,896
We know that the story does not end when we turn off our microphone

40
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
Sootoday

41
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456
We give you

42
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,760
Apologies to radio Legend Paul Harvey

43
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
The rest of the story

44
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
You know I was expecting like

45
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:36,256
Fox News and CNN and CBS to all the out here

46
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,072
With their like live shot and yes

47
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,400
Maybe we're just early maybe they don't know where he is

48
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,496
That is our very own Kenny Malone and Nick Fountain reporting an

49
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
Update on episode 850

50
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
T7 postal Illuminati

51
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
That was the episode where a

52
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,640
A listener had

53
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,408
Emailed us

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
Pharisee Theory

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
Which

56
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
Found out with ex

57
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Play true

58
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
It was about a worldwide

59
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
Secretive

60
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,136
Postal organization the universal Postal Union or

61
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
PU

62
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,256
Do upu sets Mail rates all over the world and those Mail rates

63
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
Transamerica

64
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Pretty bummed

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,656
Like it can cost more to send a package to your neighbor then for somebody in

66
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
China

67
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,472
To send that same package to your neighbor

68
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
There has been a

69
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
Huge update

70
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,664
Since we first reported this story and Nick and Kenny were on the scene as the news broke a few months ago

71
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,736
They went to talk to The Listener who first told us about this James

72
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Small town

73
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,808
All right Nick and Kenny are going to take it

74
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,928
Less than a month after we publish that episode the Trump Administration announced

75
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,744
That they were looking into this Universal Postal Union

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
No we're not saying Trump listen to Planet money or not

77
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Not saying you

78
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
Probably doesn't

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
What today October 17

80
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,472
The Trump Administration announced

81
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
We're done with the

82
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,056
We are planning to leave the universal postal u

83
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
So immediately we thought

84
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,176
The conspiracy theorist was Baker

85
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:04,320
And we found out he's attending an e-commerce Meetup in New York City right now so we rushed down here

86
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
The lower Manhattan

87
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,160
And we are right now waiting for Jamie smaldone

88
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
To walk out of this building

89
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
We are

90
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
A press gaggle

91
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,144
Up to

92
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
You guys are crazy

93
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
Today's a big day male

94
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
A momentous day in mail

95
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
A fantastic day for America

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
Nodejs if we're being serious here

97
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,272
We don't actually think of the Trump Administration listened to episode 857

98
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Planet Money

99
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
What is more likely though is it you've been

100
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256
Out there talking about how American small businesses are disadvantaged against their foreign competitors because of

101
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
Rules at the upu itself

102
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
There is a chance that you had something to do

103
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,632
With his decision today

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,936
How are you feeling man

105
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
I think it's incredible that

106
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,056
Someone can complain and get a result in this country

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Majestic

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,432
Has anyone told you that you specifically had a hand in this happening

109
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
What who told you that

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
The president

111
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
How do you speak to the president directly but I

112
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,856
I've connected with people in the White House and

113
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
People in Senate and Congress end

114
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
I think

115
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,303
Got this was an underlying issue and really my only part was just elevating the awareness

116
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
Seems like it's

117
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
Timmy results I think

118
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Pretty fast

119
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
Yeah so

120
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Resolve

121
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
Like they're definitely some bad things about the universal Postal Union when it comes to like small businesses like yours but also

122
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
What kind of make

123
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
Global Mail work

124
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,551
Youth Administration just break Global Mail

125
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,927
I don't know exactly how everything is going to play out right I think that's

126
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,463
For the future to tell but

127
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
I think that they'll figure out a way

128
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,863
Continue out of the mail flow around the world I think that my

129
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,399
My feeling is that old

130
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
Only this one thing will get

131
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
Alright Jamie smaldone

Go right

162
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,351
Hey Noel you are here to give us

163
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:01,471
An update on a story that you reported earlier this year episode number 817 we called it

164
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:07,871
The gun man okay it was a very big development in the story over the summer and then there was a very unexpected

165
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Twist as well

166
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,271
So lister's might remember this episode was about a man named Cody Wilson

167
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,087
He was the first person to ever successfully

168
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Make a gun

169
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,159
Using a 3D printer

170
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
He made a pistol

171
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
And

172
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
He took the blueprints for how to make that gun

173
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,607
Any put them online so that anyone in the world could access them

174
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,423
Fist of course made lawmakers

175
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
Very nervous because

176
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,519
You cannot Trace these guns which is out police officer

177
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Consult

178
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,383
That's right and when lawmakers came after him in the press and said

179
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
What you're doing is dangerous

180
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
Cody's response was to tell lawmakers to go to hell like he openly mocked them in the media he said

181
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
You cannot stop me

182
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:56,511
Which I assume went over well with the government loves being told to go to hell 2015

183
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
Cody got a letter from the state

184
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,191
Department and it said you are in violation of the law and you need to take those blueprints offline

185
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
Sweet takes the blueprints down

186
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,567
But he turns around and he sues the government

187
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,151
He says what the government is doing is a violation of my

188
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:18,271
First Amendment so he's basically putting like a right-wing issue on the back of a

189
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,087
More like left-wing argue

190
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,951
In fact some of the top First Amendment lawyers in the country ended up represent

191
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Okay so that

192
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,279
Brings us to our first update

193
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Yes

194
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
This summer

195
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:36,191
Out of the blue the government settled with Cody Wilson and gave him permission to

196
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,519
Put the blueprints for the 3D printed gun back online

197
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,871
And then immediately a group of State Attorneys General got together

198
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,687
And they sued the Trump Administration

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,039
Oh wow for having allowed Cody to put the the blueprints back online

200
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,855
A federal judge then gets involved in says

201
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
Everyone freeze

202
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Until

203
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
I've had a chance to look at some things and make

204
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,815
Point Cody takes the blueprints back offline

205
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
Andis company says

206
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
Alright fine

207
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,703
You're not going to let us put them online will sell them to people through the mail

208
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,239
And that's what they start doing

209
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
That was what was happening late this summer

210
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
And then

211
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,919
There was a really surprising

212
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Twist

213
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
In Cody Wilson

214
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Story

215
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,575
A 16 year old girl in Austin Texas where Cody lives

216
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
Went to a counselor

217
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:32,767
And told the counselor that she met Kodi on a pay for sex website and that the two of them had

218
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Sex in a hotel room

219
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
And that Cody paid her for it

220
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
The police investigated

221
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,215
And they charge Cody with 2nd degree sexual assault

222
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Wow yeah

223
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,311
And Cody left the company that he founded

224
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
So the fight

225
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,663
That he started he's kind of had to recuse himself

226
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
That's right

227
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,503
And if he's convicted Keys facing up to 20 years

228
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,063
And if he is convicted he's a

229
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
The Felon in which case he cannot own guns

230
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
Yeah that maybe is the final twist

231
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,999
Wow this is not how

232
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
I think anyone thought.

233
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
Story was going to

234
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:12,959
And now everybody was really astonished alright thanks the well by the way we did Reach Out

235
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,775
To Cody Wilson for comment but he did not respond

236
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,735
4A next update we are going to take you back to episode 845 called Redman

237
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,575
And in this episode we talk to a Republican strategist

238
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
Named Chris Jankowski he is

239
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
Architect of red map

240
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,487
Which was a republican plan to control redistricting

241
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,791
Monster round 2009-2010

242
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,607
And it allowed Republicans to gerrymander maps

243
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Across the country

244
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
And

245
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,007
They hoped login a republican Advantage for at least

246
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,871
And it did look like it was working for years after 2010 when this

247
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Implemented

248
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
The maps did start to favor

249
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
Republicans in a lot of different state

250
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:03,135
In fact when I started reporting on gerrymandering 2 years ago I called him a bunch of Democrats and back then in two thousand

251
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
16

252
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
They said what

253
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,023
Because of gerrymandering there is no way we can win back the house like

254
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
It's basically not even

255
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Possible

256
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Then

257
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
As we all saw this fall

258
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Terms happened

259
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
The Democrats

260
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,775
Will win the majority

261
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,895
In the US House of Representatives as I was watching these results come in

262
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
I was thinking about Redman

263
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
And I was wondering

264
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,063
What is this mean for gerrymandering does it mean that gerrymandering does

265
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Work

266
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
Is it not the boogeyman that we think it is

267
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,487
So I called back Chris Jankowski that read math guy and he told me look

268
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
These results

269
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,351
Let's prove what I have been trying to tell people for a long time

270
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
I've said all along

271
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
District Lines

272
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
Only so influential he said

273
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799
You can't lock in partisan advantage

274
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
And it's forever

275
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
Because of how the maps are drawn

276
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
You are using

277
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
The previous 10 years really

278
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
2

279
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
Draw maps for the next

280
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
And

281
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
Each election cycle

282
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
The data is

283
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
Less reliable

284
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
There's population shifts

285
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
Unforeseen political issues

286
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
And when he said that I thought yeah

287
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,631
Population should have been forcing political issues

288
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,703
Does feel like we've had a few of those since 2016

289
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,055
And so what Chris concludes from the midterms is

290
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,127
That voters can overrule the match they are not all pow

291
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,807
But I wanted I got check so I also called Kelli Ward who is the executive director of The National

292
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
Democratic redistricting

293
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
10 committee

294
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
And she sees something very

295
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Endorsement

296
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,487
As you pointed to Pennsylvania

297
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
That is a swing state

298
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
That have been gerrymandered to benefit

299
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,679
But after a long battle the courts recently redrew the map

300
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239
Enfys less gerrymandered Maps

301
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
They got less gerrymandered results

302
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
Going into the midterms Democrats

303
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
Had only

304
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
5c

305
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
And Republicans had

306
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
13

307
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
But with these newly drawn Maps

308
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,087
The new map created A99 outcome which is rep

309
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Representative of a

310
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
A swing state like

311
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
Pennsylvania button stays

312
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:18,815
It did not try to undo partisan gerrymandering states that remained gerrymandered States like

313
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Ohio

314
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
And North Carolina

315
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,167
And Georgia and Wisconsin

316
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Democrats want about 50

317
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
Percent of the vote in those States

318
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
But only have

319
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
You know between 25 and

320
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
30% of the seats in them

321
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,015
Sowell Christie's the midterm results as proof that gerrymandering is not as powerful monster as everyone says

322
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Kelly sees the results

323
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
Approve of just

324
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,111
How bad it actually is

325
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,975
Anyway around it of course all eyes are now on 20/20

326
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
My eyes

327
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
Personally are on 2021 because

328
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
That is when they

329
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
Will be redrawn

330
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
And I asked Chris

331
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
Will will you be working on redis

332
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
Starting this next Ranger

333
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
Others

334
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Stepped up and

335
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
And I will not be doing anything with

336
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
You sound happy about

337
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,919
I am very happy about that

338
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:12,063
After the break we tell you about a surprising twist in a story we've reported in

Dan you are in the DC office today we are talking on the phone Dan Charles he

355
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
Is a reporter in the DC Bureau

356
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,447
You reported a great story for us last summer called

357
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
Yes in my backyard or yanby

358
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,103
It's a movement in the San Francisco Bay Area to build more housing and

359
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,175
Jimmy is a play on NIMBY which is not in my backyard

360
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,479
Enough people who are opposed to more housing

361
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,855
As I understand it a few things have happened since you first reported this last summer first of all

362
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:21,951
The I guess we can call her the chief DMV of our stories Sonja trauss

363
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
She launched this whole DMV movement and when we did our episode she was running for a seat on the San Francisco board

364
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Supervisor

365
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
And the first thing I want to know is if she want

366
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
No

367
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
She lost

368
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
Damon Thor

369
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
But there is something else

370
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,151
Something that was happening behind the scenes while I was reporting a tapas

371
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
And nobody even knew about

372
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
That sounds mysterious

373
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,111
One of the places where this housing battles been going on is the city of Lafayette east of San Francisco

374
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:55,743
There were two things first they were trying to block construction of a big apartment building on a hill overlooking town

375
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
Sonja trauss

376
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Who's suing the city of

377
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:05,215
And the other thing was a bill that would let the commuter rail system build big apartment buildings on land that it own

378
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
Towns near Trail station

379
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
DMVs wanted this bill Lafayette was

380
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Deposing

381
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
And I'm going to play you something

382
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,967
It's an audio recording of one moment at a hearing in Sacramento on this bill

383
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,527
Good morning Stephen Falk

384
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:23,647
I'm the Lafayette city manager representing the city of Lafayette at which is opposed to this bill

385
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,463
Thank you so Kate for being the representative

386
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
Of the city that is

387
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
Opposing all of this

388
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,375
Steve doesn't sound very like enthusiastically app

389
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,775
No it doesn't sound that enthusiastic because Steve fought personally really supported the bill he wants apartment

390
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
Buildings near that train station

391
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,127
That Renaissance you hear in his voice

392
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:50,527
Is because at that moment it was kind of a personal Crossroads for a cat sounds like he it was like a conflict between his paw

393
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,343
Personal beliefs and what he was required to do for him

394
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
Is job if it really was

395
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:59,743
And the first time you laid out the whole story publicly was just the other day when I met him at his home

396
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
I spoke against the bill

397
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Because I'm a

398
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
Professional city manager and I take Direction from

399
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,911
City Council

400
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
But I knew after that

401
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,103
I couldn't do this work anymore a few months later he announced he was resigning his position as manager of

402
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
The city of Lafayette

403
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
And this is because

404
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,199
The city manager of the city

405
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,783
Fighting the DMV's was secretly a yimby himself

406
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
What kind of

407
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,135
His motivation was slightly

408
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,999
The thing that makes him want more housing near public transportation is climate change

409
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
Because if people live close to trains

410
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
Less driving

411
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
Less burning fossil fuels

412
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,703
Analogy I'd use this I say

413
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
The house is on fire

414
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
Andar

415
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Children and art

416
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Grandchildren

417
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Are trapped in the Attic

418
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,919
And so what are we going to do about it

419
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
Well one thing you're going to do for

420
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,503
For sure is passed that law that makes

421
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
Good easier to build near the parts

422
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
It did pass by the way

423
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
And now that he's resigned you can say that out loud that he's

424
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Pleased with that

425
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,999
Well thank you so much Dan

426
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Thank you

427
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
Dancing with me here in the studio welcome

428
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,799
Is that how we're going to do this studio dance okay

429
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,895
Look I brought you in here cuz I'm about to lose my voice I've been talking

430
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Can too much

431
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Stand here with

432
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
What to eat

433
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
There's no whiskey in it yet

434
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
But

435
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
I brought you in here

436
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
To do a lightning rod

437
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,159
Because this is been quite a year

438
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
So much stuff is having so many updates

439
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,303
I have the paper here you found a bunch of episodes that we can update

440
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
Let's start with episode 8 6

441
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
T3 the 30

442
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
18th hole was a title

443
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
And this was your episode where you told the

444
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
The story of a celebrity golf tournament that

445
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
Kind of menorah

446
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
And it was for charity

447
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
Sponsored by the

448
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Trump found a

449
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,943
It was about how money for these kinds

450
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,711
Charity events

451
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,735
Doesn't always go to

452
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
To charity

453
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:03,647
Which is exactly why the New York attorney general's office has been investigating the Trump foundation for

454
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
But they put it quotes

455
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,719
Persistently illegal conduct

456
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Tumbbad yes

457
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
And just this month President Trump has

458
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,351
Agreed to shut down the whole Foundation

459
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
And give away the remaining money

460
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Panda lawsuit

461
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471

Food scare Squad

464
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
It was about the aftermath

465
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
Of last year's romaine lettuce contamination

466
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
And this year just

ForeKicks 2018 brought us another romaine lettuce

468
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
Almost exactly as it was

469
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Describe in Arabic

470
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Happened all over

471
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:39,487
But one thing has changed and that is that the lettuce is starting to be like

472
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
It has like a birth certificate

473
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:46,143
It says I was born in California or Arizona and so that means that if there is a

474
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
Food scare

475
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447

Can just threw out just the Arizona lettuce

478
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
And don't have to throw

479
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Baby steps

Small town in Georgia facing hard times does The Impossible

Saves Itself by putting on a musical theater show

485
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,695
Sadly this town was hit pretty hard by Hurricane Michael and they had to

486
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,999
Cancel a few of their shows it is back on

487
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023

488
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327

00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,567
Question hanging in the air

493
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
Lots of people fighting in about this one

494
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:34,271
Cookie jar they want to know what the cookie jar I honestly think I've never gotten more tweets on but this very issue which is that

495
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:38,623
Nick and I bought a cookie jar that looks like a cat for Stacey Vanek Smith

496
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,671
Everyone wanted to know if they see like

497
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,487
I am very sad to report that the

498
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Cookie jar broke

499
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Before we could give me

500
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791

Laws of the office

504
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,823
And this is how he helps a lot of people in writing in about

505
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
Erudition

506
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
Are they getting done in the sink

507
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:04,223
Remember Alice Evans professor of International Development

508
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527
Suggested that we get a giant trophy

509
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
To encourage people to

510
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
To do the dishes

511
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
An hour off

512
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
And we did

513
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
Like 4 feet tall

514
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,695
Golden bug on top

515
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,999
And when all the dishes were done in the sink

516
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
The trophy which is

517
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,327
Appear until a lot of you asked about the

518
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,399
The dish trophy mostly wanted to know if it worked so that they could use it

519
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
So

520
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
Knowing that I'm biased I asked

521
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
The expert on this

522
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
Okay Devon Miller our office

523
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,591
I'm dying to hear what

524
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,967
In your professional opinion do the trophy we put in the kitchen to make people do the dishes

525
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Work

526
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Yes

527
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,575
But I think it works

528
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,415
Because a couple individuals were more motivated to do dishes

529
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,231
Because someone told me it seemed passive-aggressive

530
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,327
An inaccurate description

531
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
Vanilla Sky

532
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Pinkalicious

533
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Gotten worse

534
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
I would agree with that

535
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
I don't think it had a lasting

536
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,055
Should we bring it back

537
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Totally

538
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,967
Okay I'm not surprised cuz he's right the dishes are not being done

539
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,783
Nxl 2019 trophy might come back

540
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
I hope so

541
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,087
One more update

542
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
More like office gossip all right

543
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,512
Episode is about episode 826 the Vodka proof

544
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,048
That one is where

545
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
We need our own homemade vodka

546
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,400
And then tested it against fancy vodka

547
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
How to prevent fancy. Guess I'll just marketing

548
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
Tru Sol

549
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,384
We forgot to use at our holiday party here at the NPR New York Bureau yes we had a cocktail competition between the

550
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
Teams at the bureau and four

551
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,968
Planet Money is entry

552
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
Translations

553
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,296
Spiral is what we called it

554
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,832
Nowhere near

555
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,672
But it's basically Jen and some of our homemade vodka

556
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
It tasted awful

557
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464

558
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
