Stacey Vanek Smith

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,320
Today we're going to replay one of our favorite episodes about immigration and

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,392
It's from a few years ago but it feels very relevant

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,696
Today and we will have an update

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
I must admit

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,792
I did not fully appreciate

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,560
How

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,840
Strange

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,632
More

16
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
Complicate

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,448
Unusual and weird

18
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,728
A good weird

19
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
Weird I do not appreciate how

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
Weird our immigration policy

21
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
Take for instance this fact

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,224
We have a cap on the number of people who can get a green card from each country

23
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
It is the same number for every kind

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,392
The number does not depend on the countryside which means

25
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,184
If you live in a tiny country

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,952
Luxembourg

27
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,280
Are plenty of open spots for you but

28
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,584
If you live in someplace bigger like India

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
Mexico

30
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
Be prepared to wait

31
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,960
Just because your country happens to have a lot of people

32
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:18,080
If you are a lower-skilled Mexican with a high school degree

33
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,920
And you have no family in the United States right now so you want to come in and work

34
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
There's virtually no way for you to do so

35
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
This is Economist Alex Norris.

36
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,880
If you are the lower-skilled Mexican you want to wait in line for that green card takes about 230 years

37
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,440
So

38
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,000
The notion that anybody can come here

39
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
And work

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Is false

41
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,864
Nobody can wait in line for 130 years obviously

42
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,168
Infected Mexico she just split in two

43
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
10 smaller country

44
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
It'll get 10 times as many slots

45
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
If you don't feel like waiting or splitting your country up

46
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
There are other routes

47
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
The United States

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
Better Call Saul

49
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
Like the one Anthony Court it took

50
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
When he fell in love with the United States

51
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
Or more specifically

52
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
MidFlorida

53
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,904
I was a barrister in the United Kingdom actually I should say England in Wales

54
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,720
We had a vacation home here in Florida

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,304
I say we might my wife and I and my two children

56
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,960
Are we came here frequently and each time we left the nice weather of Florida have a more and more depressed about having to leave

57
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,056
Does it get back to London and maybe all this rain and fog he hated it

58
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
Intercourse sound

59
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,384
Quick way to become a USC

60
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
I found this obscure program

61
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,504
The basically what you buy your way into the United

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
States

63
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
You just have to invest

64
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,600
Half million dollars in American Business

65
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,904
That is predicted to create

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
10 jobs

67
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
Just

68
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
Can jobs

69
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,816
Truthfully it looked too good to be true that it sounded to me it not time to be fanciful

70
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,144
So I did more research and realize that impact he was a genuine

71
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,752
Quarter cast out most of his savings invested in a Vermont

72
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Ski Resort

73
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
And he got his Visa

74
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
Now he's on his way to citizen

75
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,640
So there are exceptions for the rich

76
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
And it's not just the rich

77
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
There's plenty of exceptions but I'd lie

78
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,760
Depend on what your job is

79
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
Here's Economist Giovanni Peri

80
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:09,696
There are currently maybe more than 30 different categories of temporary visas

81
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,792
Weeden incredible detail

82
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:18,400
Who can come in on each there is one specific for

83
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
Models I'm sorry fashion models

84
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
Fashion model cs1 specifically for fashion models

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,848
Did you come to the US on a fashion model Visa

86
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:31,456
I tried but then I failed miserably

87
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,296
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm David kestenbaum and I am Robert Smith

88
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,160
There is for the first time in a while momentum building to try to change our immigration system

89
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,696
So today we ask

90
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
What would be the perfect two

91
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
We could scrap the mess that we have right now

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
What would be best for our economy

93
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,984
We have three people who have thought a lot about this and we got three answers for what their dreams were

94
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
Three big ideas

95
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
I could fix the system support for Planet Money and the following message

96
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,504
Come from betterment a smarter way to invest your money

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,904
Betterment combine time-tested investing principles with the transparency and ease-of-use you expect

98
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
Great technology

99
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,744
Focusing on lowering fees and taxes

100
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
And here's what you might find refreshing

101
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,447
Betterment really cares that you reach your financial goals and that's why they keep their fees low

102

The more information visit betterment.com Planet Money

104
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
Okay our first idea to reform immigration

105
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
I'm going to give you

106
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
Okay this one is

107
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,855
The best and the brightest

108
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,231
This idea comes from Dean Baker he is co-director of the center for economic

109
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
Can policy research

110
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
Identified himself as being left us

111
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,167
Baker's dream system would be a lot simpler than the one we laid out at the beginning of the program

112
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
You start by picking the number of people you were going to let

113
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
The total number

114
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,311
So say a million and a half

115
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
For 2 million a year

116
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Show me more than we let in now

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,943
Then you just got to decide who gets the car

118
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
Baker says

119
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,319
Of course he would like people to be able to reunite with their families bring their relatives

120
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
But after that

121
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
He wants to give up visas preferentially to the

122
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
The people who would benefit the economy the most

123
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Scientist

124
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Engineers

125
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
Lawyers computer programmers

126
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,399
I would like to make sure that you had a lot of them going to the high-end

127
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
Just a little unfair it's basically

128
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Saying you know

129
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,823
You can only come in and have a much better chance coming in if you have a graduate degree if your

130
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Someone who

131
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Are you bleed

132
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Really

133
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
Need the money more

134
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Is less chance

135
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,575
Well you might say that but but in terms of

136
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
You know

137
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
Certiport World Justice

138
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,719
Realistically we're going to let a tiny tiny number of people from the rest

139
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
The world into the United

140
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
States

141
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,839
So I don't have much qualms about saying okay who are those going to be

142
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Those are going to be

143
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:03,007
Workers with high education high qualifications and then I'd like to repatriate a portion of their earnings

144
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,359
So that will benefit their home countries as well so if we get a doctor from India

145
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,199
Take 10% of their earnings when they're here for their first 10 or 15 years

146
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:16,063
Use that to train two or three more doctors in India so maybe actually ends up with better Healthcare

147
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
As a result of doctors emigrating to United States

148
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Thai we would require that

149
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
That's you you gave me the choice to design my dream system yes I'd like to see ensure that India benefits from that's

150
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
Story as well

151
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
So you would say

152
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,471
The doctor you came here we're going to tax you

153
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,591
10% of your earnings I don't have to come if you know the reality is again the differences in wages

154
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
They're so large that if you have a doctor come to

155
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
The United States

156
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
And 10%

157
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
Are there income off the top

158
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,575
Is taxed away and then sent back to to India to educate more doctors

159
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,671
It's still end up way ahead and again you know if they're not happy about it they don't have to come here

160
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
What about Farm Workers

161
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:03,167
You know I'm less concerned about farmworkers I mean I know there's a lot of farmers who say that you know they couldn't operate their Farm

162
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
Low-cost labor and

163
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:11,359
You know I'd say that a lot of those Farms crab shouldn't be operating I'm not really troubled by the idea that farmer should have to pay

164
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,199
Hey the same sort of wages to attract people as retail stores or anyone else

165
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
I don't really see a problem with that I don't think we need a special underclass of people to work at real low wages in the Farms I I don't think

166
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
That makes sense

167
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,183
Can you say what say we put in the system

168
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
And a picture of

169
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
How's life in United States

170
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
All in with there doctors on every corner

171
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
They're dead they're everywhere

172
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,287
We're going to be surrounded by doctors setting up a shop and every corner undercutting each other and prices

173
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,127
I think we would see Laura lower-cost Healthcare and that's obviously something

174
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
I think everyone has to

175
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,175
Concerned about cuz

176
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
You know we know

177
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,343
In terms of healthcare insurance whether paying out-of-pocket and certainly is a government category government spending it

178
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
Most rapidly Rising category government spending

179
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,999
So they can have a very positive impact in terms of lowering healthcare costs

180
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,143
On the other hand a lot of the types of Labor that you know we currently get very cheap would cost more

181
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
People work

182
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
Hainan hotels

183
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
Housekeeper

184
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
Wednesday would be getting higher wages

185
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Pizza restaurant

186
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
The people working in the kitchen

187
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
A custodian

188
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,175
Can Office Buildings all these people would be getting more money

189
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,991
Which would mean higher costs so we probably see things

190
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
Pure restaurant

191
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
You know we got a restaurant in my Costas you know

192
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
23% more for a male witch

193
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
Most of us would go out somewhat less

194
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,767
So what we see is that a lot of the goods that are relatively

195
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Cheap today

196
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,095
Would be somewhat more expensive waresley some of the

197
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
Bartley Healthcare wood

198
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
Is a Chrysler expensive

199
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
Would cost us less

200
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Today

201
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
ID number one

202
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,311
We should point out that Dean Baker is far from alone

203
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
In wanting to let in more High School

204
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,431
The Chicago Booth School of Business does he surveys

205
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
A panel of expert economy

206
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
List of all stripes

207
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,039
What are the survey questions was

208
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
Would average US citizen

209
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Be better off

210
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
If we let more highly educated

211
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Kid workers in Agra

212
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
A38 economist

213
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
When did not

214
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Respond

215
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
One said he was uncertain

216
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
All the others are

217
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
Let more professional

218
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
Now we should say there is a challenge

219
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,519
Which is but it still depends on the government picking who gets in and who doesn't

220
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
So you say professionals but

221
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Which profession

222
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,639
How do you decide what is our economy mean

223
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,991
Funny people lobbying fashion model the supermodels are going to want to get in

224
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,295
To our second economist

225
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
He has what he thinks

226
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
Is a better way

227
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Immigration ID number 2

228
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
The highest bidder

229
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
My name is Giovanni Peri

230
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
I am professor of economics

231
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Except universe

232
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
California

233
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,423
Jovani is the guy who told us about the special category for admitting

234
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
He says the best way to figure out

235
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
Who to let in

236
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
Is that you auction your visas off

237
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
To the highest bidder

238
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,687
Whoever employer is willing to pay more is going to

239
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
Get the permit to hire

240
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,319
So if we need if it turns out we do need more fashion models or more doctors

241
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
Presumably those employers would be willing to.

242
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
To pay more and they would get

243
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
Absolutely yes indeed

244
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
Real location

245
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,071
All of this worker is not determined by the government

246
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,167
Gruesome gruesome numbers that they come up

247
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
Where the body is determined by the market

248
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,031
You can imagine that under the system there would not be a whole lot of

249
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
People coming into work on farms or work on

250
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Construction site

251
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
It's hard to imagine some

252
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,687
Tomato Farmers trying to hire that worker

253
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
Outbidding Microsoft

254
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Visa

255
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:35,647
I'm like with Jean Baker I mean Giovanni is worried about the situation to his idea is that you have to

256
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
Categories of Visa

257
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,255
One for high-skilled workers that would be an option there

258
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,607
And one for low-skilled workers separate auction in each category would find the right

259
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Price for their workers

260
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
I think he's another very important point.

261
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,799
I don't know if I want to give some numbers numbers

262
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:58,431
We say probably in high-skilled a permit for 3-year window between 5 and $10,000

263
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,503
And it looks skip permit which is only one here right now

264
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,903
Off for these temporary worker we go probably between 1 and $2,000

265
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,231
The math he comes up with a figure of maybe a billion dollars

266
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
The US government can make off of oxygen

267
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
A lot of money

268
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
And you know when you hear people talk about immigration

269
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
There's all this

270
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,751
Language around Edina moving to America to live the American dream

271
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,335
The Economist we talked to they did not make a huge deal about this citizenship

272
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,895
The auction Giovanni's talking about would be for

273
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,199
Temporary work visas good for a year

274
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
A few years

275
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,271
He says if things work out on the job

276
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
And they're still here when time is up

277
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
We should let him stay

278
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Become citizens

279
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
We got two options so far

280
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
1

281
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,255
Allocate visas preferentially the high-skilled workers

282
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Or two

283
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
Auction them off

284
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
Let businesses decide

285
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
Who they needed what they're willing to pay for the Visa

286
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Or

287
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Or you

288
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
You could go with dream proposal number 3

289
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
Robert weekly miss one

290
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
The free-for-all

291
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,127
This one comes from Alex Nebraska a self-described Libertarian at the

292
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
The Cato Institute

293
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
Here's his proposal

294
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Letterman

295
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
All of them

296
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:10,367
The dream set up my drum set up would be a system whereby only criminals

297
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
Suspected terrorists

298
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,767
And those with serious communicable diseases like you know drug-resistant tuberculosis

299
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
Are barred from coming to the United States

300
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
To live and work

301
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
It's pretty simple

302
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
Everyone who wants to come to America

303
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Just show up at the border

304
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
Thought-forms background check

305
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
And boom

306
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
You're in

307
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
Not as crazy

308
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,919
Are the United States had a system like that

309
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,759
From roughly 1792 about 1882

310
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Did you catch that

311
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,087
He's saying that this crazy system

312
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
Open borders

313
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,671
That was the law of the land for almost

314
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
100 Years of American history

315
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,071
Damn the crazy system is the system that we have now with all these restrictions

316
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
That's crazy

317
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,423
It wasn't put in place because of logic or fairness

318
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
It was put in place because

319
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Racism

320
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
In particular fear of people from China

321
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,407
We're coming in and providing cheap labor working the Goldrush building Railroad

322
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
And the Chinese word convenient scapegoat

323
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,271
They look very different from Americans at that time

324
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,087
So is easy to point them as being you know difference

325
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
And third of all

326
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
A severe economic

327
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Right to be nice

328
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
After the Chinese

329
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
We start the black European in a

330
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Change the Lost Immigrants had to

331
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Parts of Europe

332
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
And had have family here

333
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
This dynamic

334
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
Where we exclude groups of people this

335
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
Can you over the last hundred years

336
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
That's why they end up like this

337
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
Certain groups were afraid

338
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Other groups would come in

339
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
And take away their job

340
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
Eventually ended up with the messy system we have today

341
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,991
Alex's argument

342
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
Or basically opening the borders is pretty

343
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
The more people he says the better

344
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,927
People immigrated to the United States they tend to work really hard

345
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
They're more likely to start up businesses

346
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
Sergey Brin the co-founder of Google

347
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
He was rushing

348
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
And if you Google

349
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
Immigrant entrepreneurs you find out

350
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
The Intel co-founded by Hungarian

351
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
EBay founded

352
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
French Yahoo by the Taiwanese

353
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Loving a post by a Greek woman

354
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,407
Tok more immigrants means more entrepreneurs more doctors more compete

355
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Programmer

356
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
Teachers Ma

357
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
More radio

358
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,831
Alex you probably can't tell from his accent but Roberts from Canada

359
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Welcome

360
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:25,023
Because your country is strange to me but I I'm I'm getting along well and working hard

361
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,655
Assimilating very well I must say I mean if we let in

362
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,495
All the brilliant Canadian radio reporters and there are a lot of them

363
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,799
They could take my job or you know I can recover

364
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
I can get a big salary cut

365
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,711
I know competition is good but it is stressful if I think about it first choice

366
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:49,087
Alex told us yes looking some places this competition it could depress wages

367
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
But he figures it won't actually be too bad

368
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Because

369
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
He said a lot of what happened

370
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
When you let a bunch of people in

371
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,047
Is it the economy just expands to accommodate them

372
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
Spell little

373
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,679
Immigration is more than stealing Talent from other countries

374
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,751
It's about allowing people to come to a place where they can

375
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
Flourish where they can in fact do more for the world

376
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
What's a transfer of somebody

377
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,151
Who are the less productive in their home country

378
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
2

379
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
The United States

380
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,039
What are three to five to ten times more productive

381
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:25,695
So what increases the size of the global pie the global economic pie tremendously as well as the pie in the United States

382
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
Which makes sense to me we have electricity here we have

383
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:33,631
Function court system we have law enforcement we have financial markets so you can get your business going

384
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Silicon Valley

385
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
When people come here he says

386
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
It benefits them

387
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
But it also helps everybody else

388
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
Alex's proposal does have this one very nice

389
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,175
Feature which is that yes you have to scream at criminals and terrorists at the border

390
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
But you don't have all these undocumented immigrant

391
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,807
The danger of them crossing the border in the middle of the night

392
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
I'm living here

393
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
In fear

394
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
You don't need so many immigration poll

395
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
All that goes away

396
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,023
We're at Alex's idea of open borders by are two other economist

397
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
And both of them had the same

398
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Too many

399
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Too many people would want to

400
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Christine Baker

401
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:14,079
What's that funny I was at a conference remember some years back and there were few people that they weren't all Economist there but a few people

402
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
I said what would happen if we open the borders and

403
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,479
All of the people who were there from developing countries just laughed and they said

404
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
Why don't you do it for a few years and see

405
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
Get out the reality is obviously United States is a much wealthier country than say sub-Saharan Africa Bangla

406
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:34,815
4 - if you had open borders you just said what do you want to come here come here you know you can work just like anyone else

407
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
My guess is you would see a massive

408
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
I mean tens of Millions

409
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
The people

410
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Find

411
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,007
I don't think a lot of people would really be happy with that outcome

412
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
I'm going to be very different

413
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
Country Inn and not just talking about complexion

414
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
I'm done talking about yellow sheer numbers of pi

415
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
People

416
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
Strength and infrastructure that

417
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
Strains on the natural environment

418
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,903
I don't think you know what country is 310-320 million people I don't think people really be that anxious to see the

419
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
The US is a country or six or seven

420
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
Hundred million people and say it

421
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
10 15 20

422
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,839
We kept asking Alex about this if you open the borders

423
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,399
How many people would come here

424
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,703
Alex says there are some poles

425
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Where they asked people around the world

426
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,799
You want to move to the United States

427
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
There were a lot of guests

428
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,895
I was about five to seven hundred million

429
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
So that would

430
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503
That would more than double triple the US population

431
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
That would

432
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:30,623
But you know we have to take Graham saw a grand at Big R and salt with that

433
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,719
Because you know it's very easy for people to say they want to move

434
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:40,351
One of the main features of modern migration around the world is that a lot of people move temporarily for a couple years

435
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
And they move back to their home

436
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
Alex figures more like

437
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
50 to 100 million

438
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
People that want to move

439
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
Can you think

440
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
You can handle that

441
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,871
America is comparatively underpopulated compared to a lot of other kind

442
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
I mean compared to Western European countries in East Asian countries

443
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
America has a lot of space lot of room to build

444
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
What chances do you give this passing in Congress

445
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
About 0

446
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,463
How do you add the type of thing that I want right now is somewhere near to zero

447
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
There you have it

448
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,279
Three Economist three proposals

449
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
Each one more unlikely than the

450
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,887
But not impossible
