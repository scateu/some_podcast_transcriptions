1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,352
Late last year President Trump was making very strong statement

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,400
About what the Federal Reserve

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,448
Or more specifically what the Fed

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,472
Should not

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,800
She did not want the FED to raise interest rates

6
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,408
Write the day before the FED Med in December the president tweeted that it was in

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:22,272
Credible that quotes the state is even considering yet another interest rate hike

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,808
Then the next day

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,136
He warned the FED not to quote make yet another mistake

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416
Presidents

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,440
Lovelo in

12
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
Because

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,792
They make it easy for people to borrow money to buy stuff

14
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,864
And for businesses to borrow and hire people but

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
Low interest rates

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,912
Also dry

17
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
Drive up inflation

18
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,240
Part of the federal reserve's job

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
Is to keep inflation

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,824
The day after Trump's

21
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,640
Fed chair Jerome Powell who was

22
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,432
Appointed by President Trump

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,016
Announced that the FED had in fact raised

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,600
He did the opposite of what the president wanted him to do

25
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,160
The Federal Reserve is ended

26
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
And this is a phrase you will hear

27
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,976
Fed into pain

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
What happened in December

29
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
President saying

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
Don't raise rates

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
And is Fed chair saying

32
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
We raise rates

33
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,936
That's fed Independence

34
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,008
There is a story of how fed Independence

35
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
Came to be and

36
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,568
A specific

37
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,384
Day that I am henceforth going to call

38
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664

And how it had to

46
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280

Okay fed Independence Day as I'm calling it

61
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,824
Is because of what happened in this country

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
On March 4th

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
1950

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,016
In the years before 1951 the FED took orders from the treasury basically from the

65
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,368
We were fighting World War II and so when the president said to the Fed chair

66
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,512
You better set interest rate so it's cheap for the government to borrow money to pay for the war the FED said yeah okay

67
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,328
But after the war inflation started Rising

68
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
And the Fed chair said to the Press

69
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,448
It is our job to deal with inflation

70
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
You need to let us raise interest rate

71
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
President Truman

72
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Sed

73
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,664
And by early 1951 inflation had hit 21%

74
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,992
The price of everything that Americans bought was Rising by

75
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
21% a year

76
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,112
So Truman finally gave in on March 4th 1951

77
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,928
His Treasury Department agreed to leave the FED alone

78
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
The FED not the president

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
Would set interest rates for the

80
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
The Fed was free

81
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
Sort of

82
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,376
Yeah this agreement was known as the

83
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
Treasury fed Accord

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,520
And the treasury set a cord is not a law or even an official rule

85
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
This really was just a handshake deal

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
The president

87
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
At that moment

88
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
With a green to not mess with the Fed

89
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
The real test

90
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,504
It would come when another president came in

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
And decided

92
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
I don't like this agreement

93
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,512
I just wanted to thank you for your most of the thoughtful and generous letter and I appreciate it so much and

94
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,144
This is President Lyndon B Johnson and this phone call happened just a few days after Johnson became president in nineteen

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Pick 3

96
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,984
Which was just a few days after John F Kennedy was assassinated

97
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
Johnson had been thrown into off

98
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,872
And so he started checking in with all the important people

99
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,688
And it's called he is introducing himself

100
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
Fed chair William mcchesney

101
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,040
What time saying in this call is

102
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
You're the ex

103
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,904
Oxford I'm here to listen

104
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
Make it back to the shop and then he start to tell me what I want to know about it

105
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
Well I certainly will happen every way that I can make you a picture then I'm glad you around and

106
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
As far as We Know

107
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,007
This is the first call between President Johnson and chairman Martin

108
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Sounds cordial

109
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
But their relationship would deteriorate

110
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
Spectacular

111
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,711
Obama why don't we just want to start by having you introduce

112
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,367
Sure I'm Bob Runner by author of the book on William mcchesney Martin I have kind of the corner on William Machesney Mall

113
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
Book out there

114
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,511
Bob's going to be our guide through the Lyndon B Johnson William mcchesney Martin story

115
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
So here goes

116
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
Johnson and Martin were too varied

117
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Different types of

118
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:59,263
Johnson was this tall imposing guy race in Texas

119
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
Being a manipulator

120
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
He remembered slights he exchange favors

121
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
Any play them like fiddle

122
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
He was a man who did all the things

123
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
To get people to do

124
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
What he wanted

125
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
That's correct

126
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Bill Martin wasn't like that

127
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,647
A journalist once called him the happy

128
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
Puritan his father was in banking

129
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,279
Martin looks like a banker he was skinny he had rimless glasses

130
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:26,143
Later on in his life he became friends and Tennis partners with that biographer table runner

131
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
Did Bill Martin ever tell you any jokes

132
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Hey jokes

133
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,799
You know not a joke teller and I remember

134
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
Finding

135
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Annies papers

136
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
Saying humor

137
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
And it didn't have anything in it

138
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,295
Honest-to-god

139
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Well

140
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
Is it true

141
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,671
That William mcchesney Martin

142
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
Love more than anything in the world

143
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,071
Trying to explain the Federal Reserve to people absolutely absolutely

144
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,911
What were some of the analogies or metaphors he

145
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
Parrot

146
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Probably the most famous

147
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
Was his comment

148
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
That

149
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
How the federal reserve's role

150
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Was really

151
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
To take the punch bowl away

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
Just as the party got going

153
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,015
The punch bowl analogy

154
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,831
Business journalists use this all the time

155
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
Time and the idea

156
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,439
Is low interest rates are like the booze out of

157
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,535
It in the feds job is to be the responsible adult

158
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
Raise interest rate

159
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,655
Take the punch bowl away before the party gets out of

160
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
Before inflation starts

161
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,567
To take off okay so when Lyndon Johnson becomes President Bill Martin was already the Fed chair

162
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,943
And one of the first things that Johnson does is to push a big package of tax cuts at Kennedy have been working

163
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,551
Johnson told Congress that passing these Cuts was a way to honor Kennedy

164
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
And it works because pass

165
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
And then there were

166
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
The two Wars

167
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
Johnson inherited the Vietnam War from Kennedy and then

168
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
He got us in D

169
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,559
Fever and at home Johnson launched the war on poverty

170
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
This is where Medicare and Medicaid

171
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
And tons of other social

172
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
Rapso

173
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
These two Wars

174
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Were expensive

175
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,823
Because of all this government spending a lot of money was heating up the US economy

176
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,943
Plus people are getting these tax break so it's getting even hotter this is great for Johnson because

177
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,015
Cuz people are happy and Johnson wants eventually to be re-elected

178
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
But

179
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,087
William mcchesney Martin is watching

180
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
And thinking

181
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,975
This is the kind of stuff the FED needs to pay very close at

182
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
Because

183
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
This kind of spending could very likely lead to

184
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
So he starts warning Johnson

185
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,983
We are in serious trouble I think the FED is going to need to raise in

186
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
We are headed for

187
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Quote

188
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
An inflationary map

189
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,639
And Johnson is like yeah well I talk to other smart

190
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
People

191
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
Quote they don't agree with you

192
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,991
This is the classic fight

193
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
The FED wants to raise interest rates be

194
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
Worried about the

195
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
Economy in the long run

196
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,159
And the president wants low interest rates

197
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
Because they are good

198
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
For the economy

199
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
The stage was set

200
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Fours problem

201
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,375
So the question is what kind of effect Sherman do and what's in them

202
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
What did Martin do to try to

203
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
To Telegraph the feds in town

204
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
And the concerns the FED has

205
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
So the one thing they can do is give

206
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,431
So we have a frustrated Fed chair

207
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,271
And if it happens he gets an elegantly timed invitation

208
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
Which leads to as far as we can tell

209
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
The worst

210
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
Commencement day speech in history

211
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
Yeah Bill Martin gets invited

212
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
To Columbia University to speak

213
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,815
At the graduation day luncheon

214
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
So you can imagine camp

215
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,679
Buzzing with bright eyed kids in powder blue caps

216
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Townsend

217
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
You know how commencement date speech

218
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
She's usually sound they're all

219
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
Oh the Places You'll Go

220
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
That is not what Martin.

221
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,711
No he starts his address not by saying follow your dreams or some such

222
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
She says

223
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
When economic prospects are at their brightest

224
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,367
The dangers of complacency and recklessness

225
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Are great

226
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,463
And then he UPS the ante by saying

227
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,279
We find disquieting similarity

228
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
Between our present prosperity

229
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
And the fabulous 20

230
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,959
And here is here's a Federal Reserve chairman

231
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
Talking about

232
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,287
You know we are in a situation today

233
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
That is

234
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
Very much

235
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Like there

236
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Situation

237
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
That led to the Great Depression

238
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
What

239
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
That's pretty tough stuff

240
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
What is he saying

241
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
What is he saying to these kids exactly like

242
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
We're

243
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
If we're not careful

244
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
He's now he's really speaking.

245
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
That's the problem

246
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
For the kids

247
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
This moment where the Fed chair is actually saying the words

248
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Danger signal

249
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,287
And Great Depression in the same speech

250
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,591
Makes the front page of the New York Times today

251
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
The stock market

252
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
And when President Johnson gets word of this

253
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
He is deceiving

254
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
He asked his attorney general

255
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
Can I fire this guy

256
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,367
Attorney general disappointed him by saying

257
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
There's no way you can

258
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Unseat him

259
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
Except

260
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
For cause

261
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
And unfortunately

262
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
Policy differences do not constitute cause

263
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
Summers president you're stuck with

264
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
Kyla Johnson that must have been

265
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Havasu Chase

266
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Oh well I mean

267
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
Nobody told Linda John

268
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
Nobody

269
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
Think about this now from Johnson's point of view

270
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:30,271
William mcchesney Martin and the FED have an enormous amount of power

271
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,111
They get to decide how much it's going to cost to get a mortgage or student loan

272
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
A handful of

273
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,975
Technocrats in the Federal Reserve get to make those decisions

274
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
Not me

275
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
The president of the United States

276
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
Who is the representative of

277
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
All the people

278
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,703
And to be fair some people today feel exactly the same way

279
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
Why do these unelected

280
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
Technocrats get so much power

281
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
So after Bill Martin's Columbia

282
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Johnson

283
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:56,895
Furious

284
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
He gets on the phone and start stalking

285
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,759
All about is Fed chair about Bill freaking Martin

286
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
Hi Joe how are you

287
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,903
You'll hear Johnson in this call saying like

288
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,951
I can't control Bill Martin

289
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
He has

290
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Control of the ball

291
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
I've met with him half a dozen time

292
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Can't do anything

293
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,423
But I'm doing everything you know how that's is Martin half-dozen times

294
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
I have to get control at Ford

295
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,031
He's got control of it

296
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,567
So Johnson is live

297
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
But

298
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
He's starting to understand that Martin

299
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
He's going to do this is going to raise the

300
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
So instead of begging Martin not to

301
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
KeyBank Martin

302
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
Wait until

303
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
Johnson can pass a budget

304
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
In the news

305
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Big priority

306
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,719
This is all happening in the fall of nineteen

307
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
65

308
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,327
And Johnson slips into full manipulator mode

309
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
He's about to have surgery

310
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Any even tries to use that as Leverage

311
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,007
Johnson was going in to have his gallbladder taken out and

312
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:01,407
And he said you wouldn't raise rates on me would you be a while I'm in the hospital and Martin said oh no mr. president will wait until you

313
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,991
You're out so Martin does wait but he doesn't wait long

314
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,599
On December 3rd Martins fed takes a vote on whether to raise the interest rate by half a per

315
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
Percent and they vote to do it

316
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
Johnson is at his Texas ranch

317
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
Recovering from surgery

318
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
When he finds out

319
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
What Martin

320
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
We can't control him

321
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,631
He's worked as hard as he can he's threatened

322
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,935
And yes Martin is gone and done this

323
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,751
And he can't believe it's a Johnson summons Martin

324
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
To the ranch

325
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
Martin flies down

326
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
Is Call of Duty Johnson's office

327
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
We don't know exactly what was said

328
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
In that off

329
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Here is Bob Brenner

330
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
And Johnson is just

331
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
Fit to be tied

332
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Start right off

333
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Found

334
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,511
No this is this is something that can affect my entire term

335
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,351
You knew that this would have this impact on me

336
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,703
And yet you went right ahead and you ran a Rapier right through me

337
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
You and

338
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,567
Federal Reserve had put yourself above my presidency

339
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
And you

340
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,407
Totally disregard my wishes in my policy

341
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,967
The Despicable thing to do

342
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
And then

343
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
There is

344
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
A reference

345
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,391
To the fact that the Johnson was so angry that he pushed Martin against the wall

346
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,231
Physically pushed him against the wall actually pushed him against

347
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
The president of the United States

348
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
Yes laid hands on

349
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
Yes he is Fed chair

350
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
Well Martin says

351
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Mr. president

352
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
We have not but

353
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Ourselves

354
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
Over your presidency

355
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
I told you I was going to do this

356
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
I told you personally

357
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
I told you Administration

358
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
That we were going to do this

359
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,063
I've given you a lot of Advance note

360
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
But I do have

361
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,903
The very strong conviction

362
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,951
The Federal Reserve Act

363
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,535
Place the responsibility for interest rates with the Federal Reserve board

364
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,375
This is one of those few occasions where the Federal Reserve

365
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Decision

366
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Has to be final

367
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
This is a huge

368
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
Moment and here's why

369
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,847
Remember fed Independence Day March 4th 1951

370
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,199
That treasury fed Accord was really just a handshake deal

371
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,527
This moment tested the handshake deal

372
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,367
William mcchesney Martin is standing up to Lyndon B Johnson and saying

373
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,671
No disagreement is real

374
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,255
The FED is not going to be bullied into doing what the president wants

375
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
I mean if you want

376
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
One single moment

377
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
When the Federal Reserve

378
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,495
Defined its independence and what that meant

379
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
To somebody who was out to

380
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
To squash it is much

381
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Just possible

382
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
That's it

383
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,223
The thing about fate Independence Day is that it's really not just one day

384
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,039
There's the treasury fed Accord the 4th of March

385
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,647
There's the day Johnson shoved Martin for acting independently the 6th of December

386
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,719
Any didn't stop there after Martin left the Fed

387
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,023
Inflation started going way up

388
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,119
Until another Fed chair Paul volcker had to assert fed Independence

389
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Again

390
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:06,495
Erase interest rates even though farmers were blockading the FED with their tractors

391
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,823
And then in a smaller way we saw this again in December

392
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
When the president of the United

393
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,711
State sort of Warrant his Fed chair Jerome Powell on Twitter

394
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
Not to raise interest rates

395
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
And Powell in the Fed

396
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Did it anyway

397
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
It may sound like we're saying

398
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
Maybe every day

399
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Is fetid

400
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:30,047
But no it is the 4th of March and after the break I have some very serious thoughts about how to celebrate

401
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,863
He does dragon want to stick around until after the credits

402
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,751

413
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:14,335

414
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615

Read the Declaration

417
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
It's on the air with

418
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503

Forfeit Independence Day

421
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,999
We should be reading the treasury fed Accord the the FED coloration of independent if you will now

422
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,583
But I do think we should

423
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,679
Go get the old document that was released on March 4th

424
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
19th

425
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
51 announcing the treasury fedak

426
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,079
And I think what we should do is we should get the other host and

427
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Get that sweet music

428
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
And have them read this NPR

429
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,943
Alright I'm in let's do it

430
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:58,623

00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,463
The treasury and the Federal Reserve System

432
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Have reached

00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,303
Full Accord with respect to debt

434
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Manage my

435
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,679
And monetary policies to be pursued in furthering their common purpose

436
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,751
Assure the successful financing of a government

437
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,055
Requirements and the same time

438
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,847
To minimize monetization

439
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
The public

440
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,663
That's it

441
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
It's one setting

442
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503
Kind of confusing he was basically a press release

443
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,063
I am going to propose that henceforth

444
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
We shall read

445
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
