00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,952
The story of how Tommy started fighting fake reviews

78
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
Begin Sivan 2006

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
Tommy was in college

80
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,072
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the

81
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
What time is 90

82
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,192
It was a bit of a gym rat that is Peak he could bench-press around 200

83
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
40 lb

84

Monday

85
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Tommy was hanging out with

86
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,128
The friend money says hey do you want the rest of this pre-workout pre-workout it's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed

87
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
To take before you

88
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:01,248
I just gives you crazy energy and you can lift more and longer and harder

89
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,296
You know at least those are the claim

90
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,600
Just to be clear this is not a steroid

91
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
In case that's what you're saying

92
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Tommy's very against

93
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
Anyways

94
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
Tommy's friend

ASA Tommy

97
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
I paid 60 bucks for it

98
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,424
And it gives me such bad stomach issues that I

99
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
It's ruining my workouts

100
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Counter product

101
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,592
If you're not familiar with the supplement world it's not the most tightly regulated

102
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
And on top of that back in

103
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
In 2006

104
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
More and more folks were starting to buy

105
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Online like

106
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:38,368
Supplements to gears my head started turning and I started looking up supplementreviews and I couldn't find anything that was

107
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,184
But yet I mean I was all just written by the manufacturer they could

108
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,464
Amazon opportunity

109
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
He could build an online review side

110
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,144
What bodybuilders give honest feedback about the supplements they're putting into their bodies

111
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,448
And so Tommy got to work he taught himself some

112
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,264
Computer coding and he created what he would eventually call

113
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800

00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
The product but have proof that it works

193
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
Keith

194
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
I absolutely enjoy the taste

195
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Especially

196
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,767
Grape I also really enjoyed the unflavored and the tropical Finland

197
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
Almost reads like a sales pitch

198
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,935
Any kind of read it and you think all right was it a wrap that wrote this or was it someone that just

199
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,495
Drank the Kool-Aid of the marketing campaign

200
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
I never get bloated from it

201
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
Despite it sometimes take two times as much

202
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
Is the serving during a nap

203
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
My workout

204
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,967
Believe the hype is a spot a truly deliver the pain with a promises

205
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
The taste of it is very good as well as mixed crop

206
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,111
Super Tommy these kinds of reviews were sometimes hard to deal with because

207
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,463
It sounded like a person from the company just come in and written this but

208
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,047
What if it was someone who had tried the product and really did believe the hype

209
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,863
And that's the problem with online reviews in a nutshell

210
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,471
It's almost impossible to tell from the continent alone if the reviews fake or not

211
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
But Tommy new

212
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,103
If a company was coming in and pretending to be a regular bodybuilder who

213
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
Happen to love their product

214
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,943
The entire idea of his website

215
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
Would fall apart so I would really have to do a bunch of investigative work on each one to really see where it originated in weather

216
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Whether it was from the company or not

217
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,183
So Tommy goes to work

218
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,767
Basically the first thing I check out is the email address that they used

219
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
To register for the site

220
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
Company email address

221
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
That happens sometime

222
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Yes

223
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,055
It didn't take Tommy long to realize that these companies were coming in

224
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
And basically there were just writing press releases

225
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
Fake reviews

226
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
The flooding in

227
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
And starting to overwhelm the real reviews

228
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,599
And I just thought it's not fair that you know people that actually leave feedback that is

229
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,415
Real honest are getting silence

230
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
Tommy took all this time and created the

231
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Displays for honest

232
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
Speed bag

233
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
And that was just being

234
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
Turns into the exact opposite

235
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Yeah

236
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,191
Yeah well it's might you know it was my work as my life's work and

237
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,311
It's painful to see somebody just disrespected like that in the name of of money

238
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
Tommy site

239
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Pretty small site

240
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
Starting to wonder like if this is happening

241
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
To supplement reviews.com

242
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
I wonder how big of a problem this is

243
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Another site

244
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
So you went into the belly of the Beast of online shopping

245
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
Amazon.com

246
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,487
And I looked at this testosterone booster that had

247
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
560 reviews

248
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
It was actually 580 River

249
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,887
Tommy starts to scan through a little bit

250
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,471
And he speaks review Spidey senses are going bonkers

251
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,263
And he's like okay

252
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,823
I'm going to inspect every single one of

253
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
It's going to be a lot of work

254
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
And imma need my special Pandora station

255
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,503
For this based off of a song from

256
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
I call him Deadmau5 but the other people call him Deadmau5 it's called take care of the proper paperwork is

257
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
What's the name of this song

258
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
This certainly must be in the top 10

259
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,167
Songs named after paperwork don't you think

260
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,959
Is that is pretty accurate

261
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,543
So Tommy is going through every single review

262
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
And essentially asking

263
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
How do I know I can trust

264
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,943
I've got an Excel spreadsheet open and I got

265
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:27,551
Amazon and I've got like 500 tabs open on Amazon and I'm sitting there just

266
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:32,927
Look at the next review tally updated look at the next of your tally up to

267
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Online fake

268
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Some of them

269
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
Or not so tricky for example

270
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,351
One review he noticed there was a before and after

271
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
Skinny guy after

272
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Super ripped

273
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
Tommy does a reverse image search

274
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:48,799
And he finds the earliest example of a photo on Reddit

275
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:54,175
And I messaged that user on Reddit and I said hey did you also use this image for a review

276
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
And I said no no no

277
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,039
Busted a stolen before and after

278
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Obviously

279
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Play fake

280
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,903
As he investigates Tommy's also starting to notice that

281
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
Some suspicious reviewers have almost like an

282
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
An mov

283
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
But he can identify

284
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,327
Didn't you start naming these different types of question

285
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Snowball reviewer

286
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,911
One category of the brand monogamous

287
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,751
These are people that only review products

288
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
From one company

289
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Over

290
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
And over again

291
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,175
Sure maybe that person really likes that company or

292
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Maybe that person works for that

293
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
Another fake reviewer profile

294
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
The one hit wonders

295
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,087
These are people who review

296
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
One thing

297
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
And then

298
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
Never review anything

299
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
I mean obviously there are people that just review one thing

300
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
That's

301
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,327
Totally up a normal thing that happens but if it happens a lot and if

302
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,423
Those one hit wonders are giving the product of 5 * across-the-board then

303
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,543
You know again maybe there's something unnatural about that like if it's testosterone booster had

304
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
A bunch of one hit wonders that were all really positive

305
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,895
That is pretty

306
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
But the most unnatural

307
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Retro pattern Tommy

308
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
Was this suspicious flood of

309
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
Have positive reviews around the exact same

310
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:10,463
Yeah it was like three days of you know this super high volume where I think like

311
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
30% of the reviews were submitted

312
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:17,119
And that's fishy because it is way more reviews than any other 3-day stretch

313
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
And they're really positive

314
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
So it looks like maybe

315
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,775
Somebody paid for a bunch of fake reviews

316
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Around

317
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,895
The way that sometimes works is that a seller might want to boost their rank

318
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,735
They want to sell more product and then eat my positive reviews

319
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
So their sides when they come by these fake reviews

320
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
But then those positive reviews

321
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
All posted on the same time

322
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,487
And so for Tommy after reading through all those reviews learning the tricks

323
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Utrade

324
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,583
What percentage of those 580

325
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
You think we're tainted or bias

326
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Probably all of them

327
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,287
Like nearly 100% or maybe 100%

328
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,871
Yeah our something is wrong with them

329
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
Xiaomi

330
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
Was on this mission

331
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
To clean up

332
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
The fake reviews on his own website

333
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,551
And they looked at Amazon and he finds out

334
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
Even Amazon

335
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
Ssj ganti problem

336
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
BS reviews

337
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Not only that

338
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,767
If he ever wants to go on Amazon and buy something again

339
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
He's realizing he's going to have to spend hours

340
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Going

341
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Review by reviewed

342
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
To figure out what is even

343
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Untrustworthy

344
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,519
Or I could write a computer program to do all this in

345
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Seconds

346
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
Access these Pages automatically

347
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
Pull the data and

348
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,663
Give me you know

349
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
Better picture of the reviews

350
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,599
And I'm sitting there thinking like and if I wrote that computer program to do all this and seconds I could point it at any product

351
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
And so Tommy Noonan went back to work and in essence

352
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
He coded a version of himself

353
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
Dolphin internet review detector

354
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
They can help any of us

355
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
Pull up an item on Amazon

356
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
And cut through all the BS reviews to find

357
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
Just a good one

358
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:59,263
He started a new website that he called review meta.

359
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
And after the break

360
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
We'll go shopping

361
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Support for this pot

362
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
And the following message

363
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919

364
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199

They're a big part of your life

00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,879
You put the time into making them your own

369
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,927
So now it's time to protect them

370
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231

But they'll be there for you when you need

383
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
What do you need

384
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
I just went on vacation and my

385
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,695
Phone died four times because I do not

386
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
Ex-div iPhone cable

387
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
Got so you go to Amazon and

388
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
You put an iPhone cable

389
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
Yes sir we have

390
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,567
Over 20000 results for iPhone cables that's a lot

391
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
Alright so this one has 277 reviews

392
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Four stars like that

393
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
It looks great on the surface

394
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
And then you take the URL

395
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,063
Copy it and then you paste it into review meta

396
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Okay and then I hit

397
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903

Big 5 hours

401
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,191
At any rate eventually it spits out a report and we got Tommy Noonan on the line

402
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
To walk us through a few of the things his website

403
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
Flags about these iPhone

404
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
Okay so for this product we see that

405
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
Over the course of five days

406
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
This product got

407
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
78% of 30

408
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
And on top of that

409
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
The reviews from those high-volume days

410
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,623
Give the product

411
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,439
4.9 star rating on average

412
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
These reviews of those 5 days

413
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
Pretty suspicious

414
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,863
Especially when you look at the reviews from those 5 days

415
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
Compared to the average reviews

416
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
The way my pasta

417
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,775
Tommy says the reviews for these cables raise a few other red flags

418
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,335
As well there was one issue

419
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,687
With words that were being used over and over again in the reviews

420
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:19,551
So the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we build a gigantic list

421
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
Of all of

422
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
The

423
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:27,231
Phrases that are used in the reviews that are peanut-free words or more and then we go

424
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,791
Algorithm is able to filter out normal phrases

425
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
For example

426
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
It was the

427
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,447
And this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that

428
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
You would not expect it

429
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
For example

430
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,895
The court is very tough and doesn't Bend like the cords do but that's probably a good thing

431
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
That's not

432
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,759
That you shouldn't see that in more than one review but for here we see it in

433
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
3 reviews

434
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,879
End in 7 reviews someone wrote it

435
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
It's easy to get it back onto the

436
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
The core dance music

437
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,023
I don't know what it means seven people feel that

438
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,887
Well seven people also say they performed their Duty with honor Andres

439
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,471
Respect and there is the incorrect

440
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
Yeah so

441
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
Tommy software roundabout

442
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,407
Does indifferent test on iPhone cable reviews

443
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
His reports

444
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
Get out an adjusted rate

445
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
So it went from a

446
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
Four star out of five

447
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,159
With 177 reviews on Amazon

448
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
Any adjusted rating on review meta

449
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
Is 1.7 Stars

450
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
After 10 reviews

451
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
Which is another way of saying

452
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
Tommy side only trusted

453
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
6% of the reviews

454
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,727
And a trustworthy reviews say

455
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
Actually these cables are crap

456
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,311
Tommy says generally speak

457
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Cables like this

458
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,639
Are exactly the

459
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
The kind of product

460
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
The wines of cluttered with

461
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
Anything with like low manufacturing costs

462
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087

463
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,439

466
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,119
We of course we sell to Amazon about the

467
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
And they declined it going tape but

468
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
They are familiar with Tommy's website

469
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Ascentis

470
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775

471
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
About it

472
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,127
Review meta itself admits that they do not have the Danzig City

473
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
See if you could do

474
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
Non weightlifter

475
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
Oh okay

476
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,527
Review meta itself admits

477
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,599
They do not have the data to know or even say with icon

478
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
It's whether a review is

479
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,999
According to what Amazon is saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his

480
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
Totally admits that

481
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
His sight is looking for patterns of unusual

482
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Behavior in

483
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,215
There's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a

484
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Buy Amazon

485
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,823
That is a problem we have hundreds of millions of reviews on am

486
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,895
And of that total less than 1% are in Arthur

487
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,735
Amazon also told us that is investing in its own system

488
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
How to catch fake reviewers

489
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
Amazon is saying there's not a problem

490
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
But we're working on it

491
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
And this makes me like

492
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
Wonder a little bit how much should I

493
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Trust

494
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Beeg sites like

495
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
John are actually going to go out of their way

496
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Fix this

497
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,679
So it's complicated right because these e commerce sites

498
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,983
They make money when they sell more

499
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
Red Lake it doesn't matter if

500
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:23,359
It's a positive fake review if someone buys a product that's good for the

501
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,431
There might come a time

502
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,991
Where there's just too many fake review

503
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
Sure like there's a Tipping Point where

504
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Enough

505
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,599
Trust is lost

506
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
That

507
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
We all just give up

508
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Yeah fun internet shop

509

People go back to her friends for recommendation

512
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,167
Well yeah

513
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
There is a point

514
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,007
Wait just one set for all of us

515
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
And we have to go back to talking to a friend's again
