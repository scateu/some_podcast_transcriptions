1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:07,168
It's been kind of a rough year for people who believe in free trade you know people in one country should be

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,472
Be able to sell stuff to people in other countries

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,240
Without too much

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,776
Yeah there was this massive

5
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:16,384
Trade deal that the US has been negotiating with Europe and that seems to be falling apart

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,432
People in the UK voted to leave

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,528
What is the largest free-trade Block in the world that European Union in a word over the bricks

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:26,624
The boat and the TPP the trans-pacific partnership

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,696
Giant free trade deal that look like it was going to be

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,256
When a President Obama's biggest accomplishments

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,840
But the two people most likely to take Obama's job next year

12
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,400
The two candidates who agree on almost nothing

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,168
Big Rihanna

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,472
TPP the trade deal

15
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,264
Transpacific

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,568
A horrible deal for our country

17
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,616
I oppose it now

18
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,664
I'll oppose it after the election

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,456
And I'll oppose it as president

20
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
For decades

21
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:57,600
President after president Democrats and Republicans have all been Pro free trade

22
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,416
We've had one free trade deal after another

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,232
Now it's like the complete opposite

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,256
What happened

25
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,560

Madam

55
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
I'm Adam

56
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
That's like a

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Call Grandpa palindrome

58
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
True

59
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,400
So okay for Adam Smith we talked to an economic historian named Doug Irwin and we said all right

60
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,984
Let's start by telling the world how amazing Adam Smith

61
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
Adam Smith lived with his mother

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
There's a bachelor

63
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,616
He didn't go out at night

64
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
Come on you can do better than that

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,248
You of all people Duggar wedding

66
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
He was captured by gypsies

67
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
What is kidnapped

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
For real

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,672
Yes the Adam Smith

70
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
Liam Smith

71
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
He almost was lost Humanity

72
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Okay that's

73
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
Possibly apocryphal that's

74
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,448
But but what is true is Adam Smith grew up and basically invented economics As We Know

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,496
An itchy part of that was

76
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
Thinking about trade

77
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
In this way that was

78
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
Really revolutionary and that frankly is

79
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
Still Central to the way economist

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
So at the time people measured the wealth of

81
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
The wealth

82
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Of a Nation

83
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
By how much gold

84
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
The country hat

85
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,416
And and the pile of gold is what makes you rich it's gold

86
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
That's right who doesn't want to go up

87
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
And everything country did was to get

88
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,864
More gold they would explore they would go to war they would take over continents

89
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
And they would

90
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Trade

91
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,240
International trade with a gold making machine

92
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
You said cloth

93
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Orgreen to France

94
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
France Senegal

95
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,664
But the key to the way people thought about trade at the time was

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,992
You wanted to keep that gold in your country

97
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
And the way you do that is

98
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,576
You do not buy stuff from other

99
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
You want to buy less

100
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
From them

101
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:17,280
Then they buy from you you want to run a trade surplus that's how you get a big pile of gold in your country

102
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
So countries put up high tariffs

103
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Taxes on

104
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
Quotas to discourage people

105
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,775
From buying stuff from other countries they basically said keep the gold here by everything in this country

106
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,591
Atoms with looked at these policies interested

107
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Doesn't make sense

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
He said it's not how much gold you have

109
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,503
How higher wages are in the standard of living of people

110
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,831
Not what's socked away in the government coffers

111
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,391
The standard of living of ordinary people that's just

112
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
How much stuff can Ordinary People Buy

113
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
And those High tariffs

114
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,303
And quotas they made it so people could not buy as much

115
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
Stuff in Great Britain at the time

116
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,655
They had. Lot of restrictions on imported food

117
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,751
It's just harming working people by making them by high-priced food

118
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,591
Adam Smith says this at the time revolutionary thing it says

119
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Get rid of those terrorists

120
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,735
Poodle get cheaper lots of things will get cheaper people's standard of living will

121
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,551
They'll be able to buy more stuff the nation will get wealth

122
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,671
Now there are farmers who are selling expensive food who might be temporarily hurt

123
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
But the idea Adam Smith said was that those farmers

124
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
They will change jobs they can start saying

125
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
Making clock

126
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,215
Which maybe I can make better and more cheaply than people in other countries and then they can trade that cloth

127
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
Batman Smith steps back and says

128
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Free trade to Knicks

129
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Everybody better off

130
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
And some sort of Rights

131
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
The original get rich

132
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,479
QuickBooks what four nations write The Wealth of Nations is the name of his book

133
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,807
And the book is a big hit in Britain and it makes its way to America

134
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,879
Wealth of Nations was brought over on ships

135
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
United States

136
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:52,255
And Jefferson Adams Hamilton they already Adam Smith

137
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,327
We have the Constitution 1787

138
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,703
First Congress meet 1789 the second bill they pass is a tariff bill

139
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,799
It's one of the first things they do because the government needs Revenue

140
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
They had the book

141
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
Jacob they read the book

142
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
They ignored the book

143
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Yeah but tariffs

144
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
Starts out as a way to get Revenue

145
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,295
But as soon as the US has any industry to speak

146
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
Factory owner start going to Cairo

147
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,183
Hey we need more tariffs to protect us from foreign competition

148
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
Congress

149
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
And from that point forward in American history

150
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,863
There are apps in their downs but pretty much we are a protectionist country

151
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,191
And this political outcome it makes sense when you look at

152
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
It was really a classic thing you have this

153
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,567
Relatively small number of people who benefit from it

154
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,615
They care a lot about

155
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
You know these are people with factories

156
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,015
Who would have to compete against Imports so of course they're going to push for a tear

157
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
They're going to go to college

158
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
Person say

159
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,415
Look I'm going to go out of business all my workers are going to lose their jobs you have to protect

160
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
But then you have basically

161
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Everybody else

162
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
Who are going to pay more for their stuff

163
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
As a result

164
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,983
But it's not as big of a deal because it's not like their job or their company depends on it they are going to get on a horse and ride the washing

165
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
DC

166
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,591
The other senators and complain that their stockings say cost $0.02

167
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
How dare you sir

168
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,967
Yep this is like a political truth you know when you have a concentrated benefit

169
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Escape the fact

170
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
Up against the diffuse cost

171
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Everybody else

172
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
The concentrated benefit usually win

173
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
Even if it's much smaller than the car

174
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
And that's really the story of chapter one

175
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
Tariffs win

176
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Adam Smith

177
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
And

178
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,375
Tariffs in the US state really high

179
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
For a really long

180
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
But

181
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,751
That finally changes largely because

182
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
Of 1

183
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Guy

184
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
I need to take this one

185
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Chapter 2

186
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
A man

187
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
A plan

188
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
A free-trade hero

189
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Cordell Hull

190
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
Not a pound

191
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,623
True but this was the man who Unleashed free-trade upon the entire world

192
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Was he abducted by gypsy

193
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
Caesar the baby no

194
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
What is a hillbilly from Tennessee

195
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
Doug Erwin

196
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
Cordell Hull grew up in a log cabin

197
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,959
I read that went over the kid he would go on these trips where they would make a raft out of a bunch of logs

198
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
Float on the logs down the river and then sell the logs

199
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,359
In the software Hall was growing up and this is around

200
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
The turn of the 20th Cent

201
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
Most politicians

202
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,967
Were anti tariff

203
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
Not because they read their Adam Smith and thought every

204
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Paper goods

205
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
But because the farmers miss out

206
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
Grew tobacco and cotton

207
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
Which people all over the world wanted to buy

208
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
They were

209
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Beloved

210
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,607
But the US Factory owners these are mostly Northern Republicans at the time

211
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,703
They mostly wanted to sell stuff to customers in the US so they wanted

212
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
Protection from foreign competition they wanted Terror

213
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,799
Cordell Hull becomes a lawyer

214
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Congressman from Tennessee

215
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
Entering World War 1

216
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
He has this revelation

217
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
He realizes

218
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
Terfs aren't just about

219
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Economics

220
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
There is something much bigger it stay

221
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
And as he looked at the war he said

222
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
Your economic causes to this war

223
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,327
Those causes are that there was protectionist policies the lack of international free international trade

224
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,447
And that led to political fractions which led to war in there for my mission my life goal

225
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Is to bring about free or trade

226
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,799
Because that will bring about world peace

227
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
Think of how amazing his argument was

228
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,199
He was saying Germany and France would not have needed to

229
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
The fight in those trenches

230
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,039
If they traded more stuff with each other

231
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,135
If there were thousands of businessmen in Paris and Berlin saying hey

232
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
Don't shoot them those are my customers

233
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
But that argument didn't really

234
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
I'm really convinced the

235
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,863
It wouldn't be the first thing you would say caused World War but he

236
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
Quail Hollow West onto it and pushed and pushed and pushed it

237
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,519
In the thirties hole becomes FDR Secretary of State

238
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,407
And he does have some success Congress passed this law that said the president could negotiate lower tariffs with other countries

239
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
Still truant says it holes

240
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Obsession

241
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,319
Set the key to World Peace was free trade that all you need man

242
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Is free trade

243
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
This just

244
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Rain

245
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
False in the 1930s

246
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,719
People thought he was nuts

247
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,095
Reason why there's Nazi Germany is because they didn't trade enough because if not free trade

248
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
And even Roosevelt President Roosevelt.

249
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,215
Now he's a really a little bit misplaced here is you know

250
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
The world is burning up around us

251
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
Please talk about trade agreements

252
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,871
And people said that's just not yet he's off

253
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Bass

254
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,479
And there was something else there was another reason why

255
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
People were not

256
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
Taking Cordell Hull Siri

257
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
He also spoke with a lisp bespoke like Elmer Fudd

258
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,951
Dean Acheson in his Memoirs he was at the State Department of time

259
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
He said

260
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,303
He's off enunciated words do to a speech impediment emerged as

261
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
Reciprocal trade

262
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
A program to reduce Telus

263
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
This is what about you

264
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
They are

265
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
They're behind us back

266
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,151
But we really haven't reached the Mulhall moment cuz he does win

267
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,735
Okay don't.

268
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Royalty free

269
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
How Cordell Hull change the world

270
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
Cordell Hull's moment came

271
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
Because of World War II

272
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,463
The state department is not responsible for fighting a war that's

273
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
So they're spending the entire War thinking about what what comes next

274
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,911
And there's this moment there's just pause nobody knows which direction to go in and

275
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
Courthouse steps forward and says how about this direction

276
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,007
Absolutely

277
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,895
I'm going to play some music under the Oaks

278
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,735
Give me a Cordell Hull speech that is the most idealistic

279
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,855
The most Visionary the best possible pitch of his

280
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
For free trade after the war

281
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
I'd say this is the patch

282
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
By turning inward

283
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
United States

284
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
Bandits International responsibility

285
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
And we had world war that was a

286
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
Grievous mistake

287
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
We cannot repeat

288
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
Keep this mistake after World War II

289
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
We have to come an economic leader of political leader in the world

290
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
An essential component

291
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,199
To ensuring peace in the postwar period

292
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,759
Is having a strong economic Foundation

293
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
People are fully employed

294
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
And trading with one another

295
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
And their economically prosperous

296
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
Ellevest of stake in preserving peace

297
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
If they're unemployed

298
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,767
And there's economic rivalry and bitterness and resentment

299
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
About

300
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
Other countries stealing our jobs or this or that

301
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
It's going to lead to a political breakdown

302
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
And actually to another War

303
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
That's pretty good pets

304
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,847
Yeah and imagine hearing it as as world war was winding

305
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,407
You know the world was exhausted

306
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
Devastated

307
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,503
And Cordell Hull skip forward with this plan

308
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
This Plane had been working on for deck

309
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,647
And the president. President Roosevelt strongly supported all this and

310
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
That was his moment

311
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
Sequoia Hall

312
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Is standing there

313
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
He finishes his pitch and there was dead silence

314
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
And then all the sudden the back

315
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
Dean Acheson

316
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,703
The man who had mocked him for speech impediment stands up

317
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
And start the slow clap

318
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
Boxers with Cordell Hull

319
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
And then everybody starts to stand up

320
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,527
Call Holly

321
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,671
1945 Cordell Hull

322
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
Win the Nobel

323
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
Peace Prize

324
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Amazing

325
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
UPS astonishingly

326
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,887
Only the last sentence was through the whole thing about absent in the room

327
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
That's from the movie you just made up in your head

328
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
Black tattoos movie

329
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
Who won the Nobel Peace

330
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,847
In 1945 he won the Nobel Prize

331
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
Partly for his work creating the United Nations

332
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,479
Also for his idea that trade barriers are

333
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
And I'm quoting from the award speech ear quote

334
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,087
Barriers also to Lasting

335
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
A couple years after that holes

336
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
Free trade dream

337
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Comes true

338
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
23 countries create

339
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Wait for it

340
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
The general agreement

341
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
On tariffs

342
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Contrave

343
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
It is

344
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,447
The Gap the first

345
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
Really big mechanism

346
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
For free trade between countries

347
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Any amazing thing about this

348
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
Was it the usual people who would

349
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Stand in the way of

350
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
Us manufacturer

351
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,319
Also mean looked around the world and said you know what we're the only factor is left standing

352
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:22,719
This is a chance for us to sell to the world yet so the manufacturers and for that matter of the Union's to like they were like

353
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,327
Yeah this will be more jobs for us let's lower tariff so we can sell more stuff to the rescue

354
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
And Jacob

355
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Look what happened

356
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
The gap

357
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Ground

358
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,727
Down trade barriers around the world

359
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
In 1945 at the end of the war

360
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
Tariffs on Imports to the US were round

361
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
30%

362
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
30%

363
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
50 years later

364
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
By the mid 90s

365
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Cursive font

366
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
5

367
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
Percent 30%

368
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
To 5%

369
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,159
That's that's essentially the end of a chapter 2

370
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
Cordell Hull and for that matter Adam Smith

371
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
They want

372
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Chapter 3

373
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
The star last chapter chapter 3

374
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,143
Able was I ere I saw Seattle

375
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:10,847
So a free-trade one why does it seem like we're still arguing about this why are we talkin about trade

376
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
All the time

377
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
I called up Joe stiglitz

378
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,967
He is famously

379
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
Skeptical of or lot of

380
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
Globalization and parts of

381
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,135
The trades he's also famous economist won the Nobel Prize the econ prize

382
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,999
Back in the 90s he was an advisor to Bill Clinton and worked at the World Bank

383
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,839
And at the time when he got to Washington he noticed something

384
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Sprint

385
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,679
One of the realizations I had

386
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
Was that the Free Trade Agreement

387
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,543
We're not free trade agreements they were just called three

388
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
Free Trade Agreement

389
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,919
Lower some tariffs but remember tears were already super low

390
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,479
A bigger deal according to stick

391
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Other things

392
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Going on

393
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
In these tray degrees

394
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,927
A corporation disagrees with a foreign government about a certain regulation

395
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,231
Yeah that trade deals have special like

396
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
Panels to settle those disagreements

397
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
The deals also had stuff about like

398
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
How long drug patent

399
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
It's for good in different countries

400
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
And it kind of started looking at all this stuff

401
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
And sing weight

402
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
There was a broad sense

403
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,639
Daddy should be in a trade agreement they were actually restricting trade

404
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
And it wasn't just a car

405
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,599
This is the sound of thousands of people chanting and protesting in the streets of Seattle

406
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
The year was 1999

407
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,023
And everybody was there to protest a meeting of the WTO the World Trade Organization

408
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Robert Smith

409
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,607
You are a cub reporter in those

410
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,703
Well as we saw yesterday I mean clearly there are enough

411
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Police officer

412
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Here although I don't

413
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
See them now and I don't

414
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Really know where they are

415
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
I'm sure they're ready

416
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
To shut down a protest

417
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,015
Did you get that

418
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,855
The wax cylinder and sent it to us

419
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:03,487
Baby Robert Smith at 12 years old your voice hasn't changed yet

420
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,607
Sore in the streets of Seattle people are protesting the WTO which

421
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,911
Is the modern incarnation of

422
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,263
Look at the thing they Cordell Hull inspired Avid change its name to

423
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
WTO World Trade

424
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,151
You better have been just a couple years before they happen in the mid-90s and I have this Theory

425
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
That I totally just made up that

426
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Probably

427
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
Siri is

428
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,575
But that was a huge branding mistakes changing

429
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
Cuz you don't think I'm dad

430
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,183
The general agreement on tariffs and trade

431
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
So boring

432
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,791
You don't even get to the end of the acronym before you like I got to go do some

433
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
World Trade

434
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,191
WTO

435
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,543
We are going to Lourdes carrots Mr Bond and there's nothing you can do to stop us

436
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
I'm not even going to try and do that

437
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,919
Voice but but I would say that bundling would also be singing like

438
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,319
And we're going to monkey with your regulation we're going to change the Dynamics of power between corporations and government

439
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,111
And that was the amazing thing you saw it

440
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,415
In Seattle the protesters were not

441
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,511
Pairing signs that said oh we need higher tariffs on sneakers

442
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Say

443
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,327
They were there dressed as seater

444
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,887
Saying oh what the WTO does

445
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,447
Is Rouen environmental regulations around the

446
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,287
This is still the trade fight we're having today

447
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
You know when you look at the TPP

448
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
Trans Pacific partnership

449
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,175
This deal that that issue in the presidential election

450
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,247
A lot of the fight over is over stuff like

451
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,063
Generic drugs and companies challenging governor

452
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
So is the TPP even a trade deal

453
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
Not really

454
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Xxxx

455
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,815
Mostly about other things than trade

456
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
So is it possible to be

457
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,655
Pro free trade and anti TPO

458
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
Cities that are consistent

459
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
View

460
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
Yes and you here

461
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
You care a lot of this when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump

462
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Talk about that

463
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
Maybe they do talk about

464
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
A lot of this non-tariff stuff

465
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
Like drugs in rule

466
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,783
The kind of things you might have heard 200 years

467
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
Stuff that someone probably said to Adam Smith

468
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
Face you know hey what about the workers

469
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,439
The workers who compete against Imports are going to be hurt by this

470
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:15,839
Did they definitely both say that but when you get a little more and you read you know Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on trade

471
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,143
There are some some pretty big difference

472
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,447
Right-wing Quint Clinton talks about

473
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
TPP

474
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,007
One of the things she says is

475
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,311
Us workers need more of a safe

476
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,151
You don't trade deals make our economy as a whole get wealthy

477
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
But some people do get her

478
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,223
One thing you can do is

479
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,063
Pick some of that extra wealth you're getting from trade and give it to the

480
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
People who get hurt

481
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,367
Is it like a standard

482
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,135
Economic idea

483
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:46,047
And whatever the rhetoric maybe now run PPP Clinton's views on trade are pretty firmly in the Cordell Hull

484
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
Call Adam Smith

485
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Universe

486
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,679
Which is basically the same universe that Barack Obama lives in in

487
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,703
George W bush

488
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,543
For that Bill Clinton it's the universe where trade between countries

489
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Is can make both countries better off

490
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Donald Trump tok

491
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,687
More about trade in terms of winners and losers

492
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,015
China has been killing us on trade Mexico taking our job

493
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,343
Cordell Hull is a wimp and a loser sad!

494
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
It's as if

495
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
Donald Trump looks at the world and says hey

496
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,791
Everybody's laid down their tradeweb

497
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
End

498
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:23,935
Why don't we pick up this pointed stick when we pick up this 45% tariffs on imports from China

499
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,263
And poke them with Joe stiglitz says that is a dangerous stick

500
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,311
Cooperation

501
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,359
In what area does buildup

502
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:37,247
Cooperation now there's trade

503
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Peace out

504
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,575
By the same token aggressive

505
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
Fitness in one area can lead to aggressiveness

506
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,207
In another part of the danger of trump

507
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,999
That you could

508
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,535
Throwing hand grenade

509
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
In

510
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,887
The construction of which took decades

511
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
I think of Cordell whole world live

512
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,751
Today and watching the presidential race he would

513
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
Say listen

514
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
May be tempting

515
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:06,687
To take a certain point of view for votes or it may be tempting to use a tariff as a

516
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,247
As a weapon for a short-term gain

517
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
What he would say is like

518
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
Think about what I lived

519
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,855
I quit alcohol

520
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
The horrors of world

521
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
A World War

522
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,976
Is Slappy a high tariff on another

523
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
Country is not just about

524
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
It's about something much bigger

525
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
