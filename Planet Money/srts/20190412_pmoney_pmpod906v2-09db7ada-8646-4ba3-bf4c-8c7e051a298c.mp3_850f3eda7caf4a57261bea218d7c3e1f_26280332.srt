00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
About our house this is Carrillo Fuentes a documentary filmmaker who was 3 years old the day the crew started

A little before 7 a.m. president Salvador Allende cancel call

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,416
The Chilean Navy has rebelled in the port city of Valparaiso

17
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,256
He rushes downtown to La moneda the presidential Palace

18
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:11,168
Tanks and troops fill the street on the radio and talks to his country

19
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,408
I have faith in Chile and its desk

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,528
The military tells IND surrender he refuses

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,648
Tanks open fire on the couch by ende asked that the women be allowed to leave

22
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,208
And they are then the bombardment start

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,328
Fighter jets and Rockets into the palace

24
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
And inside fires break out

25
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,728
Buy afternoon agenda realizes there's no way out

26
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,056
She shoots himself in the head

27
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
Back out in the streets

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
The Army rounds up Hyandai supporters

29
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,808
One Gabrielle Valdez who's now a professor at Columbia University was studying at Princeton that day

30
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:04,416
He gets a panicked phone call from his father

31
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,488
Gallegos either the possibility that they would exaggerate

32
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,328
When he says the fact that there were people floating in the river

33
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
Unnightmare

34
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,008
Are you in the supporters are beaten and shot in the streets thousands are herded into Stadium

35
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:25,408
One of them is Victor Jara the Chilean Woody Guthrie soldiers break are his fingers in

36
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,480
And tell him you'll never play the guitar again

37
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
An officer plays Russian roulette with him he loads a bullet into a gun Spencer chamber pulls the trigger

38
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
Until it's over

39
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,488
Then they shoot his body more than 40 times

40
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
And dumped him in a street in Santiago Chile an economist who studied at the universe

41
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
City of Chicago

42
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
They're watching

43
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,496
To them getting a car

44
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,568
Drive to the top of a hill and watch the phone

45
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,856
Chicago boy Ralph looters is living in Washington DC

46
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,416
Remember he was the one who had Milton Friedman essay

47
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
The thesis advisor

48
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
He got a call to

49
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
But his reaction wasn't

50
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,120
Fear of confusion

51
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
Military coup

52
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Which took place

53
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,032
Managed by people who sought and democracy

54
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,640
The contradiction that difficult contradiction is that

55
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,224
Chile was a democracy before the coup

56
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,320
And if there's one thing of coup is not a coup is not democratic

57
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,392
Some people may have wanted free markets and democracy

58
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,976
But what they what happened instead was in fact

59
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,768
Authoritarian government

60
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Ed

61
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,752
Insulate democratic election

62
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
Led directly to a socialist

63
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Government

64
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,176
And then the military took over by force

65
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
In the name of the free market

66
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
Hello and welcome to

67
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
The Planet Money

00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
I'm Jasmine

69
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,576
And I know Elle King

70
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:14,720
In the United States during the Cold War we believe that democracy and free markets went hand-in-hand

71
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
But then

72
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
There was what happened in Chile

73
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
Today on the show chili goes from socialism to capitalism by force and with the help of the United

74
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,103
States it's the story of a coup a ruthless dictator and a bunch of economist

Hey it's candy Malone from Planet Money the podcast you're listening to right now

84
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
We are podcast

85
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
However

86
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,175
We are also occasionally a video series and we have a brand new season

87
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,759
A Planet Money shorts out right now the covers everything from

88
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,319
The tooth fairy and tooth inflation to

89
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:16,159
The man who invented expensive vodka and convinced us all it was worth

90
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
I am in that

91
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Episode

92
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
I grew a beard for it

93
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,767
And I shaved my beard

94
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
It's like to see that

95
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,655
It is at npr.org Planet Money shorts

96
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,983
That's npr.org planet

97
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,871
The overnight chili has gone from democracy to military rule

98
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
And now

99
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,735
The economy the inflation the shortages the crushing deficit

100
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
All of that is the military's problem

101
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,623
Or more specifically the general who takes charge

102
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
Augusto

103
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Pinochet

104
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
He's Infamous now for his brutality

105
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,559
But back then he was in unknown he had no government

106
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
Experience and certainly no economic

107
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
Experience says rolls looters

108
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703
I saw you quoted once a saying

109
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
When it came to economics

110
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,031
Pinochet was an idiot

111
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
He didn't know anything

112
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,615
I didn't say it

113
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
I think

114
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,431
Because I usually don't use that expression

115
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,271
But that he didn't know anything about the economics right

116
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
Definitely

117
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
Look this make sense

118
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,903
Pinochet went to military school as a

119
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
The teenagers he's a lifelong Soldier

120
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
He's not an economist

121
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
But this is not a problem

122
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,911
Because there are these University of Chicago trained Economist already living in Santiago

123
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
And a small group of them has dry

124
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
Crafted a plan to fix the economy

125
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
And

126
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
The military has the plant

127
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
NJ lottery

128
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
The Brick

129
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,455
And and so he decided to

130
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
Appoint

131
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
Chicago boys to the

132
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
Chemical elements

133
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,671
In the days after the cool the experimenting in free markets begin

134
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
Just a little

135
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
The military bust of time unions

136
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
The Crackdown on the black market

137
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
And they on fix the prices

138
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
The food

139
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,423
I'm fixing the prices is sound economic logic

140
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
Price-fixing have been causing shortages

141
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,591
But if food producers can charge the prices they want they will produce food

142
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
So they do

143
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
And the price of food goes through the roof

144
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,783
And for 18 months it kind of just goes like this its economic

145
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Tinkering

146
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
But Chili's big problem is inflation

147
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Chronic

148
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
Dizzying inflation

149
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
It's running it over 300%

150
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
Do you know who knows a lot about inflation

151
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,071
Rolf luders

152
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
And

153
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
His old thesis advisor

154
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,983
A guy who's made his reputation on monetary policy and fixing inflation

155
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
Is it true that in 75

156
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,871
You personally invited Milton Friedman to come to Chile

157
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
Yes

158
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
Repairing vitamin B7

159
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
But he came to Chile and 7th

160
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
85

161
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,623
By now Friedman is a superstar

162
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,183
He is an evangelist with one simple

163
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,999
Free markets WETA free Society

164
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
He meets with Pinochet in a conference

165
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,399
Center and there's a picture of this meeting that I've spent a lot of time looking at

166
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Init

167
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,751
Pinochet is sitting in an armchair with his legs crossed

168
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,079
Leaning toward freedmen and looking apprehensive

169
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,919
And Friedman is leaning back legs also cross

170
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
And he has this

171
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
Self-satisfied look on his face

172
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
Infinite resistance

173
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Sanctum

174
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,671
And ask him what is thought about the economy it's on

175
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Ann Friedman

176
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
Basically

177
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
About the needs

178
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
Office shock treatment

179
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
In macroeconomics

180
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Stamps

181
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Eshakti

182
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
Shock treatment meaning

183
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,519
You changed fast and you changed dramatically

184
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,079
Sample treatment always used

185
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
It's

186
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
You see it hurts less

187
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
To cut the tail

188
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
Off a dock if you cut it as once

189
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
Then if you got the thin slice

190
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
Yeah okay

191
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,623
And then empty treatment say that to Pinochet

192
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,207
Where is the two peanuts at 12 to 2

193
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
To everybody

194
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
He's right

195
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,607
About a month after that meeting the government announces

196
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,911
The shock treatment is about to begin

197
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
Step 1 austerity

198
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
Cut government spending

199
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Including subsidies

200
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Freeport PA

201
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
Step to tighten monetary policy

202
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
Stop Printing money

203
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
It's painful

204
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
Taxes are raised

205
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Is the government jobs are

206
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Unemployment spikes

207
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
The middle class and the poor are really

208
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,671
Step 3 open the economy to the rest of the world

209
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:38,559
Chile has had these insanely High import tariffs protecting their industries from competition

210
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
Super example the country has

211
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
17 Carcano

212
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,239
That combined makes 17000 cars

213
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
It's totally unofficial

214
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,407
Now the Chicago boys cut the tariffs and all of these foreign made cars come pouring in

215
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:59,295
Columbia Professor Juan Gabriel Valdez because of this move a lot of people lose their jobs

216
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,343
Sekolah Jillian Industrial

217
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Sector

218
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Broke

219
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
You know matters of

220
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,999
Under the level of unemployment was brutal

221
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,327
Valdez noticed early on all of these

222
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,887
Chicago boys being hired into the government

223
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
He wrote a book about it years ago

224
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,775
And he interviewed a professor who taught the Chicago boys

225
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
And this subject

226
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383
Came up the subject of how like overnight

227
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
They cut the tariffs that were protecting to lay an industry

228
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,783
And he used every American word to describe

229
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
What is meant to do that

230
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
What was the word

231
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,767
You have to be a cold-blooded son-of-a-b**** to do that

232
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
But cutting the tariffs

233
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
Did change the country

234
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
Especially if you had money

235
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
If you have money now you can buy whatever you want

236
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
From wherever you were

237
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,615
Patricia arancibia clavel at historian who's written a bunch about the Chicago boys

238
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
Remembers how

239
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Quickly things change

240
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
Invisible

241
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Oh no

242
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
Oenophile

243
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,343
One day eyeglasses shop

244
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
When is shoe store

245
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
You can find a lot of them

246
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,023
It is a Pato Rojo Verde Azul there was not only

247
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
Day one red shoe that you could buy

248
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,143
You could find blue shoes and green shoes

249
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,543
Chilean journalist on Oscar Romero was translating for me this all happened before he was born so he was listening and he was

250
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
It's getting kind of ant

251
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
This letter

252
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Economic

253
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Competition

254
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,199
So they shoot that custody

255
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
The custard

256
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
Adult some pesos

257
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
No custard

258
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
500 peso

259
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,671
She says all of this starts a revolution in the way people think

260
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,791
Before you graduate from college and then you'd go work for a state-owned company

261
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,863
You didn't think about profits or competition

262
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
But the Chicago boys are privatizing everything

263
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
Who Industries are moving into private hands

264
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
Chile's government does hold onto the copper in

265
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,871
It's the biggest business in Chile

266
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,711
Some things are just too valuable to put on the free market

267
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Yeah I guess so

268
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
Aside from the copper industry

269
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
The US is over the moon about

270
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:15,743
Richard Nixon even says he'll take a dictatorship as long as it's not a communist

271
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Dictatorship

272
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,583
When they are dictatorial I would say they are dictatorial

273
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
I would also have to

274
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
On the other side

275
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,751
Indicate that they are non-communist

276
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,847
The Chicago Bulls change the laws to make it easier to invest in Chile

277
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
So us companies come

278
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,015
Everything from Banks to oil companies to General Motors which had left under IND

279
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,599
Billions of dollars in foreign investment in loans

280
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
Come pouring in

281
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
The economy starts growing

282
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
And people start Rhapsody

283
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047
About Chile's economic miracle

284
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,703
Chilean public TV start broadcasting Milton Friedman TV show it's called free to choose Alex

285
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
Some people hear you may be appalled by his ideas

286
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
Like others extremely enthusiastic about the

287
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
Whichever way it goes I will be fascinated

288
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
What Milton Friedman has to say

289
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,967
Carrillo Fuentes was a kid.

290
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
This is

291
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Amazing

292
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
You know

293
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,623
An economic TV show from an economist

294
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
From the US

295
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
Being aired

296
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
Every week

297
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
In dipolog City

298
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
And on the TV soap operas

299
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,423
The actresses talk about how their Chilean appliances are junk

300
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
And the foreign-made ones are so much

301
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,031
Does Chileans work on swimming

302
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Black matte

303
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Because they felt

304
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
That they were rich

305
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Because

306
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,943
Income was going to grow

307
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,271
Because of the reforms that have been implemented

308
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
It's okay but they're not

309
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
They're just optimist

310
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
And there's a big difference

311
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Between those two

312
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
In the early 1980s

313
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
There's a worldwide recession

314
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
And guess what

315
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Chili's part of the world now

316
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
They have a reception to

317
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
And this is when

318
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,703
In the middle of the night while fluters gets

319
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
The call

320
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,775
He's being officially invited

321
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
To come and work for Pinochet

322
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,871
Did you find Pinochet to be a frightening person

323
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,015
He used to say dick Dublin.

324
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
You say that you know the table

325
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
Glenda means

326
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
Victims dictator

327
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
And so he said he was soft

328
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Dictator

329
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
End

330
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
My personal experience

331
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
What's the tea was actually

332
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
More weak than than strong

333
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,519
This is hard to understand but I'm going to give it a shot

334
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,335
Juan Gabriel Valdez told me that

335
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,687
A couple years after the crew he was interviewing guys from the Chilean military

336
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
And some of them told him

337
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
We did not agree with the sharks

338
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,343
We could see that these policies were hurting people

339
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,719
But when we questioned the Chicago boys did start using this Chicago speak

340
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
They were smarter than us

341
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
They talked over hits

342
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
We have no idea what they were doing

343
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
And if we asked and we debated

344
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,215
Are we mention the consequences these

345
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
Thanks Mike have

346
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Wiiware

347
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,079
Rejected in a very drastic way

348
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,175
And the well we we we we cool answer we would react

349
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,759
The Economist made the generals feel like dummies

350
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
And so the generals were like do what you want

351
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Music

352
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,671
So clearly looters is not afraid of Pinochet

353
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,743
Now he's Minister of Economics and finance

354
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
And he does something.

355
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,607
Seems like it would make Milton Friedman go crazy

356
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
Intervene

357
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
The government bailed out the banks

358
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,263
The irony of this is not lost on Chileans

359
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,359
A New York Times article from back then reports that people started cracking jokes

360
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Calling this

361
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
The Chicago Road to socialism

362
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,503
Looters also renegotiates foreign debt

363
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
He changes the labor laws so that wages can be cut he does a bunch of thing

364
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,183
It takes some time but Chile's economy recovers

365
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,279
Remember these free market policies were supposed to hurt at first

366
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
But work in the long run

367
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
And they did

368
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
The economy stabilizes

369
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
And then it starts to thrive

370
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,775
Other countries call the Chicago Boys in to consult

371
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,871
Today Chile is one of the strongest economies in Latin America

372
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
But

373
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,503
Here is a question that Chileans ask themselves all the time

374
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
Was it worth it

375
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
Imagine this happening in the United

376
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,159
The president shocks Arcana

377
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
Cheap Imports come in

378
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
People lose jobs

379
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,047
The government slashes the social safety

380
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
Your kids college it goes

381
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,375
Private

382
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
Osteo

383
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
What the President says

384
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,983
You know what it's going to be better for you in the long run

385
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
We would vote that president out of office

386
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,127
Augusto Pinochet could not be voted out he was a dictator

387
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,711
If you protested him or protested his policies

388
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
You could be killed

389
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
Port Orchard

390
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
Or you just banished

391
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,927
It was one of those situations where it felt like everyone knew someone

392
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,327
Or knew someone who knew someone it was really complete that's why I'm Gabrielle. That so-and-so whom you know

393
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
Oh has been shot

394
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
So and so whom you know has disappeared

395
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
This is the type of

396
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
So one so who was your friend

397
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,127
And was working at copper mine

398
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
As a

399
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Manager

400
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,735
Was tortured in such a way that you couldn't

401
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
That they could recuperate

402
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
Therefore they decide to do shooting

403
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
I'm sorry is that a real story

404
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,767
That happened to someone you know

405
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
Kenya recycling

406
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
That's true

407
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,887
I just went well fluters Balise to

408
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,959
I know the conditions we have to ensure that

409
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
We either we're going to move towards

410
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
Totalitarian state

411
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Or we would move

412
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,943
Under an ulcerated regime

413
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
To it

414
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,295
Stress free market economy eventually to

415
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Democracy

416
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
You have one of two choices

417
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,719
There was no third way there was no

418
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Of course

419
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Who was not have been

420
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,887
In favor of having a democratic change that with a free market economy

421
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
Everybody with a flight

422
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
But that was not in the car

423
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,775
Because nobody believed that could be done

424
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,639
You follow me that did the IDI

425
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
That you needed government intervention

426
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Economy Inn

427
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,807
So so so deep deep deep ternative

428
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Which Wich

429
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,903
I like of course I like that

430
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,695
Viable

431
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
The people forget the fact

432
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
The factor that

433
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,071
He says Peter Shay told him

434
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,399
Once the economic experiment succeeded

435
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,727
Chili would go back to being a democracy

436
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
Absolutely convinced

437
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
Eventually should prevail

438
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
It's a democracy with social

439
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:00,479
Did he really Pinochet really want someone

440
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,271
I believe I believe

441
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:08,159
After the break

442
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,559
Pinochet takes a huge Gamble and losses

In 1988 Under Pressure Pinochet fall of the Constitution and allowed to lands to vote

455
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,287
Did they want him to stay or go

456
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,639
The economy was so strong by this point that he actually campaigned on it

457
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:06,271
They voted him out anyway a couple of years later at Pinochet handed over power to a democratically elected

458
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
Dead Presidents

459
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
He died in 2006

460
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
Facing charges of murder

461
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Torture and kidnapping

462
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
Some of the soldiers who

463
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
2 tortured and killed the folk singer Victor Jara

464
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
Went to prison

465
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,887
The officer who allegedly played Russian roulette with him did not he moved

466
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,191
To Florida and avoided a criminal trial

467
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,007
A jury there found him liable in a civil suit

468
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,335
Milton Friedman won the Nobel Prize for economics

469
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,639
That visit to Chile with dog

470
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,919
For the rest of his life

471
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,735
Rolf luders doesn't mention any regrets

472
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
He's a public figure

473
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:42,623
And every once in awhile someone will say something nasty to him or about him

474
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,927
On the subway or in the movie theater

475
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
About how he works for peanuts

476
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
What happened

477
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,143
I will continue to go to the movies and then the theater

478
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
I don't care

479
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
Hundreds of thousands

480
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,287
Look up people

481
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
Who greet me on the streets 2

482
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,639
To him the numbers prove the point

483
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
Chile's inflation

484
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
That chronic seemingly unfixable problem

485
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,063
Today it's stable and low

486
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
Its median income is one of the highest

487
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
In South America

488
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,696
It's poverty rate one of the lowest

489
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:23,840
Patricio clavell the historian was maybe the most forthcoming person I talked to in Santiago

490
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,168
If you said something I feel like other people were dancing around

491
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
Some people are worth

492
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,848
Say that it was easier to open the economy in a country ruled by the military

493
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
And she said

494
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,688
Whether you like it or not

495
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,992
We owe our economic success

496
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
To Pinochet

497
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,112
Now The Interpreter Honus had whatever is the opposite of a poker face

498
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,184
And when she said that his face went dark

499
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,048
Can I ask what you think about that I mean I owe you for this or you know Pinochet how old are you

500
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
I'm

501
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Chinese

502
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:59,424
Do you eat so you are raised in the era of democracy

503
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,496
Do you think that

504
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:09,408
Do you think this is a fair argument that if they wanted to make the economy better they needed a military junta

505
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
Think it's

506
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,528
It's hot it has a lot of

507
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
Gray area

508
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,344
Because of course now

509
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
I grew up in a country where

510
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
My parents

511
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,720
Buy food

512
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,536
I never had to make a cue for

513
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
Brett Favre

514
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,864
Mute for basic

515
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
I personally

516
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240
It regrets

517
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
Very much so

518
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
These things because

519
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,104
It was for me I very

520
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
Violin

521
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Way to do it

522
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
It's

523
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
Huge deer mount

524
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
People who get

525
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
Torture

526
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,528
Forget this

527
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,064
It who were disappeared

528
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,416
Who were killed who were tortured and they were horrible and it was

529
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:58,816
Hey can you tell her what you're saying and ask her does she know you're doing yeah if it's a little gay

530
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,608
Yes yes I understand

531
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,472
A female ovulation.

532
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,544
She told him no one can ever justify the violation

533
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Human rights

534
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,128
There are black spots in human nature

535
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:15,712
Do we have to understand that and look for the good and the truth

536
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,248
Are you convinced by this

537
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
It's

538
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Very hard

539
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
For me to

540
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Embrace that

541
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
Given the recent

542
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,232
Recent best of my family on

543
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
It's

544
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:36,192
I'm not a dick my mother always told me the story about her best friend

545
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,984
When she was young my mother

546
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
A protest and get a protista

547
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
Again Spanish

548
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,128
Her best friend

549
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,176
One day went missing

550
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
And when she showed up

551
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,064
Months later after my mom look for her

552
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
She told her that

553
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
She had

554
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,768
What they did to her was a brutal method of torture which we're not going to hear

555
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:06,144
And it's such a confusing ways such a confusing country and I think

556
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,728
And you just said it it's a revolution but it's a revolution that

557
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,056
For me it was born with violence

558
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
Chili Worcester

00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640

That is very sad

564
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
Very strong

565
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
Things to to realize

566
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
This country my

567
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
Night night

568
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
Did the laboratory

569
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:43,008
For the rest of the world for some people who went to Chicago and learn stuff that they said it will be

570
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Right

571
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,872
It's a pain that I don't think we can

572
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
Make it go away

573
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
You don't think it was worth

574
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
For you it's not worth it

575
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
It wasn't worth it

576
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:03,488

578
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,240
He said to her I owe a lot of debt to the university

579
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,800
This is what she lays like today

580
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:23,456
A generation wins the Great War against Marxism and they say to the young people we did this for you

581
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:27,040
And some of these young people say back yeah

But we wish she hadn't I imagine these Economist the Chicago boys looking up

583
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:39,840
From their experiments so excited and saying this is what we learned but of course

584
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:46,240
The person down there in the petri dish being experimented on is only ever going to answer this is

585
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:52,640
Is what we live
