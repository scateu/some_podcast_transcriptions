00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,584
Last week the biggest investment firm in the world

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,632
Laid off a bunch of it stop stop

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,168
And replace them with

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:07,936
Computer Pro

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,752
This is happening all over Wall Street

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,056
Firms are moving away from having

7
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,360
Humans decide what stocks to buy and sell

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,128
And towards

9
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,176
Having humans program computers

10
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,224
And then letting the computer decide

11
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,248
What to buy and sell

12
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,064
Computers are cheaper than humans

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,904
They are more disciplined they can think about more things at once

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,280
Like they can scan Facebook for Trent they can count the number of cars in Walmart parking lot

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
And then use all that

16
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328
To figure out

17
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,864
What stock to buy and sell

18
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,400
And do it automatic

19
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
This is the way the world is

20
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
This is what the stock market is becoming

21
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:44,800
And I

22
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Want

23
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
In

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,152
I want to see this world from the inside

25
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,224
I want to build a machine that will buy and sell stocks

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,016
For me automatically

27
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,552
Based on some

28
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,112
Cold hard data out there in the world

29
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,392
No Wyld

30
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
Human MO

31
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,976
And I want my machine

32
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
Do it

33
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
Based

34
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
On the tweets

35
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
A president

36
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
Donald J

37
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
Trump

38
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264

51
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
So there's a thing that

52
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,768
Often happens when President Trump

53
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Tweets about

54
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Accompany

55
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,376
When he said something positive about a company

56
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,192
The stock price tends to go up at least for a little while

57
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
What is that something negative the stock price has to go down

58
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
So here's what I want

59
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,872
I want to build a computer program that monitors President Trump's tweets

60
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,176
And when he says something nice about a company

61
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
We buy that company stock and when President Trump tweet something negative about a company we will sell that company stock

62
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:37,440
But that just means that we will set ourselves up to make a profit if the stock price goes down

63
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,536
If you listen to Planet Money for awhile you know that we sometimes

64
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,424
Make investments with our own money that was NPR's money but like my money your money are personal money

65
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,520
We do this weekend you don't get into the world for real feel how the world

66
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
Gotta have skin in the

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
For this project I did some math and I figured out

68
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,944
Did I needed $100 from each member of Planet Money

69
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
So I went around the office

70
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
With my pet

71
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
Starting with Noel King

72
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,856
Terrific is a great idea

73
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,416
Okay so you're in Yu-Gi-Oh how much do I owe you

74
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
$100

75
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,632
How to rent in New York

76
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,728
You'll get it back and then some and then alright I'll break your kneecaps

77
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,544
That is roughly how it went all around the office

78
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,592
Jacob going to play you the tape of when I pushed

79
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
We are going to build

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Stock trading bot

81
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
That will

82
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,016
Trade off of Donald Trump

83
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
Tweets

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,624
You know how he does these things that I have learned about economics

85
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Suggest me the best

86
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Okay

87
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
I responded to her

88
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
You didn't get my $100

89
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,048
Let me just explain myself briefly

90
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,144
Mike Mike basic view of the world is if there's some way to make money out there

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Somebody's already doing it

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,264
Somebody's already got their trumpet I don't believe that we can build a better Trump

93
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
But we're going to try Charnel look obviously

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
I'm not in it for the money I'm in it for the for the

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
And I gladly took your skeptical 100

96
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
I got my

97
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
Thousand dollars from

98
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
My other

99
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
Skeptical colleagues

100
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
I took everybody's money

101
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
I put it in a trading account

102
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
And then I did

103
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
The one more

104
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,744
Very important think before we could get started

105
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
I named

106
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Arbat

107
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Go on

108
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Arbat will be called

109
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Botas

110
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
I see what you did there.

111
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
So you know how the president's Twitter handle POTUS

112
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,543
President of the US the official Twitter handle

113
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
Botas

114
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
Bought of the United

115
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Okay.

116
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:37,759
Okay it's good yeah I'm kind of proud of it but now you got to like build the thing right now you got to make the machine

117
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
So I found some professional

118
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
I found a company that

119
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,671
Buildbox and helps other companies with their trading

120
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
Technology is called

121
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
Trade works with an

122
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
ACT scores at the end of it

123
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,351
Their offices in New Jersey about 90 minutes outside of New York City

124
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
Commercial strip

125
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
It's like very low

126
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,471
I went there to meet with Monte Maggiore their head oven

127
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
He runs

128
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
Whole team of people making all kinds of Bot

129
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,127
He is very secretive about what those parts do

130
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,943
But explain to me the essence of trading with Bots

131
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
In a few

132
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,063
Take a simple idea and do it three thousand times four times a year

133
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,463
It doesn't have to be right that it can be like just slightly right you know and end over overtime it's

134
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
It's like a casino except for the house

135
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,559
Yeah we only have to be right like

136
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,399
Fifty-one 52% of the time right we can be wrong a lot

137
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,471
As long as we're right a little more often than we're wrong

138
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,847
We'll make a lot of money you're starting to come around I like that

139
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
So

140
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
I told him my idea

141
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,967
To get a bot to read Trump's tweets and then by and

142
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
Sell stocks based on that

143
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
And he said first problem

144
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
And the computer read Trump's tweets

145
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Can't figure out

146
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,463
Whether the president is saying something nice or saying something mean

147
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
This is this is the this is what more than positive and negative words this is a computer actually determining the

148
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Sentiment of it

149
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:04,031
Type any sentence in and it will give you a sense of what the cinnamon is

150
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,615
More than you have lying around the office more less

151
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,711
Computers have gotten much better at doing this kind of thing over the past

152
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Sentiment analysis

153
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:19,903
And companies use it a lot with social media to figure out how people feel about movies and new products and whatever

154
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,767
It's so common now that money and his team had already done a little test by the time I show

155
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,095
They'd run hundreds of Donald Trump's tweets through this algorithm

156
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,143
This computer program that use to find the scent

157
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,751
And then when I got there it was time for us humans to check the computer

158
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
To see how often I found the right in

159
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
Do you want to pull up bar scores

160
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
At the computer

161
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
It read this tweet

162
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
From January

163
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,319
Toyota motor said will build new plant in Baja Mex

164
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
Go to build Corolla cars for us

165
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
No way!

166
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
The caps

167
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,999
Bill plant in us or pay big border

168
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
If my gut check says that is negative

169
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
Human say negative

170
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Computers

171
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,935
Okay so the algorithm got this one right

172
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,031
He got a lot of them right we look through the list one after another after another

173
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
Almost every time

174
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
The algorithm got it right

175
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,687
And it really interesting thing about Donald Trump is stows

176
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
Does algorithms work really well

177
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:21,087
Because he uses words like bad and sad and great

178
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,671
They always mean what he means them to mean so

179
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
From that perspective he makes it really easy for

180
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Computers

181
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,791
Not subtle easy for a computer

182
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
Which means are trading Bots

183
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Botas

184
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Past the first

185
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
I was feeling pretty good

186
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
And so is mine

187
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
Yeah this is definitely doable

188
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
That was a few weeks ago

189
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,079
Describe the offices that is

190
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,639
When the real work started when I got down to making

191
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
POTUS

192
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,735
And money handed over the project to one of his programmers

193
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
A person named Camilo Jimenez

194
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,575
It started out fine

195
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,135
Emmylou did what he usually does when he's researching

196
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,951
Chatting is home office a little wood desk in his bedroom

197
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Keep it simple

198
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,559
Just my laptop coffee Notepad

199
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
Laptop notepads of coffee

200
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
Okay sometimes right Biblia

201
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
Sometimes red.

202
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Yeah

203
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
Sort of a parody of a coder

204
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,847
Except he's a physicist by training not such a classic

205
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,687
So okay so we already know that the bot can tell nice from me

206
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
What's like the next

207
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
The next thing yesterday

208
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
How to do is be able to tell

209
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
What company

210
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
Trump is tweeting about

211
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
That one sounds like relatively easy

212
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Nope

213
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,487
Does a Honda City for human

214
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
That's a half rack

215
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Computer

216
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,071
Because they

217
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
Did the text

218
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
Cooling clothes

219
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,471
Either the name of a person or the company or a product

220
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
I do have to link that

221
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Two company

222
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,407
So is is Donald Trump is saying he ate an Apple for lunch or she talking about Apple Computers correct

223
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
That's hot.

224
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
So this is what making a body

225
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Puzzle solving

226
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Over and out

227
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,111
For something like Apple stock versus Apple the food

228
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,183
We'll have to do something to train our body to tell them apart

229
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,999
So he added what's called a context

230
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
Right

231
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,143
He had her but a little but read a whole bunch of financial articles about Apple the company

232
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,519
And learn the kinds of things kind of words and phrases and topics associated with the company

233
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
Apple Cupertino Steve Jobs

234
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,639
Tim Cook iPhone exactly

235
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,247
Aha and the things that are not associated with the company but with apple the food

236
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Crunchy

237
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
Mushy

238
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Delicious

239
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
Are but might accidentally short

240
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
I actually would shorten

241
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
I think that would be a great call

242
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
I still think it's over Valentine long on food

243
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Okay powerbot

244
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
It can now tell the different one

245
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
Russ get back on task

246
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Focus

247
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,751
Focus on arbat okay our body can tell the difference between apple

248
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
The fruit

249
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
Okay right it's a big three

250
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,407
Another a few types of companies that were especially hard to deal with

251
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
One of them's were talking about

252
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Trump tweets about the media all the

253
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
But that's because he is

254
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
Commenting on the media he's not saying like I'm threatening to put some tax on news right that will affect the business

255
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
I don't like the story that was on the

256
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,327
Usually doesn't affect the stock price of a Mediacom

257
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
So Canelo decided

258
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Media companies

259
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,215
Not nurturing Universe to me because

260
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519
This is like the human decision made

261
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
Right

262
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,639
You know we we propose this thing is like what's just going to be a machine

263
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,199
But once you actually have to make

264
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
The machine

265
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
You have to

266
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
Tell the machine hottest

267
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,623
I think the machine that in this case it's not exactly thinking for itself right Camilo

268
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
Is the is a human being

269
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,767
And he is setting up a set of decisions based on his kamilos human judgement

270
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,327
Well it's it's it's a mix of his

271
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
And the computer

272
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
The machine really is making

273
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Decisions

274
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,191
It is learning about Apple

275
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
It is interpreting language

276
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
It's just that

277
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
In some places

278
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
Humans have stepped in and said

279
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
Some puzzles

280
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
They would just take way too long to solve

281
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Not worth it

282
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
For instance

283
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,271
I want to give you this one I love it there is this one company

284
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
That the body

285
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Could not record

286
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
You want to guess what it was

287
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,439
I guess I'm very excited I have give me a clue

288
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
Is very close to Donald Trump

289
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
Physically and emotionally

290
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
Is it

291
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Boeing

292
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
They make Air Force

293
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
No

294
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Here is Camilla's boss

295
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
My again

296
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
Are we

297
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,895
In our in our production hour then we won't trade the company Tiffany's

298
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:35,295
Cuz computer can't tell when Trump is talking about his daughter and when he's talking about the actual company Tiffany Trump

299
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Lesser-known Trump.

300
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
And Tiffany's the Jeweler which is just down the block

301
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
From Trump Tower

302
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
It will not trade Tiffin

303
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
Stats the decision in it

304
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Which is fine

305
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
No big deal

306
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,887
So okay our machine are Buddhist to be it can

307
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,751
Tell when the president is being positive or negative say nice things were mean things

308
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
And be

309
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
It can figure out

310
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
What companies

311
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
The president is tweeting about

312
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,711
The last thing we have to tell it is how soon after the Tweet to buy

313
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
And how long

314
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Do we hold it

315
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Okay

316
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
Okay but right away what does that mean

317
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
This is not an obvious question

318
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
So money setup

319
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
Who makes a simulation

320
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Of the stock

321
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Mark the whole stock market

322
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
In the past few months

323
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
He adds in Trump's tweet

324
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
And then

325
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,399
He runs our Bots through the

326
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,447
So it's like going back in time

327
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
To see what I would have done

328
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
If it had existed a few months

329
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
Clear our path did not exist a few months ago

330
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,663
This is not trading with your money this is just

331
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
He runs it over and over again

332
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,783
Tweaking the variable of when to buy and when to sell

333
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Each time he runs

334
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
At my desk

335
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Late for dinner

336
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
And I'm worried about that

337
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
And but I remember

338
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Sitting there and saying you know

339
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
Here are some options you know the week

340
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,447
But we could try we could try holding it overnight we could try holding it for a little while

341
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
You know what you're holding for

342
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:02,079
4 days what is simulation pointed to get in and get out relatively

343
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
But

344
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,431
Not like the exact number of minutes matter.

345
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,271
You know so that that made us feel good because that made us a like well

346
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,319
It's not going to hold this thing for 30 minutes

347
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:16,671
I'm just something magic about 30 minutes or if I hold it for 40 minutes there's something broken

348
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
It turned out that

349
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
What mattered most was

350
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
You know

351
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:25,119
Getting reasonably close to one that we happened you know in trying to get out by the end of the

352
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,911
So that is what

353
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
When Donald Trump tweets about a company

354
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Botas

355
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,591
Will buy a stock right away not in milliseconds like some high-speed train

356
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
Pretty much

357
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
It'll take like a few seconds

358
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
And then

359
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
30 minutes after that

360
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Will be out

361
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,135
The last time I talked to money

362
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
You show me the

363
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Chart

364
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,255
Show me how much money we would have made if we had lunch

365
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Right after eating

366
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
Because we did not launch them this is just

367
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,375
Pns simulations more like the ad

368
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Freibott then

369
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Okay so now I'm looking at a chart

370
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
How much money we're going to make

371
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
And what it looks like is

372
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
You flatlines

373
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
And then it shoots up really fast

374
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
Presumably I guess that's when there's a tweet and we make money

375
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,063
And then there's another Flatline for a while and it shoots up again

376
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,159
There's one that goes down others to work as a couple work goes down but

377
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
Overhaul

378
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:26,815
It looks like we are on the slow and steady path towards riches on this chart

379
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
My interpreting it right

380
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,399
You are interpreting it optimistic lyrics

381
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,215
Yes that's what I do when I'm in Bethany

382
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
I'm not a very good investor

383
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
But money said it did pass the bar for

384
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
And if it were his but

385
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
He would start trading

386
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
You know where

387
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,479
We feel good about the strategy

388
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
You know

389
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,527
And

390
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
Can you say that with a little more confidence

391
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,719
Your ear your chance you're saying it to me like she don't really believe

392
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
I want to overstate

393
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
I don't understand the risk

394
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
Overstate

395
00:14:59,327 --> 00:14:59,839
The benefit

396
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Of doing something

397
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
I just feel like

398
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
You know it's not

399
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
We haven't scientifically proven anyting

400
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
I like this guy

401
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,943
Like I respect this guy I it actually gives me more confidence

402
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
That he is

403
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
Skeptical it was like well we don't really know maybe it's

404
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
Flukey I'm that is what he saying here and like

405
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
That makes me like him more

406
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,207
What was really interesting about talking with him about strategy

407
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,047
Is it is very clearly driven by the scientific method that he wants

408
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Pose a hypothesis

409
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Contested

410
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
All of the data

411
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
He understands but that has a major limitations

412
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:42,591
Because if you wait around for the data to be just right you're going to miss a lot of opportunities absolutely true

413
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
You have just described my life

414
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
You know there's just a practical aspect of it which is you know like so

415
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,295
You know if you have this is an option you know to invest some of your money in like

416
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Doesn't seem like a good bat

417
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367

One detail of those tweets

460
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
To the computer analyzed

Figure out which were positive and which were negative

462
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,535
The most negative of all of the tweets scored by the computer

463
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
It was about

464
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
Saturday Night Live

465
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Because

00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,543
Not funny cast is terrible

Always a complete hit job

469
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
Really bad television

470
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,895
Bad

471
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
Terrible really bad

472
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223

Number two

475
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
On Tiffany's the company and Tiffany stock

476

Donald Trump's daughter

477
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,719
Is reportedly named after Tiffany's the company

478
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,487
And Trump

479
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,559
Bought the air rights over Tiffany's the store

480
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,143
Which is what enabled him to build Trump Tower as tall as it is
