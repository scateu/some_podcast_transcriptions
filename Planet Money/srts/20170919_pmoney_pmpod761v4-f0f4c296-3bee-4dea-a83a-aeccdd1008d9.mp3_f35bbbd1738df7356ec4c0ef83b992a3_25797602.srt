00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,024
Hello and welcome to planet

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,304
Alex goldmark

3
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,096
Supervising producer here

4
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:06,144
And for as long as I have worked

5
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,680
We've been getting

6
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,704
One request

7
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,240
Pretty much more than

8
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,008
All the others

9
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,544
And your emails and your tweets

10
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,824
Facebook messages

11
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
I really do re

12
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,176
There are these two words that keep coming up

13
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,456
The people really want

14
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:21,760
Basic

15
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
Income

16
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,624
The idea basic income is that the government should give citizens

17
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
A check

18
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
Every month

19
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
Just for you

20
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,208
Government gives

21
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
The citizens test

22
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,536
Not enough to make everyone rich

23
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
But enough

24
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
So that they don't

25
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,168
It's an idea that depending on who you talk to

26
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,240
Can stop poverty make the world more fair

27
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,312
But it could also make government smaller

28
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,384
And more efficient and let citizens have more freedom and dignity

29
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
Because

30
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
A basic income could replace

31
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,040
Welfare and food stamps or any number of other

32
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
Social programs

33
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
This is the kind of economic idea

34
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
Yeah that is drumming up

35
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,184
How much excitement in females

36
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,232
Because it has something for almost

37
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,768
Their supporters on the left

38
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,536
Right

39
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
They all want to see the

40
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
Try

41
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,728
But it's also one of those ideas that is just so radical that it seems like

42
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
Like I can never really

43
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,360
So when our friends at the show 99%

44
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Told us

45
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,920
They were going to visit

46
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
A country that is testing out basic income

47
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
Right now

48
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,600
And they have this great story about what it takes to get basic income to catch on

49
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
WeChat

50
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
Yeah

51
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
We want to hear that story

52
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:38,304
You don't know 99% invisible

53
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584

54
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
About design

55
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,936
And in this episode they bring us the clever design logic

56
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,264
It is behind the most exciting basic income experiment in the world

57
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,592

People all over the world

72
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
Flirting with an idea

73
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
Call Basic income

74
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,952
Basic income basic income

75
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,000
Chicken comments that each citizen

76
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,096
Receives a payment every month

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
I'm paid into

78
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Basic income

79
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,800
Also known as universal basic income or unconditional basic income

80
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
Or Ubi

81
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
That's producer Avery problem

82
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,968
Very very roughly defined Universal basic income

83
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
Is this idea

84
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,784
That a government would

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Hey

86
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
All their citizens

87
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,648
And everyone will get a flat sum of money every month

88
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
To cover their basic needs

89
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
Whether or not they have a job

90
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
And this money

91
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
Would be no strings attached

92
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
No conditions

93
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,888
And this would hopefully remove any stigma from receiving it

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
It's free money

95
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
Basically it's free money

96
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
The logic behind it is this

97
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,336
A lot of jobs don't pay enough money for people to even make rent or buy groceries

98
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,664
You can work full time and still be below the poverty line

99
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,272
It was easy to understand why people on the left would advocate for a guaranteed income

100
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,112
They're also a version of this concept is popular and Libertarians are

101
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,696
They see basic income as a way to shrink the welfare state

102
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,048
For example you could take away food stamps Medicare and housing subsidies and

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
Replace all of it with one

104
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
Flatsound

105
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:54,240
People in Tech are also interested in the concept of basic income and they feel a certain urgency about

106
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
Robots are coming for our jobs

107
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
They say and basic income is the best way for humans to maintain a decent lifestyle when our labor is increasingly

108
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
Obsolete

109
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,272
Our generation is going to have to deal with 10

110
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,856
The millions of jobs replaced by automation like self-driving cars

111
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,160
But we have the potential to do

112
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
So much more than that

113
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,256
That's Mark Zuckerberg giving a commencement speech at Harvard

114
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
And what he's getting at is in a World War

115
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
Jobs are scarce

116
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
Everyone will need

117
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Financial cushion

118
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,983
And then by his logic if people don't have to worry about food and shelter

119
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,079
Maybe they'd feel Freer to innovate maybe they'd start a new company or go back to

120
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
School

121
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:36,735
We should explore ideas like Universal basic income to make sure that everyone has a cushion to try new ideas

122
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,063
Listen to that heartbreak rap that isn't even it up

123
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,975
Elon Musk has also advocated for Ubi and the startup incubator y-combinator will soon begin its own pilot

124
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
Experiment right here in Oakland

125
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,839
Want to see what happens when I give a group of people a basic income

126
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,911
It's actually an idea that's been around for a long time

127
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,471
And there are many different variations on it

128
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
But recently

129
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
There been a number of experiments with

130
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
Forms of basic income happening around the world

131
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,199
A non-profit is running an experiment with Ubi in Kenya

132
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
And Ontario Canada just launched

133
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
The test in three different cities

134
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,831
But this recent excitement

135
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,879
About basic income experimentation

136
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
Is largely focused

137
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
On

138
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Finland

139
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,839
Experiment

140
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,679
With universal basic income

141
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Financial

142
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,591
In the beginning of 2017 The Finnish government began an experiment with a basic income

143
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,895
And this news about the Finland experiment

144
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
Was really excited

145
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,759
Maybe we will learn what people will do if they can make money

146
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
Without work

147
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
Will they just hang out at home

148
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
What Society grind to a halt

149
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
How do people find meaning in their lives

150
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
And how will they evaluate success

151
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,327
And that's of course the big question it's the kind of the Acid Test of Basic

152
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679
Will receiving basic income make people more or less

153
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
Whatever the activity

154
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Whether it's just

155
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,591
Walking around or whether it's taking care of your neighborhood

156
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Keep sore

157
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
Applying for work

158
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,175
This is Robin mocha

159
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,247
Founder of Des Moines housing cake we are helsinki-based in tank

160
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
And here's what I learned

161
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,647
Talking to ropa and other people in Finland about this experiment with basic income

162
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,719
To talk about basic income Finland started

163
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
For the understanding of

164
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
What the outcomes of Altamesa

165
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
Would be or the employment Market

166
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
The Finland experiment is

167
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
Not about robe

168
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,239
And if not to see if people will stop working when they get

169
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
Get free money

170
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,847
The experiment is to find out if giving people basic income

171
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Well actually help them

172
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Start working

173
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,759
In this whole experiment is especially interesting to us here at 99 pi

174
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
Not just for what Finland is testing

175
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
But how they are testing it

176
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
Finland is trying out a unique

177
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
Design-oriented way of

178
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
Thinking about government

179
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,279
Rather than just rolling Outlaws on a massive scale

180
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
They're trying to crap

181
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
Legislation in stages

182
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
With user feedback

183
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
Like a piece of design

184
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,031
Because every good design is made to fill a need or solve a problem

185
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
And this

186
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Is the problem

187
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
I hate it

188
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,175
To be unemployed

189
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
Right now in 2017

190
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,319
The unemployment rate in Finland is at 8.8% and that's about

191
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
Double the US unemployment

192
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:28,255
And that rate is worse than smaller finished cities like your insu

193
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,815
Is ephelides always being a Taurus

194
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Parts of the country

195
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
This is Donna leskinen

196
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,239
Resident of Yuan Su which is about an hour's drive away from the Russian border

197
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,823
She's 39 and she's been unemployed for a little over two years

198
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
Unemployment

199
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
Has been here bigger

200
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,223
That's a in southern or Western Finland

201
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
I guess we are far

202
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,391
From a bigger cities where are more much much much more

203
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
Job opportunity

204
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,535
Santa has a master's in history and she worked as a researcher until her project ran out of funding

205
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
In the US

206
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
Depending on the state

207
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,423
You can generally collect unemployment for about half a year

208
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
After losing a job

209
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,775
In Finland you can collect unemployment for about

210
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
2 years

211
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,151
And then there different kinds of social assistance isn't allowances you can apply for

212
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
If you still

213
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Don't have a job

214
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
But here's the catch

215
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
If you're collecting unemployment assistance in Finland

216
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599
You definitely cannot earn additional income

217
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,391
Or you risk losing those benefit

218
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695
And then you have to reapply

219
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
Which is a massive drag

220
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,047
It's really really difficult situation

221
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:38,143
This actually happened with the person we hired to record sauna

222
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
We asked what is rate was

223
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
And he said he couldn't charge us

224
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,591
Because he's also unemployed and would lose part of his allowance if you took on money from freelance work

225
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
So he did it for free

226
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
Thanks Jana

227
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
Basically the government of Finland realized

228
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
That something had to be done about this system

229
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,623
That they were accidentally disincentivizing citizens from getting small jobs

230
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
Or maybe even starting businesses of Their Own

231
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,231
And these are citizens who want to work

232
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Like Santa

233
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Being unemployed

234
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
Makes me feel anyway so whatever

235
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
I don't know

236
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
Unimportant

237
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,287
I mean doing a job but make you feel like you're doing something for

238
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Purpose

239
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,639
Is something bad being unemployed Chvrches

240
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
Hanging around and Chestnut

241
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,015
Being very important to anything anybody

242
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,343
So this welfare system clearly needs to

243
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,695
This could be done in a few different ways like with an earned income tax

244
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,279
But first they wanted to try out something simpler

245
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
And go from there

246
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
And this is where we get to design

247
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
They wanted to design and test policy in a process very similar to the way designers come up with new products

248
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
Design policy

249
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:53,151
Is that you would think about policies ask kind of design object

250
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Design service

251
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
And that means that you could do alteration

252
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
And tests

253
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,623
That's roping mocha again founder of the think-tank demos Helsinki

254
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
And the prime minister's office

255
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Turns to them

256
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,047
So the prime minister's office approached ask and ask them how can I be employee

257
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
Design thinking

258
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
On

259
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
A national level

260
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,191
Now can we do like governments level design team

261
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
Design thinking

262
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
It goes like this

263
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
First there is a challenge or problem that must be song

264
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
Then designers

265
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Express

266
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Cast

267
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
And cycle

268
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Express

269
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,527
That means designers come up with a few ideas and prototype

270
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Test

271
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Try those ideas out

272
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
Maybe with a model or sample

273
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
Getfeedback understand

274
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
What actually happens what are the outcomes

275
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
And cycle

276
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,071
Incorporate that feedback to make changes and revise the design

277
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
Then the process begins again

278
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
And again and again

279
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Couple years ago

280
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,287
This is how the Finnish prime minister decided he wanted to design legislation

281
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,151
So demos helped establish and experimentation unit

282
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Which is an actual office

283
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Best of The Finnish prime minister

284
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
At the prime minister's office is experimentation used

285
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
The first unit

286
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
Bus like

287
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Design

288
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
Policies in the carnival

289
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
Meaning of the word

290
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,511
There are other governments that are interested in experimentation

291
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
But here's what makes

292
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Finland different

293
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
They want to create prototypes

294
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,959
And then change and scale and update them dynamically

295
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,031
As a result of their experiments show what's effective

296
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
And what's not

297
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
And in order to run these experiments

298
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:32,223
Finland actually had to pass a law to ensure that they were not in violation of their constitution

299
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Course

300
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
All the Constitutions of

301
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
Democratic countries in the world they say that you have

302
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
How to treat people equally

303
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,951
And by definition if you're running experiments

304
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
You're not treating people equally

305
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
Cathay the people who are part of the experiments

306
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,351
I'm not being treated

307
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
So they need to be a special law

308
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,959
That's alright that's okay how do

309
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,031
The experiment fit in the Constitution

310
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
That says

311
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
That people need to be treated equally

312
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:04,479
And one of the first experiments The Finnish government decided to do was with basic income

313
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
Because the welfare office

314
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Extensive and complicated and rather than

315
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:13,439
Rejigger in one part of it and changing a bunch of stuff around and reworking their normal operations

316
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
The basic income experiment just kind of

317
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
Chugs Along on it

318
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,863
The program is currently overseen by Mario keturunan

319
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
Who works for government Institution

320
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
Called Kelly

321
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:28,031
That's his social insurance institution here in Finland

322
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,663
So I was in charge of implementing this basic income experiment or head of it

323
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Project leader

324
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,503
There's not a lot of stigma about welfare and

325
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
Everyone goes to this office every now and then in life

326
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
Because there are 40 different kinds of benefits

327
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Stockton, CA

328
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Including students

329
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,511
Support paternal care maternal care pension subsidies

330
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
And of course

331
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Unemployment

332
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,215
So in January of 2017 Keller pick mm unemployed fans at random from all over the country

333
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
In this experiment we have 2,000 people who are getting this a basic income 560 Euros per month

334
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
And so they have to be

335
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
Between 25 to 5

336
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
58 so they are not students or young people

337
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,415
And they are not those kind of people who will fill out their pension age during this experiment so this is kind of like the pro

338
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Profile of face

339
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,255
Participants didn't volunteer for the experiment

340
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,071
Killer just told them that they would now be receiving 500

341
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,351
60 Euros a month

342
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
The news came in a letter

343
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
I got an

344
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Fat fat

345
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Mail

346
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Andis

347
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,847
Said that okay you are you happy chosen to be one

348
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,431
It is basic income experiment and I was like out

349
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
What's that

350
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Sauna

351
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,295
The unemployed researcher and Yuan SU

352
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,903
Hadn't really thought about basic income until she read that big fat packet that came in the mail

353
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,695
Which outlines the experiment for her

354
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:54,047
560 Euros a month will be a little less than sign I would get on unemployment

355
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,863
But you'd also be able to work and not worry about losing it

356
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
So I was happy about it because

357
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,215
Two years that experiments last

358
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,775
It's got to be that money every month

359
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
And

360
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
I don't have

361
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,615
Stressed out much because I am a big

362
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,895
Dresser person

363
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
I stress a lot

364
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,479
Finding a job is very important to me

365
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
So now

366
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
Unable

367
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,367
If I find a job in like a part-time job

368
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
I could take it

369
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,975
And not lose the support money that usually would

370
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
If I wasn't part of the

371
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
Basic income experiment

372
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,399
Some of the participants have been talking about their basic income with the Press but

373
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
China has kept it a secret

374
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,727
I feel embarrassed about it

375
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
Biggest it feels like I have this

376
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
Advantage

377
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
So I haven't been very

378
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,199
I'm excited about spreading that information and now us

379
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Participating

380
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,527
Your purchase is like okay

381
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,879
I'm not very many people in Finland it probably hearing composite toe

382
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
I could be open to foetus

383
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,511
I'm sorry to put it this way

384
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,303
Huge in Finland sauna

385
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
Sonic doesn't know

386
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
Anyone else involved in the study

387
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
Most people in Finland own

388
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,751
Her friends get kind of StarStruck when she tells them

389
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,103
I I get people out of court with that so

390
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,431
The first one I've ever met

391
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
He's kind of

392
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Funny really

393
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:22,111
When you collect unemployment in Finland have to go to these job training meetings and check-ins every couple of months

394
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,439
But these two thousand participants scattered around the country

395
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:30,303
Don't have to do anything at all to get this 560 Euros every month

396
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,911
Even though they're part of this experiment they also don't have to report how they spent it

397
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
And at the end of the experiment

398
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,567
Keller will look and see if this group of unemployed people who got basic income took on work

399
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
And compare it

400
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
What are control group

401
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Which is

402
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,943
The rest of the unemployed people in Finland

403
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,575
175000 people who are in the same profile than these mm

404
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,695
But they are not getting this basic income so we are comparing these two groups

405
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
People

406
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
In this two years.

407
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:05,631
I see what is happening to these how are these people behaving when they get this basic income

408
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,935
And that how are these people behaving

409
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
And then when they compare the results

410
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Basic income

411
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
Dust mites

412
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,895
Get one step closer to becoming a reality

413
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Play with the idea that

414
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,271
Is basic income would actually come a universal base

415
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Peking compared in Finland

416
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
Which is kind of like the

417
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,903
Idea that I don't actually believe that

418
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,767
He's going to happen or I think there are lots of people who

419
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
I'm not thinking this is

420
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,655
It's a good idea yes the person currently overseeing the experiment for basic income

421
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Believe that won't work

422
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,007
I think that it would be true drama.

423
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,079
So we would wipe out the whole of this

424
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,431
Social security system that hate we have been building up for decades

425
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,735
And then just replace it with one

426
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Benefits

427
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,087
Children and imagines that not everyone would prefer a flat income

428
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,671
Some people do need more than one base some

429
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,023
Like what if you have children or parents with special-needs you have to take care of all day

430
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
In that case

431
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,351
You don't have the capacity to start

432
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Picking up Jaguar

433
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
The basic income wouldn't be enough

434
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
And of course

435
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,775
Who would pay for it so who would Finance it

436
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:20,127
It's really hard to say how much basic income would actually cost

437
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
The average time

438
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Hair wear it to be inside

439
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,039
And we don't quite know how it would affect the economy or inflation rates

440
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,599
It's all dependent on a number of factors

441
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
And there's no exact math on the

442
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
If someone truly

443
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
Planes that they know how much

444
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
More XP

445
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Basic income

446
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Would be

447
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
I think they're lying

448
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
It's a satchel

449
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
Systemic shift.

450
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:47,775
We decide to start paying everyone a lump sum of money will change the economy in such way that the whole system change

451
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
It's like once again something bad

452
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Experiment

453
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,943
Roper says yes basic income would save money by cutting back on bureaucracy

454
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,759
Blue probably still be expensive to fund

455
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
That's almost technical

456
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,855
You know it you know if you need money raised money

457
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
It's this like fatality

458
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,415
Do they change

459
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
By the way

460
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,231
Budgets are arranged

461
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:11,071
If basic income make citizens become more active and engaged

462
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,399
Ropa has faith that governments will find a way to pay for it

463
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,751
Because I'm excited and activated population is generally good for the economy

464
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:24,383
He says that's why they have to test before anything else if basic income would really increase productivity in

465
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
Improve General well-being

466
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
At this point they're testing to see

467
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,015
If it'd be worth more invest

468
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
I really really

469
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Really help

470
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,951
This will continue as you spread out that more people are involved

471
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
This experiment has

472
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
Invigorated sauna

473
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,631
Even though she gets slightly less money than she would on unemployment

474
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,935
She's free to do whatever she wants

475
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,983
I am trying to find a job

476
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:55,103
I meant sending you applications and take possibly a part-time job

477
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
She feels like she's about to start a new chapter

478
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
Ready for what's next

479
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
Tranquility of mind

480
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
It brought that to me

481
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,391
And if it sounds funny because the amount of money is not that big

482
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
But

483
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:12,767
Give people hope I give people a chance to take a moment

484
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
Away from that stress

485
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,375
As a panic of do we survive

486
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:23,007
It's really important to keep in mind that son is if one participant in a very small study

487
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,591
And basic income may have helped her search for part time work but

488
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,407
When I spoke with her she had yet to actually find employment

489
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,503
And also you probably know that this form of basic income is not

490
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
Universal basic income

491
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
Who are Universal

492
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,391
It would be money for every citizen employed or not

493
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
In this particular experiment

494
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,743
The basic income is only for unemployed

495
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:50,399
Yeah I think what we're experimenting that would be cold partial basic income its 8 this is a very limited

496
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
Experiment I don't know how relevant it is because

497
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
A lot of groups are missing

498
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,871
If we want to see what people do when they don't have to work anymore

499
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
Roper says they should next

500
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:05,503
See what happens if basic income is given to people who are already employed

501
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,063
To see if they then quit their jobs

502
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,439
Critics of the experiment also argue that 2000 people is too small a sample size

503
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,791
To finish Economist published an op-ed in the New York time call

504
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:24,191
Why Finland basic income experiment isn't working and said it had the potential to incentivize people to accept

505
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,751
Low pain and low productivity jobs

506
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
It's an experiment that's far from her

507
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,639
But it's not supposed to be a be-all end-all

508
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
Ideally

509
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,455
It's a first draft

510
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,503
Weekend is considered Latino

511
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Give

512
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
This amount to something else

513
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,135
And some people and then we'll know for sure it's going to be

514
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
Other experiments before we can find out how to

515
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
How to renew your social

516
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,631
Basically if this experiment is at all successful

517
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
Or even if it's not

518
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215
It should lead to another experiment

519
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,263
And then another and then another

520
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,335
In Finland isn't Justice on the experiments with basic income

521
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
Dobie experiments

522
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
For what language

523
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Esthetician schools

524
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
How to change Child Care everything

525
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
According to their website

526
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:13,599
Experimentation office is working on 26 key projects nationally

527
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
And

528
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Slowly

529
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,672
Hopefully

530
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
Finland will use the design process

531
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
To figure out

532
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
If it's possible

533
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
A worthwhile

534
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
To try radically new

535
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Ideas

536
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
Express

537
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
Test and cycle

538
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,384
Will we ever get a basic income experiment right here in the US

539
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
It turns out we already had one

540
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
Decades ago

00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,856
Universal basic income into me just seems like

556

It's not on the table at all I just feel like there's something about the US

557
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,048
That makes it so it would never happen here the basic income is basically something

558
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,864
That could only be tested in Nordic

559
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,168
Welfare state

560
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:35,264
The crazy thing about basic income is it's actually this very American

561
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
Idea

562
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
It was

563
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
First proposed rightly

564
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,360
He's kind of first mention

565
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,408
Buy American Founding Father Thomas

566
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
We've actually been down this road before

567
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
For as a nation

568
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
Here in the United States

569
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
We did some studies

570
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
With basic income

571
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
Back in the 70s

572
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
I shall ask the change

573
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
The framework of government

574
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,816
Richard Nixon wanted to see if he could guarantee a family of four

575
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,608
$1,600 a year

576
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
Like ten thousand

577
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
Today

578
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,520
Let us place a floor under the income of every family with children in America

579
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
Let us provide the means by which

580
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
More

581
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
Can help themselves

582
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:19,040
I'm so yeah and then he decided to really try and do it tens of millions of dollars

583
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
We're budgeted

584
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
So that

585
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,648
More than 8500 Americans

586
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
Could be involved in experiment

587
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
All around the country

588
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,744
And they're a bunch of different ones

589
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
And they tested like

590
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:29,792
Different variations of basic

591
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,072
Can come in different ideas around

592
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,608
And so why haven't

593
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,960
I heard of these at all well people started analyzing the results

594
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
4

595
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
And so they're like

596
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
These rumors

597
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Swirling around

598
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:47,200
Sounds that people were dropping out of the workforce and just like enjoying this basic income

599
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,760
And it wasn't actually a statistically significant

600
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
Contra

601
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,832
Kind of a Rumour which can sometimes be more

602
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Powerful than a fact

603
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,160
And they're also all these reports

604
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,464
Increase separation and divorce rates

605
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:05,120
And that was considered really scandalous and set off a lot of opposition but then when the data was actually Anna

606
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
It wasn't as large

607
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
That many more.

608
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:15,360
Is there a few but this wasn't necessarily A Bad Thing

609
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760
Exactly exactly yeah but the American public didn't have the patience for nuance and they're like this will be the end of the family

610
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,368
Tolerate it and it's all just because like

611
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,184
They started chatting about it before they had the numbers

612
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,256
You know it was kind disregarded before we really had a chance

613
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:39,936
This is Elizabeth Rhodes and she is a research director of a basic income study that is happening at wyaconda

614
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Mater research

615
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,288
And she's helping to launch a basic income experiment here in Oakland

616
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
Capri Pilots Mall

617
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,688
Group B strep test some of the logistics and preparing

618
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
For a larger randomized

619
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
Control trial that we hope to Launch.

620
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
After that local time

621
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
They want to really expended

622
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
Actually look

623
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
H22 US states

624
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
Embroidery

625
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
They

626
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,024
I definitely learned from these early experiments

627
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
2

628
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,840
Start small

629
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,144
Expand slowly and to not

630
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,424
Promise Too Much

631
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
Because

632
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
You know they want to wait for this

633
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,336
Experiment to fully play out and said he's going to run unit for several years

634
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
And so I don't expect

635
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Tootsie

636
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,712
Changes overnight in anyway and so I think

637
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,760
We really need to give it time

638
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
Sew in

639
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,112
Doing this research about basic income I come across

640
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,160
Thousand polarizing think pieces

641
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:38,560
That are either like UTIs a great idea and we should do this right now or like this is a terrible idea and we need to

642
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Stop it

643
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,144
But realistically it's going to be years

644
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,728
Before we know what we can learn from this privatized America

645
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
Can experiment

646
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
Orc from The Finnish experiment for that

647
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:55,968
No one has solid answers yet about what basic income would mean for the national tax code or inflation or unemployment

648
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,784
For the economy or the robots are happiness and well-being

649
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
And

650
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
Right now all we know is that different experimenters

651
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
All around the world

652
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,440
I'm trying to figure out some ants

653
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
We just don't know

654
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,304
So what is this is going to end like all radio stories end

655
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,680
Time will tell only time will tell

656
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,960
Time will tell

657
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Thanks Roman
