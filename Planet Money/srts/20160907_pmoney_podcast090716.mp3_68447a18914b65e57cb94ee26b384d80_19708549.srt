1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,840
Recently I was in southern Africa and

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,632
My favorite person

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,656
That I met

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:10,240
Was this Apple farmer but not any Apple farmer he was

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,080
The Apple farmer of Lesotho his name was blessing

6
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,360
My name is Blessing

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,944
His Orchard was high up on a mountain ridge in lesutu

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,320
And You Could See For Miles out of the river and the whole Capital City off in the distance

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
But I was here

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,880
To see his

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:27,648
Trees

12
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,976
The all the other farms nearby consisted of just three thing

13
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
Cows

14
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:35,072
Corn in this leafy green cabbage

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
Blessing

16
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,656
We to close some Golden Delicious

17
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
Fusion

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
Fuji Ya

19
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,008
Yes we do have the cleanest meat

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,664
Granny Smith. You have a ballast

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
Are famous

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,016
Because blessing discovered something that no one else had

23
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:58,112
In the bright sunshine and short growing season up in the mountains where he is

24
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,392
His apples

25
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,672
Ripen faster

26
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,232
He could Harvest them earlier than anyone else

27
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,816
He could sell them in neighbouring South Africa before anyone else

28
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
And so

29
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
Fable 2

30
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
Stepped into the market

31
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,448
Two to three weeks.

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,264
Oh so your apples come earlier

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,336
So you get an advantage

34
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,456
A few farmers in lesutu who exports food

35
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,272
People come from all over to learn apple farming

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,856
He even has some Open Fields where he would love to

37
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,136
To expand his Orchard

38
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
When I asked him

39
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
What's next like what are your big plans

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,744
He said this thing

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,048
That at the time did not make sense

42
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
He was going to do

43
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
What every other Farmer in the country was already doing

44
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
He was going to start to raise Ana

45
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
Inside Man trailer

46
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,568
Sectional so so you're going to get cows here

47
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
But you're

48
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,688
One of if not the best

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Apple farmer

50
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Innocent

51
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Is that right

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Instruct

53
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
On the 12th

54
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
In the country

55
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,768
And my son wants to grow more apples sure if you grows more apples will make more money be able to expand even more

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,584
But explain to me look there is a drought

57
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
And have to run irrigation over from

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
The well to The Orchards

59
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
But you don't have the money yet and if my

60
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,312
So the best apple farm in the country is going to do what every other farmers

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
Raising cattle on the side

62
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
If the drought continues

63
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
At least he'll have something

64
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
He doesn't want to take the risk

65
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Losing ever

66
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,720

68
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
Africa around the world

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
Is fear

70
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
They know what they want

71
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
They know what your payoff big

72
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
But it just seems too risky

73
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
And that is

74
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
Totally understandable

75
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,080
But if skilled people took more risks

76
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
The world could be better off

77
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,272

78
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
Fear of losing every

79
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
Two Economist have two different theories

80
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
And they put them to the test in the real world

81
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,208
Quickly getting over their head

82
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680

Built to perform

95
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
Emerging economics building

96
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
At Yale University

97
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
There is this tiny section where they talk about this

98
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104
Really big idea

99
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
Which is why do poor people

100
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Stay poor

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
One of the economist you think about this alot is Chris yuan

102
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
He's a tall guy with

103
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Gray hair

104
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
He was posted randomly

105
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,160
Back when he was young to Donna and the Beast

106
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Top math

107
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
But when you become an economist he kept returning to Ghana

108
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
A once you

109
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
Live in a place like that

110
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
And meats

111
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
People

112
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
People who are

113
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
At all this

114
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Potential

115
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,055
And weren't able to reach it because of the economic situations they were in

116
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
It just becomes impossible to study

117
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:36,223
Impossible to decorate with anything else his entire office is filled with Canadian Arctic

118
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Toys

119
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,063
Evil wears a brightly colored ghanaians shirt when he teaches

120
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,647
And Chris is particularly obsessed with this

121
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,951
One problem that he's noticed in Ghana

122
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,023
When he looks at how Farmers there are doing

123
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,423
He sees that there hasn't been a lot of progress for them over the past couple decades you look at China or India or south

124
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,727
South Asia there penalties advances in farming

125
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:03,359
Farmers are using new seeds and new techniques to grow more crops to Ghana

126
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
He looks around and it doesn't

127
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
Look much

128
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,223
Better than it did when he was back in the Peace Corps

129
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,015
There's still a lot of empty field

130
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
There's a lack of irrigation

131
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,183
And use of fertilizer remember Robert we promised you to Economist over their heads

132
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,535
Dean karlan Works across the hall from Chris in the economics Department

133
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,119
And he started a group called Innovations for poverty action

134
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:32,031
Dean travels around the world and does experiments on what kind of help for poor people works the best for poor

135
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
Penis shorter than Chrissy's ball

136
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,711
Pretty fast talker he's not a Peace Corps guy Dean's early economic education

137
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
What's 2 years as investment

138
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
I just learned enough to know what I didn't want it

139
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Which is why

140
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
All right I got to get one

141
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,743
Former investment banker and former Peace Corps volunteer walk into a room

142
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,351
To talk about the causes of rural poverty

143
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,191
And they have this very specific question about Ghana

144
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
Here's a place where farmers

145
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Could clearly grow more

146
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,639
We could invest in irrigation and in fertilizer and they could be a lot richer

147
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
So why don't they

148
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
Dean the former investment banker

149
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:17,087
Says usually when you look at it there is a simple reason why people do things

150
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
And so

151
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
They ask the farmers

152
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
What's going on here

153
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,511
The answer you get when you do that most often is money

154
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Money

155
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,559
Poor farmers

156
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Are poor

157
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
Like blessing Yabba Farmer they had these

158
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
He's Big Dreams

159
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
To do things

160
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
But they say they don't have the money

161
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
And there's no one willing to lend them

162
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:39,615
But Chris you dream who remember has spent his whole life working with these kind of farmers

163
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
He suspected it was something deeper

164
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:47,039
Because you notice that sometimes the same guy as the same farmers who said they didn't have money to

165
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
Spend on their field

166
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
Would go out and maybe buy a cow

167
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,183
Where they start a little store on the side

168
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,231
So they did have some money

169
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,839
They do not want to put all of their eggs in one basket they're going to make sure that if

170
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
Is a disaster on one field

171
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
Pick another feel

172
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,191
Worth 1

173
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,007
Growing conditions are poor for one that got another

174
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,847
It wasn't just money farmers were afraid of the risk

175
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
So this became the real question between the two economy

176
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,223
Which one which one was it which is the bigger problem

177
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
Is it that

178
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,551
These Farmers don't have enough money or

179
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
Is it the eggs in one basket problem

180
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,903
Is it fear of risk it was

181
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Economist

182
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
Versus economist

183
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Did you guys

184
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:31,071
Physically fight each other or was it just verbal screaming back and forth across the hall

185
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,167
No I don't like that

186
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
No harsh words

187
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Name-calling

188
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:44,127
I'm so sad I can't do anything

189
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
I was hoping for at the very least like

190
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,223
The caddy footnote summer

191
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Paper

192
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
But no they are

193
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:57,439
Economist this was an intellectual question to be solved in an intellectual way which is a Rand

194
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,231
Demise controlled experiment

195
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
So here's what they did

196
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:05,119
They focused on Northern Ghana which is very dry and very world is a lot of farmers

197
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,215
And if it's a handful of villages and they started trying out various solution

198
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Once a farmer

199
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Chosen randomly

200
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
Got what they asked for they got money

201
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,895
We sent them two hundred the equivalent of $250

202
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
One time one time

203
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
And did you say

204
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,527
You have to use this to

205
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,391
Putting irrigation do some of your field now there's no rules put on how they had to use it

206
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
So that was the money group

207
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,255
The risk group the risk group was harder

208
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Test because

209
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,119
Chris had to find a way to reduce the riskiness

210
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
A farming

211
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
That we couldn't control the weather

212
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
You can control insects or

213
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,031
Any other unfortunate thing that might happen out there the field

214
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
But there is a time-honored way to make something less risky

215
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,687
You probably have it yourself to make your life less stress

216
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
Insurance

217
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
In the case of the farmer's crop insurance

218
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,111
This is a concept that didn't really exist in Ghana at the

219
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,159
The country had health insurance

220
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,975
They had some forms of car and home insurance

221
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,535
But nobody wanted to provide for mnsure

222
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
If we want to do this we wouldn't have to

223
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
Make a Christian Dean insurance

224
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
You're going to have to start your own insurance

225
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Yeah

226
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,823
There's a lot of things that go into an insurance

227
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,663
There's a lot of paperwork the statistics and decide how much

228
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
They would pay out

229
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,271
And figure out when to pay out which is not an obvious thing

230
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
You don't want to pay somebody for having

231
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
Bad crops

232
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
Because then encouraged them not to

233
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
Put a lot of effort in not to get up

234
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:40,863
So they ended up facing the insurance on rainfall something that farmers can't control but is going to affect

235
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
That you can measure

236
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
If it rained too little or too much

237
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,007
The insurance policy would pay money to the farmers

238
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,567
If there was normal rainfall no payouts

239
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
Stop now. Just need Farmers to sign up for

240
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,735
Farmers in Ghana had never seen anything like this I've never seen rainfall

241
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Insurance

242
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
So

243
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
The Christian Insurance Company

244
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
8 explain what

245
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Is this

246
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Insurance NY

247
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Should you get it

248
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,791
And so if you're in Northern Ghana a couple years back say you're a farmer you getting ready to go out into the field to grab the radio

249
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
You're going to hear this

250
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
Attention-grabbing ad

251
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,543
If you happy and you know clap your hands if you're happy and you know it clap your hands

252
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,943
Any good news it is exciting interesting indeed very good news have you heard that they got agricultural Insurance Pool

253
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:33,343
Will get past come out with a new insurance policy to protect our crops animals and poultry I cannot hide my feet

254
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
I'm so happy

255
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Did that sound happy

256
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
I think he said so legit happy

257
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
Crop insurance

258
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,791
And then if you were in one of the target villages

259
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
You would then get a knock

260
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
On your door

261
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
A young researcher with Dean's group Innovations for poverty action

262
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Would smile

263
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
And would redo a script

264
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Hello

265
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
We're working with

266
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,615
The ministry of food and agriculture we recognize that

267
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
You

268
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Need help

269
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,991
Dealing with the unpredictability of

270
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Rainfall

271
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,319
This is Lindsey Shaughnessy

272
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,415
A young woman by the way who's only previous sales job was working at

273
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
Clam Box

274
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
In Ipswich where she grew up

275
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,839
Oh my God it's in the shape of a giant like takeout

276
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
Container

277
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,215
Our first year I had a lot of charts I had

278
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
30 page Scripts

279
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:28,895
Facts and figures out that this was going to be more than just getting people to sign a policy

280
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
In order for insurance to work

281
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
People need to believe in it

282
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
They need to believe in it enough to risk

283
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
More money to risk their livelihood

284
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,879
How to invest more than fart

285
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
Here's how Lindsay did

286
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,487
First off she would show people the simple economic

287
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,815
You pay us the equivalent of a couple US dollars

288
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,143
And if there isn't enough rain which is measured at a rainfall state

289
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
Then we're going to make up some of your losses

290
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
Not all of them but enough to get you

291
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
So maybe a couple hundred dollars

292
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
Not a good to the farmers

293
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
Affected sounded great to the farmers

294
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,711
Wendy started to notice the people were talking about the insurance

295
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Like it was gambling

296
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,319
Like they were gambling on next season's rainfall

297
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
When you say you give me a little money

298
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,671
And you might get a lot of money that

299
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
Seems like a lottery

300
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
And were they using the word for lottery

301
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
According to my translator yes

302
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
Which was a huge

303
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Problem

304
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
The point wasn't

305
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,495
For Farmers to pray for a drought so they win the lottery

306
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
Lindsey need a different

307
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:32,383
Lindsay wasn't a salesperson Clam Box aside

308
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,223
So it took her a long time to understand the most basic

309
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Rule of selling

310
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
Don't pitch the mind

311
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Pitch the heart

312
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
She started to put away her charts

313
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
And she just talked to these families

314
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
You would start out by saying

315
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
Can you remember a year

316
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,839
Recently in the last 20 years or so that there is a giant

317
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Flood

318
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Or drought

319
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
And they would say yes

320
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Of course

321
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:01,823
Let me tell you some story The Farmers would tell me stories about oh my goodness I can't believe

322
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:07,711
You know I couldn't feed my family this year no one could in the village and so we would say to them

323
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Okay

324
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
This would have been your payout

325
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
600 TV

326
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
These 500 CDs

327
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
And they would say

328
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
That wouldn't have been

329
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
Close to enough money to cover my loss

330
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
Sheetz I think of it

331
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,535
Like helping

332
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
Donna has government Health in

333
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
And yet no one hopes their child gets sick

334
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
So they got to pay up

335
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
Crop insurance you would say is the same thing

336
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,543
Emotional Point home

337
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Lindsey's team created a soap opera

338
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,663
On radio the told this heartbreaking story

339
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
Of a man a farmer

340
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
Who is trying to decide

341
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
If he was going to get caught

342
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,855
Play my music.

343
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
He decides not to everyone else in the field gets the insurance

344
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
And sure enough

345
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
The insurance pays off

346
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
United Jiggy alarm

347
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
You can hear them counting up the cash

348
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
Everybody in the village gets the cash

349
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
Except for our hero

350
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
And he cries for about 10 minutes

351
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
I know it seems over-the-top

352
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,967
But really when you think about it when you think about

353
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
What insurance does

354
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,111
All the shirts has that tragedy built into it like I may get in a car wreck

355
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
I may get very sick

356
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
My house might burn down

357
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,975
And so they were short of teaching people

358
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,791
Did this is the emotion behind Ensure

359
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
And

360
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
It worked

361
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Farmers rushed

362
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
To sign up for the

363
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
In fact a lot of fun

364
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,799
We expected hundreds of policies being sold and we got thousands

365
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
My first reaction was Delight

366
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
This is working this is fantastic

367
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
My second reaction was

368
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
Oh

369
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
What are we going to do

370
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
If we have to pay out all this

371
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
If it did not rain

372
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
In Northern Ghana that year

373
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,135
They would have been on the hook

374
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,695
For more money than the calculated in their Grant

375
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,255
They would have to pay at a half a million dollars

376
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,583
So they had to go to the higher-ups at Yale and say

377
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,399
If it goes bad will you lend us the money

378
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,983
And you'll said yes but we are going to take it out of your future grants

379
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,775
With our future at you

380
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,103
Which was somehow dependent on rainfall in Ghana

381
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Well yeah

382
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Now

383
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
Who's Gap right now who's gambling

384
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
So then we get these numbers everyday

385
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
No rain

386
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
No rain

387
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Sprinkle

388
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
The no rain

389
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Then

390
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Finally the clouds

391
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
Opened up not a lot

392
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
But enough to hit the rainfall tar

393
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,767
This was very good for the farmers

394
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,583
Even better for Chris and Dean Insurance Company

395
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Didn't have to pay out any money

396
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
If you would been a real company you would have made a profit

397
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
If we been real company we go tomato profit

398
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
That should say

399
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Like in any

400
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,311
Real Insurance Company

401
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,847
Not everyone was happy

402
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,151
Lindsay said after the Harvest she started to get

403
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
Calls from

404
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
Some of the farmers who didn't get a payout

405
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
And they said let me look at my crops

406
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,831
They're technically was enough rain I know that

407
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
But the Harvest is terrible

408
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,487
They told her in my opinion my Cranston do well and I really thought you'd be helping me out

409
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,815
And now I'm kind of in the Lurch and so

410
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
What that large was varied it might be

411
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
That they didn't have enough

412
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:13,055
Food to bring to Market it might be worse that they didn't have enough food to give their families

413
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
So wait what did you say back

414
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
This was how Insurance works

415
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,503
So that was always a tough conversation

416
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,575
At times like that the team had to keep reminding them self

417
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
All of this

418
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
All this insurance company stuff was

419
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
For a good reason

420
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,535
They had to act like a real insurance company in order to get the data for

421
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Four-wheel insurance

422
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,095
And finally

423
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,119
They had

424
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,727
Look at it the farmers who got cash who got the $250

425
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
They did spend more on there

426
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
They cultivated more corn they had a bigger Harvest

427
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,175
But even more interesting was the farmers who got the insurance

428
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,039
Because talking to them afterwards the researchers found that once the farmers had insurance

429
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
We would find the money to

430
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
To plant more crops

431
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,927
They would go and borrow it from their parents or their kids

432
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
They would go in on new field with different

433
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,559
Amongst the people who we had given nothing

434
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
Other than a promise

435
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Insurance Group

436
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
The Insurance Group

437
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
So they got

438
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
Literally nothing other than a piece of paper

439
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
It said that

440
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
Under certain circumstance

441
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Money

442
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
They increase the size of their fields

443
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
I invested more

444
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
Reply more fertilizer

445
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
To its remarkable

446
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
They found The Money Pit

447
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Combating that far

448
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
Same people that said they didn't have fun

449
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Yeah

450
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
So to recap

451
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
Giving Farmers money Wars

452
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,767
It leads to more investment and that leads to more crops

453
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,583
But giving them Insurance works even better

454
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,911
And insurance is way cheaper than just handing out cash

455
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
And as much as I begged

456
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Chris

457
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
To Lord this result

458
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
Over Dean

459
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
Say in your face red

460
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
They would not come

461
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,919
You're taking all the drama I know I was sucking your drama

462
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,759
I just wanted a little more soap opera Opera in the show

463
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
I died there is a soap opera

464
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,111
Are the results of a study are

465
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,135
Dramatic

466
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:07,231
Enough because insurance I think we think of this as is like

467
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Boring

468
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Financial

469
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,839
Tulane we don't think about it because it's everywhere in our lives

470
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,655
What is this really powerful tool to study shows

471
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
To motivate Behavior

472
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,031
I mean thousands of farmers doing things very differently

473
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
Out of the sheer promise

474
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,127
Of having to risk lifted off their shell

475
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,711
Right now it just has to work in the real world

476
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,551
So when the experiment was finished Chris Indian had a private insurance company take

477
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,599
Silver and so far it's been

478
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,743
Pretty slow going right it's hard to drive out all of these World farms in to sign people up and you don't have grad students

479
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
It's not catching on

480
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,583
Not yet but the market is out there

481
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
Remember blessings

482
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,423
The Fabulous Apple farmer in lesutu

483
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
I asked him about it

484
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,775
Do you have to have insurance here like crop insurance

485
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,383
No no no no

486
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Nothing

487
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
You can't buy them with sudo because it doesn't

488
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Exist

489
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,271
He said if it did exist

490
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
Are you think about buying it

491
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,927
And here's where you can see the behavioral power of insurance because when I asked him like what would you do

492
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
If you knew you had this

493
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
Protection against failing

494
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
And he's like oh

495
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
Well I wouldn't need

496
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
The cows

497
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,399
Plant this and I can grow more Apple

498
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:22,239
Here and I could put in this thing I've been wanting to do this new irrigation

499
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,823
How do we get to bring back and listen bohos for

500
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
Mitigation

501
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,991
You would drill more holes looking for more water and you could grow more trees

502
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,807
I can even leave the cat on the dead animals husband

503
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,599
And just what sticker do this

504
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
It was definitely worth

505
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,975
It would be nice to have a safety net in case the rains don't come

506
