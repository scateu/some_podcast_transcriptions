1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,048
If you happen to be in downtown Chicago

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,096
During the first week of January this year

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,656
You would have seen something incredibly strange

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,936
Hundreds of young

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:08,960
20 something

6
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:15,360
Dressed in new suits and stiff new shoes a lot of them running hits

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:21,760
Kind of amazing there sprinting down the sidewalks the city back and forth across the Chicago River

8
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,904
These are graduate students

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,184
In economics

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,976
Heading to their very first

11
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,256
Job interview

12
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:39,168
The reason the reason they're running is that the economics profession at some point decided that it was going to create

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
Job market

14
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,472
Unlike any other

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,848
Every University or company that wants to hire professional Economist has come here to Chicago for the weekend

16
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:51,200
Every employer set up in a different hotel room in hotels all across

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968
The city

18
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,808
And then every graduate student who wants a job has to show up

19
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:00,416
They try to interview for as many jobs as they can over the next three days

20
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
It's like speed dating

21
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
For cannabis

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,792
And sometimes you got to run to the next interview

23
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,584
I think you're aware like

24
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
4 minutes late

25
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,984
Search for an extra 30 seconds

26
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,288
Mexican Taxi

27
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,104

From one of the best schools in the country University of Michigan

32
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,320
If you were in any other academic fields

33
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,416
You would be wined and dined by employers right now

34
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Not running down the street

35
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
I'm at the right Hotel this is good

36
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
Joints about to happen

37
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,120
The first real job interview of his life

38
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
You check to make sure a suit looks

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
Did you know how to tie a tie

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,032
I've got no type. Clearly I don't know how to type

41

And I'm Adrian ma Adrian is a producer at WNYC brought this story and the reason why

46
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:15,168
Finding the perfect job we all know this waste a lot of time and a lot of money

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,240
And you hate wasting time and money

48
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Economy

49
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,848

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,128
Be creative Market

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664

Economist decided to create a job market for themselves

72
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
I thought of every

73
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
And they started with scale

74
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,992

At the American economic Association

76
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
So they knew all the big players in economics

77
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,648
Would already be around

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
But

79
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,256
Doing a conference and a job market at the same time

80
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,096
Means that they need thousands and thousands of cheap hotel rooms

81
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,680
You don't think that's really cheap and has almost no tourists

82
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
Chicago

83
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
In the first week of January

84
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
I woke up my first morning in Chicago

85
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
And I heard this already

86
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
Looks like front is 3 degrees windchill

87
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432

88
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,456

00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
Julian shoe was already there early

91
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
First day

92
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136

Julian standout in the crowd of Economist he has a huge smiley outgoing

94
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
He makes eye contact when he talks to you

95
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,119
It is not a coincidence that

96
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,167
He was actually the only graduate students

97
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
It agreed to be followed around by us

98
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239

99
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263

What

101
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,383
He also says he's having these anxiety dreams about the inner

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Movies that are coming

103
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,735
In my nightmare my interviewers ask me a question and I just

104
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
Have no response

105
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
How long is the silence last

106
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
Am I Dreaming eternity

107
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
Julian does not have

108
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
An eternity to waste

109
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
He has more than 20 interviews already scheduled for the next

110
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Read it

111
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,399
He's applied to universities

112
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679

00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
Bye

117
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
The government

118
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
He loves

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431

00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
Dataset people have a lot of numbers

121
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271
So he applied to work at of course

122
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
The treasury Department

123
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,463
And he's not the only one there about 1,800 other grad students just like Julian going for the same job

124
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:23,071
Pretty sweet jobs at that starting salary is usually above $100,000 a year

125
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
Restart router

126
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
First stop

127
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
Embassy Suites across the river

128
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
You ain't long underwear

129
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
Are you I am

130
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,663
Apparently called a walk across a couple lengths traffic

131
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Over the bridge

132
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,967
Everything calm

133
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,319

Wyndham Grand that will take 15 minutes max minimum of 13 minutes

Are you free walk I free walk today

137
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:00,959
We make it to the Embassy Suites on time but we hit something that Julien did not plan for

138
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
The lobby is mop

139
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,335
The bunch of other grad students all try to make their 9 a.m. slot

140
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Elevator

141
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
We wait for the next one

142
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
Julia uses this moment to get into the zone

143
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,575
His first interview is with the University of Oklahoma

144
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
University of Okla

145
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,719
What is this this is my crib sheet for University of Oklahoma so I kind of know who they are

146
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:28,863
Jehoiakim is into metric so if he ask me question I should give a pretty metrics the answer which means math

147
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,263
Not the answer I hear about it says it's a small Peach defense Maltese deprogrammed invasive

148
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031

149
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,871

150
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Good luck

Thanks

152
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
Proud moments

153
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Julian heads-up

154
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
The hotel room alone

155
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:51,903
And there he will find faculty members of the economics Department of the University of Oklahoma

156
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
We didn't tell Julian

157
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
But we met one of them last

158
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
Hi my name is Gary Hoover

159
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,095
I'm the charity economics department at the University of Oklahoma

160
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
Took an idea of what the interview

161
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,447
Will look like he shows us around his

162
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
His hotel room is a hotel suite

163
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Actually there is a couch

164
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,847
So I dropped her today won't have to sit on the bed although

165
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
That does occasionally happen

166
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
He says pretty soon the room will start getting filled with coffee cups

167
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
Snack wrappers

168
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,039
The interview was basically don't leave the room for days

169
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
It's interview after interview after

170
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
Interview do they get to do anything else with the conference

171
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Sleep

172
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
And no

173
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
Hooper's looking for someone like Julian

174
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
Somebody who can work with big data

175
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
But also has the

176
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,911
People skills to teach undergrad

177
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
Uber doesn't necessarily get

178
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
His first

179
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Pic of John Kennedy

180
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
It's because this is a job market

181
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,615
As an employer he does not have all the power

182
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,711
Because there's a bunch of other schools were also trying to nap the best people

183
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,551
Speakers at the University of Oklahoma may not be the most

184
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,367
Prestigious economics Department Of The Nation but you know

185
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
Here at the job market

186
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,719
He's in the same kind of hotel room at Harvard is

187
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,255
An MIT in Princeton

188
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
And if I can ask an intelligent question

189
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
And

190
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
AT-AT shows you

191
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,215
These guys are serious Economist this serious scholar

192
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,799
That you might have thought well now they're in a Cow Town and

193
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
We can impress to

194
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,663
Uber says this is one of the best things about the econjobmarket

195
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
In the old days

196
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
The top students

197
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Automatic

198
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Glee went to the tops

199
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
But clearance

200
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Chicago

201
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
Cheap and easy for everyone

202
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Take a chance

203
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,183
Yeah universities can gamble on an untraditional candy

204
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,463
They might not have looked at

205
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,255
Students can check out a

206
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Account

207
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
That they might not have considered visit

208
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,143
This is us into the conversation

209
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,959
In theory that's what's going on inside the hotel room

210
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,751
Everyone's trying to impress each other

211
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,591
And when Julian gets out of the University of Oklahoma interview

212
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
50 am

213
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
We want to ask him

214
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
How'd it go you first meet interview

215
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
But already is eyes have that sort of

216
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Reveal

217
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,367
He's got a pen interview with University of Pennsylvania at the Wyndham Hotel

218
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
Battletag

219
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,695
30 minutes so I'm already late

220
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,279
Okay time for the play-by-play

221
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,071
Thread his way through the streets of Chicago

222
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,655
He's already looked at the route to a fast walk to a jog

223
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,495
We hit Michigan Avenue at full speed and then boom

224
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,823
Don't want some did not plan for the car

225
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:26,271
Turn it to make up time to jog starts to become a Sprint the dude is running full album

226
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,087
You got to leave me behind

227
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
I had to stop running

228
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
I had to stop running in Julian take off

229
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,559
It is calling him I am barely hanging on

230
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,215
We get to the hotel push through the revolving doors about 5 minutes late and it shoots directly into the elevator

231
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Funny horn

232
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Jo-Ann's gone upstairs

233
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
Catch My Breath

234
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,223
Got a coffee and then Robert you finally walk in

235
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
I already have a job

236
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
I do not need to run through the streets of Chicago

237
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,671
Half an hour later your heart rate has returned to normal

238
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
But when Julian comes back down

239
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,327
He seems more rattled than winning winning

240
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,935
When do they cut you off so like you're supposed to have a 15-minute saying ready to go

241
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
Yeah I finished overall summary

242
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,519
So they're like 13 minutes

243
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,079
The details afterwards and then I doubt we don't hear that that's like

244
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
At work by

245
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
But I have to say

246
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
The good thing about the schedule that I know

247
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
Is that there is no.

248
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Time

249
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
To replay the Batmobile

250
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
There is always

251
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Another interview

252
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,415
Factors one at 11

253
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,279
At the Fairmont Hotel should be an easy walk

254
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
32 Stetson

255
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
Actually I'm not sure

256
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:51,775
Give me some amazing that this is designed as a perfect job market because in the moment it seems like so

257
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Many

258
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
Things can go wrong

259
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,895
In fact when we were hanging out the conference cuz

260
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:03,295
We're not going to follow Julian all day long everyone there has been through this process at some point and they all have these

261
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
Horror stories

262
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
About what can happen

263
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
Rental professor at Cornell

264
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
Is John Colley

265
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
And he told us about the time

266
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,071
The job market was in Philly to Philadelphia for 5 years ago got hit with

267
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,887
Big snow storm and people just could not get in

268
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:23,775
And so yeah there's job Kenny to just could not interview and think of it from the perspective of the poor graduate students

269
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
I mean there's been some of the six

270
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
Years preparing for this one

271
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Weekend

272
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
And then

273
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Anything

274
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,503
So we had one job candidate we interviewed

275
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
And she got laryngitis

276
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,879
And so she was able to get through our interview just barely be could barely understand her

277
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Cancel a whole bunch of other interview

278
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,255
By the way Callie says they interviewed her over Skype later

279
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
And they gave her a job

280
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Stop & Shop

281
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
But I'm telling you you serve

282
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
1

283
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
Tray of bad clams

284
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
At the econometrics reception

285
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,799
And all the sudden you could lose the entire next generation of economist

286
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
Yeah okay but

287
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
Join wasn't going to a lot of these

288
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Perceptions

289
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,759
He says he was basically subsisting off bread

290
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Peanut butter

291
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
Spent the whole weekend interviewing and

292
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,159
And I have to say like we wanted to see what

293
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
Actual interview

294
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,791
Look like we called a lot of people trying to get into the route

295
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,607
Behind the locked door to see how it actually went down but

296
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Lisa Bonet

297
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:27,007
Stupid these are make-or-break career moments they didn't really want someone to the microphone inside

298
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Except

299
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
University of

300
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
University Baptist so cool

301
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
If you ain't go with it

302
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
So are we

303
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
This is where the magic happens

304
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
What would you describe as is the ideal sort of place and maybe

305
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
Does Memphis V Adder or not

306
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,743
Setting there multiple ways to answer that question so I'll start with what do I want

307
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
Out of my PhD

308
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,095
For hotel room someone has been living in for 4 days

309
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,911
Place seems pretty professional for an interview

310
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,007
Joanne sitting in a chair in front of for professors who are all lined up in front of him

311
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Couch

312
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:04,127
Labor Economist and I use a variety of different estimation

313
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Quantitative

314
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,663
Techniques

315
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,479
I understand different sorts of aspects of

316
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,503
Economics Magic

317
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
You know I have to say

318
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
I was pleasantly surprised

319
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
The guy is

320
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
Smooth

321
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,255
He was great he did a great job you have some good questions you remember everyone's name

322
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
It was pretty flowers

323
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,351
Rap-up

324
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Pleasure to meet all of you

325
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:32,543
After Julian leaves we stick around for just a few minutes and one of the professors gym in spear

326
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
He great he said Julian was great

327
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,383
Maybe

328
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Even tube

329
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,271
There is an irony involved in a candidate doing really well in the interview

330
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,343
Who also has very good recommendations like Julian

331
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,183
And that we're also evaluating whether we can get this person

332
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,279
Until we have we have had some Canada to we say man they if they were really good

333
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,375
And Eminem or not sure we can get them now because they're really good

334
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,215
And I'm not going to say Julian in that category but that is that is one thing that comes with

335
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Somebody doing a really

336
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
Great interview

337
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,663
Are we might end up saying well I think they're going to go to a better school then then I serve more prestigious School than us

338
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:15,551
Usually a school offer to fly three of the best candidates the interview to the campus 2

339
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
Woo them in a second round of interviews

340
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,927
But the schools do not want to waste those offers

341
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
On people who would never take

342
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Take a job

343
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
It's like dating

344
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
You think about asking somebody out

345
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Part of that mental calculation is

346
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
Is this person going to say yes

347
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:34,751
Yeah maybe you don't ask out the hottest person in the bar because you assume that they are out of your league

348
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
Baby nobody asked that person

349
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
Which is why we have so many lonely soup

350
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,223
It's actually a real problem that happened in the econjobmarket not too long ago

351
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,551
I kind of noticed that a lot of really great candidates like Julian

352
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,855
We're getting offers even though they Easter interview

353
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,695
The only thing that Economist loves more than a perfect Market

354
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,279
Is finding the one flaw in an otherwise perfect

355
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Chick Market

356
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
Economist

357
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
This is the national Economist convention

358
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,471
The best Minds in economics were recruited

359
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,031
Figure out what was going wrong one of those mine

360
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Alvin Roth

361
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,383
He won a Nobel Prize for his work

362
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,711
On Market design he developed the way organ donors are matched

363
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
Patience this guy is a legend

364
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
He says

365
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,575
The problem boils down to this

366
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,879
Fundamental economic Concepts

367
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,183
Decentralized markets where

368
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
You have to evaluate people in a Time

369
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
Consuming way suffer from

370
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Congestion

371
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Congestion

372
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,631
The Economist job market made it so easy to apply for

373
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
Jobs that a lot of people were applying to places

374
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
They had no interest in

375
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
They would never go to

376
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Pachulia

377
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
We told Rob that Julian applied to

378
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Deafness

379
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
250 jobs

380
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,783
Okay that's a big number it's not unheard of obviously but

381
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,111
But lots of people apply to 100 job so it's not an extraordinary

382
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,159
With so many applicants

383
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Clogging the market

384
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
How do you know which ones are ready to commit

385
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
Rough came up with an elegant

386
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,351
He didn't want to crack down and limit the number.

387
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Applications

388
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,983
Instead he came up with a plan to add a little bit of extra information

389
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Into the sea

390
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,079
The American economic Association now runs a website

391
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
To which before the interviews

392
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
AR

393
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Formalized

394
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,479
Candidates can send up to 2

395
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Signals of Entry

396
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
And like a wink

397
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,855
It's like a wink and you can only send two wings

398
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
And they warn you

399
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,719
Don't waste one of your Winks on Harvard

400
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
Everyone wants to wink at Harvard

401
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
I think of an employer that hold a special place in your heart

402
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,167
A place you wouldn't mind going if you don't get into Harvard

403
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,471
Now that sounds like a small tweet

404
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
To the system

405
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
But it made all the difference

406
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,335
Now schools could look through the hundreds of application

407
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
See if there was someone who

408
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Really love

409
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Just in case

410
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
That doesn't work out

411
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
Rock also helped develop this

412
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,575
Kind of safety net for applicants who don't get any job

413
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
If I the spring they're still looking for a match

414
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
Bingo online

415
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
And see who still hiring

416
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:08,095
NFL this week's the number of successful job matches went up now 97% of people who go through this

417
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Speed dating race

418
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
Find a job by the

419
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,007
We should say Julian did not wink at the University of Memphis

420
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
They probably got the message

421
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
That she wasn't really into

422
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
You know he did wake up

423
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
US Census Bureau

424
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
The man loves a good dataset

425
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
It is Sunday afternoon

426
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
And Julian shoe fits

427
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Finally.

428
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,415
He collapses into a chair in the lobby

429
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
22 interviews

430
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
In

431
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
Three and a half days

432
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
The last interviews with Amazon

433
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
They're hiring a ton of Economist these days

434
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,191
Chewing pulls up a huge bag of Amazon swaggin

435
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
Come sit on the table

436
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
He is exhausted

437
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,287
He's got a blister from a noose

438
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
My foot hurts

439
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
I know your radio show but

440
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
You can't see this

441
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
But

442
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,991
Basically I have a cut on my right eye we do not need

443
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Need to see that

444
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
22in

445
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,623
22 interview Julian is gone on more interviews

446
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
In one weekend

447
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
Did I think I've gone on in my entire life

448
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Yeah and

449
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
Chewing himself is a little different

450
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
When we first met him at the beginning of the weekend he was like

451
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,863
Raring to go

452
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Confidence

453
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,215
And he said his strategy was basically to get as many job offers.

454
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
Now he seems

455
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
Little more philosophical

456
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
Because sometimes

457
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,663
It's just you figuring out that you don't want this job

458
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,967
Or this job doesn't want you because

459
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
You're just not a good fit

460
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,087
And I think managing that expectation is really in Port

461
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
After a workout

462
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
And both people get all that was great

463
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
Like that's good

464
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:44,095
You leave interview everyone goes all that was bad that's also good because you agreed that this was not

465
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
Something that you want to do

466
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,727
Everyone we talked to say Julia know he's going to be snatched

467
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,335
I honestly expected that by the time we had flown back to New York City

468
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,151
Julian would be calling us about his job offer

469
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
Spot

470
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,223
It did not go down that way

471
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:06,111
Something was about to throw the economics job market into turmoil

472
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,951
It was much worse than a snowstorm or tree of bad clams

473
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Coming up after this

474
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,655
Support for Planet Money and the following message come from Wonder

475
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:25,055
Allowing individuals to invest in solar projects earn up to 8.5% annual

Under capital.com Planet Money

478
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,999
We kept checking in with Juliana see how is going and pretty quickly he got

479
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
Offers for second-round interview

480
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,327
Few places even flew him out

481
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,887
University of Oklahoma brought him to campus week

482
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
We can meet the faculty

483
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,959
Took him out to a nice Italian dinner

484
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
But then

485
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
The market dried up

486
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,335
15 days after we saw Julian Chicago

487
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
The new president of the United States

488
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
Donald Trump

489
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
Butterfree

490
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,199
On all federal hiring

491
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
And you may remember this Julian

492
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,295
Had been counting on working in government

493
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
Here in Chicago with the

494
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,135
Treasury Department Federal Trade Commission

495
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
He said his special

496
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
Secret Love wink

497
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,487
The Census Bureau

498
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
And they all said to him hey

499
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
We just can't hire anyone

500
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
And I thought hum

501
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
That's not well-timed

502
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
By the end of February he still didn't have a job offer

503
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
Insight as I continue waiting

504
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
Waiting waiting waiting

505
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:33,663
And the backs my meth in the back of my head I'm still

506
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Freaking out

507
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,247
Julie says he mostly stayed in his house

508
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
In Ann Arbor

509
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Reading Game of Thrones

510
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Made it up the book

511
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
Four five

512
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,951
He didn't want to go to the university and have to face everyone

513
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,767
Around this time other people had me getting job offers

514
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
I just didn't really want to

515
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Talk to anyone

516
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,887
And I think

517
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,167
They have a job

518
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,959
I don't have a job

519
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
All right

520
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
And so

521
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
Julian out of necessity had to go back

522
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
To the old fashioned

523
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
Less efficient way of getting a job

524
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
He had the network

525
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,271
You been talking on and off with someone from the

526
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
The College Board

527
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,575
That's the company that runs the S8

528
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,159
And the College Board wasn't in Chicago this year

529
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,976
But they did have an opening for an economist

530
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
And Julian work disconnection

531
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,096
It's letters of recommendation were sent and in March

532
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,632
Julian.

533
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
The phone call

534
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
He was offered a job

535
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
As an economist

536
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
In the Philadelphia office of

537
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,056
The college board so you missed me last night

538
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
So I was

539
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,128
Jumping around instead of screaming

540
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
Right it's like this

541
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
Is the psychiatrist really excited

542
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,880
I feel like we should have seen this coming like that this is one of those romantic comedies

543
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,208
Where the hero is doing all this dating online but then

544
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Of course

545
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
At the end

546
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Finds his soulmate

547
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
You know

548
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:54,816
Pet Supermarket

549
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
The nerdy friend

550
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,168
Yeah it was the nerdy friend all along it

551
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
The College Board

552
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
It's

553
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
Tempting to try and draw some lessons

554
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Right

555
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
But Julian is an economist
