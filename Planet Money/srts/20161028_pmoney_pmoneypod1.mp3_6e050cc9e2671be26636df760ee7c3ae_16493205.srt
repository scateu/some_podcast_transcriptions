1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,376
A couple weeks ago we did a show about the massive banking scandal at Wells Fargo

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:08,960
How good employees were pushed to do some Very Bad Things

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,728
Like

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,008
Open up bank accounts

5
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,032
The customers Nebraska

6
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:18,432
And after the show aired we talked to ex employees who said you know what that fraud the wrong doing the stuff was going on

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,712
That's only

8
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,248
Because

9
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:25,088
What happened at Wells Fargo is still haunting many of us even

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
Years after

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,416
One of these ex-employees was

12
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,232
Jeremy he worked at a Wells Fargo branch in LA

13
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,256
Pekin 2008

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,304
He just wanted to move on with his life

15
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,960
I probably applied to every major Bank out there from Bank of America Washington Mutual Wachovia

16
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,520
It was a stressful time this is 2080

17
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,056
The world economy was collapsing

18
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,080
His wife was pregnant

19
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,384
And Jeremy wasn't making any progress

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,224
Until he got a lead on a banking job up in Silicon Valley

21
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
So I drove up to San Francisco I left about 3 a.m.

22
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
And made it up there in time for the interview

23
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,416
Forget me with this guy really nice guy

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,976
And you said listen man

25
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,024
You're exactly what we're looking for

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,048
You got the drive

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
Motivation

28
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
You know you know the industry

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
Let's go ahead and let's

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
Go through the formalities

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Get y'all on the job

32
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
I've got so excited call to my wife

33
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
Looks like we're moving to San Francisco

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,152
Alright next day feels that some forms for the HR department

35
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
Check a few things

36
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
Xiaomi wait a couple of days

37
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
Wait a couple more days

38
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
Doesn't he

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,344
After about a week

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Finally game

41
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,440
The HR lady at Collins at 8 just want to follow up

42
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
See what's going on in the process she said

43
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,792
I'm sorry we went with another candidate

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
I just sat there hung up the phone

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
I thought to myself

46
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
I thought I had this job what happen

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Jeremy found out the answer

48
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
To this question

49
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
Just a few weeks

50
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
After another interview

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
A different bag

52
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
The hiring manager truck

53
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Jeremy by the arm

54
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
And put him outside

55
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
And she says listen

56
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,624
I'm not really supposed to say anything because it's an HR issue but I'll tell you

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
I really liked you but apparently there was a blemish on your on your securities licenses that

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
HR says that we can't hire you

59
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,888
She said was on a document called a u v

60
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
This is a form in the banking in

61
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,008
Essentially it is a report card from all your former employers

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
And journey

63
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
Jamaican even know it

64
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,152
And yet someone had written something on there that made him on Hiram

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
And I said what the heck is it

66
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Cuz I don't know I

67
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
That's all I was told by HR

68
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,344
But Jeremy was pretty sure he knew who wrote the comic

69
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
It was his former employer Wells Fargo

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,976
This moment right here has been playing out all across the

71
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
Country we've talked to former Wells Fargo employees

72
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
Florida New Jersey

73
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,608
Pennsylvania Los Angeles San Francisco

74
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
They all say the same thing

75
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
They say they pushed back again

76
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
Get the crazy sales culture at Wells Fargo

77
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,824
And retribution the back of Mark them with a Scarlet Letter

78
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
And that's really hurt their careers

79
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
Hello and welcome to Planet Money on Robert Smith

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
And I'm Chris Arnold

81
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:05,344
Prudential we continue our investigation into the third largest bank in the country into Wells Fargo

82
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,720
And we go deep into this mysterious document that Jeremy found out about it's called the u v

83
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,304
I'll tell you where it came from a Wells Fargo branded their workers with it

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
And how hard it's been

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
For people like Jeremy to fight back

86
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:23,008

Sorry Chris I'm holding in my hand

99
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
The document

100
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
That ruined Jeremy's

101
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
It's called the u v and

102
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
For something that is incredibly powerful

103
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,616
Can be incredibly destructive

104
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Check out how boring

105
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
Looks pretty innocuous unless it's like something you fill out at the DMV is 24 pages of boxes and lines a little star

106
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,904
At the top here at that Jeremy's full name he only wants to use his first name cuz he doesn't want to

107
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
His career to be hurt even more

108
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:19,839
Before we reveal what was written on this u5 we wanted to tell you how the document how do you find was

109
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
Supposed to be

110
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Because

111
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Believe it or not

112
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
Bu5 had good intent

113
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
Right and Banking and investment

114
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,335
It's a little bit like the wild west mean someone would take your money

115
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,407
And you have to trust that they wouldn't run off with your life savings

116
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,735
And there weren't a lot of people out there enforcing the

117
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
But we found one of them

118
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,087
One of these early investment-banking Sheriff's

119
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
He even has the voice of Ash

120
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,231
My name is Tom Krebs and I'm a Securities attorney in Birmingham Alabama

121
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
Were You There When the form known as the

122
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
The u v was born

123
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
Yes

124
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
You were there

125
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
IWatch

126
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
This was in the late 1970s

127
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
Tom was working for the Alabama State

128
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Securities Commission

129
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,639
Is the people responsible for keeping an eye on all the stockbrokers and investment folks in Alabama

130
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,479
Back in these days there was a big salad reliable bags and invest

131
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
But there were also a lot of Conures

132
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,087
Boiler room so you got some

133
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,927
Office in New Jersey with a bunch of crooks selling bogus Investments over the

134
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,023
Then wasn't a bad guy there were a heck of a lot of bed

135
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
There were

136
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,119
Boiler rooms operating

137
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,191
All over the country they were oil and gas salesman

138
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
Dumping

139
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:34,591
Fraction 1 divided working interest on Alabama and I don't understand what that is but it sounds bad

140
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
Who is

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
Fraction 1 divided working entry

142
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,319
Basically it was part ownership in an oil well

143
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,159
If people would hop these as investment opportunities over the phone

144
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,999
We put one salesman in jail for having sold

145
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,815
Entrance to a widow in Montgomery Alabama

146
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
4 of 13 and 1/2 foot well

147
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,959
And my guess is there wasn't much oil down 13 and a half feet

148
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,031
That it was nothing but still texts and

149
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
You do not mess with

150
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
Tom crabs

151
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
Alabama State

152
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
You do not but Tom fell

153
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
That when they shut down one scam

154
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,575
His power only went so far the people working the phones

155
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
They move to another state

156
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,135
You start dying again

157
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,975
The problem was that there was no Central Point

158
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Where

159
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,047
A person could call

160
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:32,447
And determine whether or not the person on the other end of the phone from them was indeed a licensed security salesperson

161
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,311
So Tom and the other state investment cops developed a computerized reporting system

162
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Central place 2

163
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,895
Keep track of the con man in the Dodger bankers

164
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
Are they required legitimate investment firms in bag

165
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,319
X22 make a note if they fired somebody if the employee was involved in

166
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Broader

167
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Was being investigated

168
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,951
That would get written down to that boring form that we were just looking at

169
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Do you fart

170
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
What's up with the letter u

171
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,583
Avenue5 does you stand for something

172
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Uniform

173
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
Uniform

174
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,447
And was there a you one two three four

175
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,311
There is a u4 and I think there is a you free I'm not certain about wanting to

176
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,151
So this new system it was uniform standard

177
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Tom says it's a lot of

178
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
And make sure the conman couldn't just hop from company to

179
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
The company

180
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
Bank-to-bank

181
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
And it wasn't just for investment

182
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
All bags could use this database

183
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,975
They could fill out a little note on a Troublesome or maybe a dishonest

184
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Employee

185
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:33,631
Not every employee to back by the way has to have a u v but the ones that handle Investments do and there's a lot of them

186
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,215
And the next man could just check out the u5 before they hire someone

187
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
Read with the last bank wrote and make the decision

188
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,615
Essentially it set up a system whereby the banks were policing themselves

189
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,687
It saved us a lot of time and a lot of resources

190
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
So

191
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
This is the way it was supposed to work

192
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,343
A simple reporting tool for good Banks

193
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Stop bad employees

194
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,695
What happens when the bank itself

195
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Becomes the problem

196
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Panera Bread manager

197
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,327
This is what we're hearing happened at Wells Fargo

198
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,167
Bu5 became a weapon away to threaten and punish employees

199
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,751
Read it if you remember our last podcast we were following this

200
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
Former Wells Fargo employment Ashley

201
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
And

202
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
If she didn't mean to sales go

203
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Call so they call him

204
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Solutions

205
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,199
Two managers would take her into a back room

206
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
Lock the door

207
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
And a teller

208
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
If you don't meet your Solutions you will be

209
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
Fired and it's going to be on your

210
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
Permanent record

211
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
I mean it was real like you were

212
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,999
Stuck in it was

213
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,863
The feeling that no other employer is going to watch you because we will

214
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Ruined you

215
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,543
Ashley to know if they were exaggerating at the time but later she found out that they weren't joking around she was fired

216
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,871
We help your track. Are you 5 and right there on her you five

217
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
It says quote failed

218
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
To perform

219
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Job duties

220
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
She said that makes

221
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
If it sound like she

222
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Do I work

223
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,855
And she hasn't been able to get a job at a bank

224
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Fence

225
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,415
She's working for 12 bucks

226
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
An hour

227
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
And you know even employees who were

228
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Being yourself

229
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,351
How do you say that Wells Fargo was using the you five against them too

230
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,167
Jeremy the employee we heard from at the beginning of the show

231
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
Louisiana jobs

232
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:17,055
He says that his Wells Fargo Bank branch was kicking ass they were doing great

233
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
And he was being rewarded

234
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
And I can tell you one time

235
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,735
I got invited to go to a Lakers game

236
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,039
And we'll smother Branch management

237
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
The district manager

238
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,671
Couple of the branch manager just sat down next to me and said how are you guys getting yourselves

239
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
What is your secret

240
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,743
So I broke it down for

241
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:40,095
I said here's what it is there's a lot of people are rats that are doing some shady things

242
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,471
That is hitting your sales numbers by giving customers credit cards or checking accounts that they never asked for

243
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,543
In the bag that was called gaming your salesman

244
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
And everybody in the branch

245
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
You about this

246
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,175
But this was Jeremy's chances are what was going on with

247
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
Opera Mini

248
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
Tell the truth

249
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
I told that the other manager is

250
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
Including the district manager about

251
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
The gaming that was going on and how I didn't

252
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
I didn't approve of it I didn't like it

253
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,767
That was kind of a pivotal moment for me where I realized something was kind of weird going on

254
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
I spoke too much

255
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,607
It got back to my to my manager

256
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Annie's like buddy

257
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
What's going on here

258
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,447
My Bankers don't game

259
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
You know this

260
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,031
Thanks. Got a cold and awkward

261
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
For Jeremy

262
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
In the office right after

263
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
His manager

264
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
One day

265
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Pull them over

266
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,503
And get them on the phone with the district manager and makes him take back everything he said.

267
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
Basically told me

268
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Lifeline

269
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Life on

270
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
Jeremy kept complaining

271
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,511
Though he called the company's ethics line setup to the

272
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Detect fraud

273
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
But nothing happened

274
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
2000's called into his manager

275
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Jeremy said he was told basically

276
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
He could quit

277
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,543
Or the bank was going to open an investigation into

278
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
Weather ckp

279
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
Apple account without their

280
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
There's a good chance that that happened

281
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
He be fired

282
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,015
So anyway I went to lunch and came back and I said

283
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
No I'm out of here

284
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
I'm done

285
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,599
Jeremy walks out of bank

286
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,927
Totally confident that he's going to get another job but of course

287
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
He does not he's turned out time

288
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
And time and time again

289
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,607
That woman tells him there's a problem with your document a problem with your youth Ivan all of a sudden

290
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
The whole thing comes back

291
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,215
You have to call up Wells Fargo his former employer

292
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
And say hey

293
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Send me a copy of that

294
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:30,175
I finally received the overnight mail I open it up and when I read what they wrote on there

295
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,575
I couldn't believe it might how is shocked they had blatantly lied on my new 5 saying that I am

296
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,975
Admitted to opening up fraudulent accounts I didn't open a present at the counts I was the one saying that this is

297
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
What's going on

298
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
And so

299
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:51,679
If that's what it hit me when I read this for the first time that they were retaliating against me for what I

300
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Lighted

301
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
To be clear

302
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,567
We don't know if Jeremy opened accounts for customers who didn't want them

303
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
He said he didn't

304
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
The back put on music

305
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Do 5:30 did

306
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
We don't know if the bank is retaliating against Jeremy for

307
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
Blowing whistle or if it actually had a good cause to fire him

308
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
This right here is

309
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
The point of this whole story

310
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
We don't know what really happened

311
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,975
Because the u v is not set up like a

312
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
The court of law

313
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
We're both sides

314
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,815
Tell their story and a judge decides

315
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
At the banks

316
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
Have almost all the power

317
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
They don't have to show any evidence

318
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
It's just there were

319
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
The back does have to send a copy to the

320
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Employee

321
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,127
But that can be after it's all done and written and the worker doesn't have any say

322
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Jamie says

323
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
In his case

324
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
He did not eat

325
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
Even see his u5

326
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Is the backside of the Rock address

327
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
So how do you fight this whole thing

328
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Jeremy look

329
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
And he was

330
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,903
Blown Away by how much it was going to cost

331
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,303
The lawyers Wanted chart Panda $20,000 retainer and there is no guarantee that anything was going to be fair

332
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,143
Text it was just merely to get them to say okay I'll work for you

333
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
Doesn't mean anything will be done

334
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,031
What you want to challenge that you 5 you are stuck in their system

335
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
With their rule

336
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Foo Fighters run by an organization

337
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Spinraza

338
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
AP financial industry regular

339
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
Latorre Authority

340
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,759
Which sounds like a government organization right but

341
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
It is not

342
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Finra is an industry group

343
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,623
With Executives from Financial firms running the play

344
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,695
On their board we talked to a recruiter who works her bags

345
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
And we showed her Jeremy's case

346
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
And she said basically he's out of luck

347
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
If you really thought that he had a case

348
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
You should pay whatever it takes

349
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
Free lawyer because no one

350
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
We going to hire him with this Market

351
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,751
There may be one other way for

352
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
He's in contact with a lawyer

353
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Please bring me a Class Act

354
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Action lawsuit

355
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
On behalf of former Wells Fargo employees

356
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
Detroit his name is Jonathan delshad

357
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
A lot of the employees at call me

358
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,087
The one thing they're asking me for it looked my u5

359
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
Will you call the bank and report card

360
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,719
Is it possible through your lawsuit to get my u5 cleaned up

361
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
Cuz that's what I care about the most

362
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,631
Play some jobs in other Industries but they put they wanted to do Bank Nevada career in banking

363
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,495
We wanted to see what the industry had to say about all this so I called up finra

364
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
The organization

365
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
Runs that you five

366
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
System

367
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:11,711
And I was asking them look I mean we're hearing about this from all these workers who say they can't get rehired and it seems like a really big problem

368
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
Are you guys doing anything about this

369
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
And

370
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
Today they actually told me something new

371
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
They said

372
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
We are doing so

373
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,671
About this we started a review

374
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,743
Of the u5 forms that were filed by Wells Fargo

375
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
Your so they're taking another look at the

376
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
They wouldn't give you a lot of details that wouldn't say

377
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
How many workers

378
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
For how long a period of time

379
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
But they're taking another look

380
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
And this could be a big deal

381
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,543
We have also been calling Wells Fargo

382
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
For their side of

383
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
Dory and they provide a statement to us

384
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
It said quote

385
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
It's disturbing to hear claims of

386
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Retaliation against

387
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Team members

388
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
The bank says it to vet

389
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
Getting those claims in the bank also says

390
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,367
If assisting former employees to be rehired

391
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
When possible

392
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,463
And as for Jeremy the guy with the blemish on his you five

393
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
He actually found

394
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
A workaround

395
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,839
And what he discovered was in consumer banking where

396
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
He'd been working

397
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
They would always check it

398
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
By putting business bag

399
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
Helping out small businesses open

400
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
Right

401
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
He heard

402
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
Often they won't check the

403
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,407
So we reach acordes resume scored another interview

404
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Anixter

405
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:20,831
I need a job I got the job and I was set to go and so

406
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
So far so good

407
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
He's moving up in the banking world

408
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
You making more money

409
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Success

410
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,999
But Jeremy still works

411
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,815
There's this bad comment from Wells Fargo it's still there

412
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
Like a landmine

413
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
How does u v

414
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911

I try not to think about it be honest with you

416
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,223
Scares the crap out of me I can everything that I've worked for these past eight years can be taken away from me because of this

417
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,623
This planet because of this lie because of this this one statement that Wells Fargo in

418
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,463
Put on there Wells Fargo has apologized for a lot of things

419
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,767
They have not yet talked about what happen

420
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
Open to their ex employees after they left a couple

421
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,911
And Jeremy and his other employees we talked to they all say the backhoe is it today

422
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,983
To get this career-ending stain off the Record
