1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,048
This is pretty clear to me this

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:02,816
6

3
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,632
This is planet money Kenny Malone

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,168
This one looks bad to

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,704
But I think that's a for iMac

6
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:14,080
We're looking at a big circle on a computer screen that kind of looks like a bunch of Dippin Dots

7
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,896
And there is a number in the middle and a different color

8
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,736
Yep I literally can't see anything there

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,784
Circle of Dippin Dots has a light

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
Gray

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832
An inside

12
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
There is

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648
The number 6

14
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,720
Burgundy red

15
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,000
Dippin Dots

16
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,280
Start

17
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,352
It starts all the way here

18
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,400
Kenny and I have known each other for almost

19
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:42,496
Was 10 years we used to work together in Miami very colorful place

20
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,800
And I just found out that Kenny

21
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,592
Cannot see

22
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,616
Certain

23
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
Colors

24
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:52,480
He's one of about 300 million other people on the planet who have

25
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
Some form of

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
Color deficient

27
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,112
And medical world they've been studying colorblindness for

28
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,648
Centuries trying to find

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,928
Some cure

30
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
It was

31
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,048
Successful in a male squirrel monkey but not in humans yet

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
Color is

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,656
Super complicated Kenny is literally missing a

34
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
Apart of his eye

35
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,216
That allows us

36
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
To see certain

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Colors

38
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
But

39
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
Recently

40
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,360
Like a lot of people I've been noticing these

41
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
Videos

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
There videos of

43
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
People with color blindness

44
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
All of a sudden

45
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
Perceiving

46
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
Color

47
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,600
Little old ladies who've gone their whole lives

Sing the world in Black

49
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416

All

54
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
The colors

55
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,864
I feel like I'm in heaven

56
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912
Oh my goodness down there

57
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704

Strollers

62
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:01,600
Lionsgate films gave a bunch of kids with color blindness a pair of these glasses to watch the latest

Brighter they wanted in on this

69
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,008
And you might think that the medical industry spent years

70
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
Trying to solve this and finally did it on schedule

71
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
But

72
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,664
That is not what happened

Frontier

74
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
Because that's

75
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
Not how inventions 10 to work

76
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,576
The guy who gave children the gift of color

We're going to tell the story of one accidental inventions Miracle glasses to see if

90

Concrete hallway in Berkeley California

Chemistry

129
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
As a kid

130
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,567
Don used to wonder why humans would

131
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Speak to dolphins in

132
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,919
Human why we were in speaking to them

Endorphin

134
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
So

135
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
Would you consider yourself

136
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,807
A hippie

137
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
No

138
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
No

I think you have 50 Tendencies this is Nebraska I might

140
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,279
Not a Berkeley no Berkeley hippies different

00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,119
Story of how Dawn stumbled into the color blindness in

142
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Industry start in the 90

143
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Remember

144
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
He's a glass sign

145
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
And at the time

146
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,567
He was trying to solve a completely different problem that was happening

147
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
In operator

148
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:40,735
Surgeons who are using a certain laser had to wear this big orange shield in front of their face

149
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Protect their eyes

150
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
The orange tent

151
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,391
Didn't block the laser but it also made everything else

152
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Really hard to see

153
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
Insurgent hated it cuz they couldn't see anything

154
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Everything looks Orange

155
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,095
Okay wait hold on what do you mean they couldn't

156
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:01,471
See anything for certain well if you put an orange filter in front of your eye

157
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Then everything looks Orange

158
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
Green looks Orange

159
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,615
Yellow looks orange red looks aren't so they are trying to do surgery

160
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
And they couldn't tell the difference between bones

161
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
And tendons and tissue and blood

162
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Lisa can see it

163
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:19,391
So it made they had to sort of rely on their their deep understanding of physiology 2

164
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,439
The do the work that sounds

165
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,279
Terrifying the top dollar

166
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
Sudan experiment

167
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
With other glass colors

168
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
Any created a pair of glasses that still block the laser butt

169
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,983
Allowed surgeons to see what they were actually

170
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Operating on

171
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
That was

172
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
An intentional invention

173
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
Not an accident

174
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
But these glasses

175
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
It looks kind of cool

176
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,223
Kind of work is sunglasses so

177
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
The surgeons and Don start wearing them Outdoors

178
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,367
And one day Dawn is playing ultimate Frisbee with his friend

179
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
They're in Santa Fe

180
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Light Breeze

181
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
And the fields

182
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
AR

183
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,119
Just a carpet of green bright green a pair of his surgery glasses as Sun

184
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
And his buddy Mike is like

185
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
Hey

186
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
To borrow those

187
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
What's the mon

188
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:12,895
And what the hell makes like dude when do those cones get there what are you talkin about Mike

189
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Sure enough

190
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,759
There were a bunch of fluorescent orange cones marking off the playing field

191
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
But Mike

192
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
Had never seen orange before

193
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,623
It looked Brown to him

194
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
So did Green

195
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,487
Until he put on these operating room glasses

196
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,559
Sing orange was an accidental side of

197
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
And Dawn

198
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
John was like

199
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
This is amazing

200
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
He became obsessed with

201
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Figuring out

202
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Houses

203
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,823
What is going on here what have I stumbled onto

204
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,383
Pete stumbled onto a problem

205
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
1 and 12 men and 1 in 200

206
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
And I'm thinking I can help

207
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,831
Kenny Malone and all these other people

208
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
Ensure the glasses

209
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
Accidentally helped Mike's

210
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
The orange but no one wants to just

211
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,791
See orange I want to taste the color rainbow Man

212
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
So Dawn goes back to

213
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
To the lab to find the right

214
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
Color mix

215
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
Don't get funding from the national in

216
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Institute of Health

217
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Perfect his magic

218
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
Glasses

219
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
And he goes and he finds himself a business

220
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,663
Andy Schneider real brainy mathematician and former

221
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Dancer

222
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
My

223
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
Passion was actually

224
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
What they call Ariel dance which was

225
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,135
Flying through the air like on like ropes and cables and stuff like that

226
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
Yuan Dairyland

227
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
Yes--go the aerialist yeah

228
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,047
I have an image of Andy that's hard to get out of my mind

229
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
Half-dressed

230
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Perched on a pier

231
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
In the bay

232
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
It's part of a performance

233
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
At Twilight is that all right

234
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Yeah

235
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Yeah

236
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,407
You didn't think Donald partner with some regular old basic mathematician right

237
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
Andy and Don

238
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,479
The math guy in the glass guy

239
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:57,599
Make a computer model of a color deficient I so that they can test different Filter Company

240
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,671
Still like the stop sign looks Brown at a field

241
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
Now it looks red

242
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Good

243
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,047
Oh but now that filter made the grass look

244
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,887
Tinker with a filter 1 filter

245
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
That is just been tinkered with and tinkered with to make sure that as many colors as you possibly can look like the color that they're supposed

246
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
What the luck

247
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,895
That's absolutely correct finding the Perfect Blend

248
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Took years

249
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
They're partnering with universities using clean room conditions running out of government funding doing clinical studies

250
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
+ 9

251
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
Years of research later

252
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Andy and Don

253
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
The ugliest

254
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
Pair of octagonal shape

255
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Glass

256
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
Sunglasses

257
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
The lens is really small

258
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,911
We'll put them in these tiny little friends

259
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
We could see through it

260
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
It worked

261
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,031
Rolling your eyes they're so

262
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Heinously unattractive

263
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Like

264
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,127
What you'd wear if you just had

265
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,223
Cataract surgery whatever it was a product it had a name

266
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
They called it

267
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Enchroma

268
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Means with

269
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Color

270
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,623
Andy came up with that and then he regretted it

271
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,183
Later he said it should have been two syllables not three

272
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
Why it's like a trending

273
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,119
Can Celexa Valley Facebook Google....

274
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
What are you going to do

275
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
They make a much more attractive

276
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
Iframe website

277
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
Chroma is officially on the market.

278
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
Andy our psyche

279
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
And

280
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
No one's buying

281
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
It was difficult

282
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Absolutely

283
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:32,063
Apparently it's hard to convince people to spend money on something they can't

284
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,647
See liked by this it'll give you purple and

285
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
I think you're really going to want to see purple

286
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
People saying well I don't need those

287
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,791
Because I've lived my whole life

288
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
Without them

289
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,095
And

290
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
I would be honest

291
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
That is exactly how I feel about these

292
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:51,007
Glasses I cannot imagine that whatever I've been missing out on

293
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Is worth

294
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,823
349

295
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Dollars

296
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
And they were actually more expensive when they first

297
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
Came out

298
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:03,039
I should say that these glasses only work on people with certain kinds of color blindness

299
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,879
Give me you've never seen The Color Purple you don't know how much

300
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Purple is worth

301
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,487
I suspected it is less than $349

302
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
People like Kenny

303
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
They are not believers

304
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
And this happens to inventors because

305
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,959
They invented something it's a completely new product

306
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,007
Yeah completely new category

307
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,823
And people are not necessarily going to believe

308
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
It's going to do the thing you say it

309
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,991
This happened with the Xerox machine all these men were like we already have typist

310
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,807
They're called women why would we need this machine it took

311
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:41,695
The wives of these men to be like ya know this will actually save us a bunch of time just trust us on this

312
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
It's not enough to just

313
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Produce a miracle

314
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,815
Product every new product needs a big boy

315
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Ford on that Big Break

316
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Came in the

317
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
The Forum

318
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
A balloon

319
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,007
One employee adding chroma had this great idea

320
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,079
To put deflated balloons in each box

321
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Of colorblind glasses

322
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,455
People start blowing these balloons up and filming their loved ones

323
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,759
Seeing color for the first time

324
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
When I saw it I was like

325
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
I had nothing to do with it

326
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
But I was just like

327
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:14,207
Oh my God that's a world-class ideas so simple

328
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
Sarah has been sending me these videos

329
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
The sheer joy of seeing people see color for the first time it really like it makes you

330
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
Give these glasses as a gift

331
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,639
To anyone you know who is colorblind

332
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:39,039
Blue jeans

333
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,903
People could now see the glasses working the social proof

334
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,463
Lynch's the message the videos go

335
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Viral

336
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
And people

337
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
Start buying

338
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,071
Oh my God

339
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
Is this Goosebumps

340
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
From head to toe like the whole thing two

341
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Because I had never

342
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:02,335
Thought that this was going to happen I mean it's just came out of the blue accidental invention

343
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
Found people

344
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Panini

345
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,967
And so many of the things that we have in the world happened

346
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
Just like this

347
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
Totally randomly and

348
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
By accident

349
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
The Pacemakers

350
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
Smoke detectors

351
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
Potato chips

352
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
So

353
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Of course

354
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
Companies

355
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
Poor millions of dollars into trying

356
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Force

357
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
The next great accent

358
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,423
They are trying to manufacture Serendipity serendipity

359
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,799
A word that in itself was a bit of an accidental invention coined in the 1700

360
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:39,199
By some guy who was obsessed with this Persian fairy tale about three princes killed in the

361
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,759
The art of detection in a land

362
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,319
Called Serendip

363
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
After the break

364
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
We go

365
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Serendip

366
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,023
And also I obviously got can you pair these glasses

00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
How do you do it

382
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
We took that question

383
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
The authority

384
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
On accidental

385
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Inventors

386
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Taken Canada

387
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
So what who am I talking to mine as a pagan

388
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Yes

389
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
I have to ask you about your name

390
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,391
Name Pagan came from high school Rebellion

391
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,487
Yeah her principal kept mentioning God In School she

392
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
She protested

393
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
A lot

394
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
And my friend nicknamed me pagan

395
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,447
Pagan used to have a column in the New York Times called who made that

396
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
Book about serendipitous inventions at one point

397
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
Stevens analysis and found

398
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
The 50% of patent

399
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
In Europe

400
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
Based on accident

401
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,711
And there's one inventor who taught her a lot about how they

402
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,295
Lonnie Johnson dr. Lonnie Johnson

403
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,415
He actually was a NASA engineer in the 80s was working on a water-powered

404
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
Playing with all these different nozzles

405
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
And he noticed

406
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
One of those

407
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
When the water went through it

408
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Like

409
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,167
Flew out in this very cartoony way and kind of

410
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
Splattered against the wall

411
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
Very

412
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Toilet

413
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
And this is

414
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
Similar to your inventor

415
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,127
He fell in love

416
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
What he saw

417
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:52,319
The NASA engineer spent the next nine years demoing this at toy fairs looking for anyone who

418
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Would see what

419
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
He sign it

420
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
A super

421
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,463
Stoker a high-powered

422
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Squirt gun

423
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:05,631
The Super Soaker 50 from Laramie

424
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
Of accidental inventions story

425
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Sure

426
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,751
Finding your funny nozzle is a big moment

427
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
What people do not focus on

428
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
Is the years and years

429
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Of time

430
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
And money and obsession

431
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,175
It took to finally get the suit

432
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Super Soaker in

433
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:24,575
Spigen says just look at the greatest discoveries in science we know how they came about

434
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,647
Giving people lots and lots of money

435
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
And just try things

436
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,279
For years and years and years and years without expecting

437
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Results

438
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,959
But as you can imagine people aren't really comfortable with unlimited money and time waiting for me

439
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
To happen so

440
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Sears

441
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,567
All this enthusiasm right now and check in at

442
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
Demian

443
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Science

444
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,663
To try to make employees

445
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
More prone

446
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
Do good acts

447
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Stuff about

448
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,855
Should your screen be exactly this shade of red or blue

449
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
What kind of desk

450
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
Size would make people most

451
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
What's creative

452
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Should the death

453
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,023
Have three seats added or two seats

454
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
She doesn't know why but there's

455
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Currently an obsession with

456
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,143
Staircases at Big universities like

457
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
Serendipity causing staircases

458
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,727
Very very

459
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:20,127
Fancy staircases that in themselves cost billions of dollars that are supposed to make you bump into other

460
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Pagan wants to

461
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Take down

462
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
The staircase

463
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,271
I mean you know this is just

464
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
Hype and silliness

465
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,879
If you decide I want Mary from

466
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
Engineering to mingle

467
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,231
From with Bob in chemistry

468
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
And I'm going to make

469
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,351
A $3000000 staircase where they can bump into each

470
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,679
You are actually making the surroundings

471
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Less

472
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Serendipity

473
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
You have decided

474
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
The way in your mind

475
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
I'd discovery

476
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Happen

477
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,639
But you are wrong

478
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Because

479
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,943
Accidental

480
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,759
Discovery is going to be something you can't imagine

481
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,343
It's going to be something completely unexpected and weird

482
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,647
And it'll likely happen in a cup

483
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
Completely unrelated

484
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
And probably because of some chance encounter

485
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,815
Like Don's colorblind friend

486
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
If he didn't happen to have a

487
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,167
Colorblind friend on that Frisbee field

488
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
She would have never noticed

489
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
The Accidental side effect of

490
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Sturgeon glass

491
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Megan says

492
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
If you're looking to create xidan

493
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
You need diverse

494
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
The more diverse

495
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Kinds of pie

496
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
People you bring in

497
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,391
What they can observe in the world like what kind of accidents they can have and learn from is going to be really

498
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
Much more of a spectrum

499
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:44,351
Being the believer in Miracles that I am I got Kenny a pair of these

500
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
Miracle glasses and I have determined

501
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
Kenny is going to

502
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,215
To fall in love

503
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,799
With purple Gonzalez is a force of nature

504
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,591
And you will not stop her from putting glass

505
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,431
I grabbed my inflated balloons and dry candy to a place with

506
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
The whole lot of colors

507
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,527
A carousel there's actually one right across the street

508
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,295
For my building

509
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
This will be the place where

510
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Hayneedle

511
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Covers

512
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,935
Oh my seatbelt

513
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Baidu

514
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
Everybody

515
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
I'm calling off this carousel

516
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,295
Are you ready

517
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Where they go

518
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
Today Show was produced by Sally helm

519
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
Oh my God

520
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,767
Broadcast super green

521
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
Look at the trash cans are so pretty

522
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:54,495
That's amazing the blue that's like this is baby blue and that's like royal blue

523
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,055
It's so beautiful I couldn't tell the difference in the past

524
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
It's like a whole different color

525
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,151
Alex goldmark is our supervising producer

526
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:07,295
Her dress purple dress is purple and pink

527
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,111
Special things to the Tennessee Department of Treasury

Development

529
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,487
They're breaking these lenses up and installing them and viewfinders around the state

530
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,279
So that color blind people

531
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Can experience

532
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
The Fallen

533
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:19,839
Spring colors

534
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,679
This is amazing I want to show you my favorite flower

535
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
Because I think

536
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
I think you're really going to like it now that you could be purple

537
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
Red balloon

538
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
Is that what people call fuchsia

539
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,807
What is happening editor is Bryant or sad

540
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
Pink plus purple

541
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
That was tricky

542
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Orange smoothie

543
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,023
Blue trash can

544
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,095
Yelling colors
