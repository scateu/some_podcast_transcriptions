Just so you know this podcast include some foul line

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,320
And it was originally reported back in 2015

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
11 update at the end

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
Frederick Hutson had this

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928
Entrepreneurial

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,720
Pretty much from the day he was

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,840
In high school he had a lawn mowing business where he got other kids actually mow the lawns

13
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,376
You did the same thing

14
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,912
With a car washing business

15
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,704
The guy was Annette

16
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,520
He went to the Air Force boots Las Vegas

17
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,312
Starting a window tinting business

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,360
And then he bought a mailing center

19
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,200
One of those off brand UPS kind of stores in Las Vegas

20
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,480
And this store

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,552
Was key to his biggest business plan yet

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,112
He was going to deliver marijuana

23
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,928
All over the country using UPS

24
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
And feta

25
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,744
What could go wrong what could go wrong

26
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,328
I'm at the mail center and I'm just sitting behind the counter

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
And then I see

28
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
It's like all glass

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,472
And then I see agent coming from both sides about 12 people

30
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
Bra size in inches

31
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
All like Rush the Dora

32
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Like a gun drawing

33
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,872
So they they they put me in cuffs

34
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,432
And then they come in if you could have charged more

35
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,712
Sotto voce

36
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,760
Frederick got nailed for conspiracy to

37
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
Distribute marijuana

38
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,064
5 years

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,088
Federal Prison

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
Now some guys go to prison

41
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
NBA finals

42
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
Some guys go to prison and they work out a lot

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
Massive biceps

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,792
Remember Frederick Hudson was

45
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
The business

46
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,864
So he would spend all this time

47
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
In the prison Library

48
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
Writing

49
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Business plan

50
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:49,312
So I just spent every day writing random whatever I did even if it was even

51
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Possible feasible

52
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
I'll just write a plan for it I would write how it went to build it I would write who I want to hire I meant White Collar guy

53
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,088
And I would be children how to write Financial models and we would get

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
Paper taken together

55
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
White people like that

56
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,328
Rulers and draw lines make a spreadsheet for hand like physical paper spreadsheet

57
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,400
So it was a tedious process but I have time to do it

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
Entrepreneurs do right he pick a problem and figure out a solution

59
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
But as the days went on

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,176
Frederick realize the biggest problems that need solving we're actually all around

61
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
Inside this jail

62
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
Look at from a business perspective

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Prison

64
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112
Was actually an unexploited gold

65
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,208
All water Planet Money Robert Smith and I'm Steve hen

66
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,792
Today on the show a business man goes to prison

67
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
It decides he is going to disrupt the largest

68
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
Captive Market in the world

69
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,264
This message comes from NPR sponsor Capital One

70
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Capital One is reimagining banking I offering accounts with no fees or minimums that can be opened from anywhere

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
In 5 minutes Capital One

72
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
What's in your wallet

73
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Capital One na

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
When you're doing time in a federal prison there is no

75
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
Shortage of business

76
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Problems

77
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,208
Frederick Hudson saw them everywhere

78
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Every

79
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,304
Day the first thing you notice in prison is there is

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
No competition

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
You want to buy soap there is only one place to get it

82
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,936
Prison commissary

83
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,544
And it is way overpriced I looked up a price list online for federal prison

84
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
A Pepsi

85
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
Can of Pepsi cost $2

86
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
And $0.60

87
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
Ofertas that's nothing

88
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
Compared to the pay phone

89
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:37,600
Gas can charge whatever they want if you want to make a call from jail there's just one phone company to deal with

90
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,440
Basically when I was going to county jail I was making calls

91
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,328
Out but it was expensive was going to point where Tanya who's my girlfriend the time she was like I can't afford every time you call me $50

92
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
So I stopped calling as much

93
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,936
Whatever time you called her was $50

94
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,008
How long were you talking right we talked I think I called you like 15 minutes

95
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,616
And what reason why cost for 15 minutes for $50

96
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Very expensive

97
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,920
The phones are address

98
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
But the thing that really drove Frederick nuts

99
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
What's this

100
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
Photo Pro

101
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,832
He wanted his girlfriend to send him a photo

102
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:15,488
But inmates aren't allowed to have cell phones or internet access so for his girlfriend to actually send him her picture

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
She have to go and print it out at a drugstore

104
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
Put it in an envelope and mail it to the prison

105
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
And that

106
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Didn't

107
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,287
One of the main things that I used to be jealous I was ovulating my bum and I will hear mail call

108
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
And

109
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
Dell called me

110
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
My name is never called

111
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
And it's just frustrating cuz I never get mad

112
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
Fertilizer on his bunk mulling over

113
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,319
And then it goes to the library with his blank pieces of paper and pencils

114
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
And he starts thinking about the

115
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
Photo problem like a businessman

116
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
What if there were a company that could make

117
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
This whole photo thing easier

118
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,583
A website or an app some technology that would allow someone to

119
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Take a picture

120
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
Hit a button

121
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,471
And then poof that printed photo would automatically get sent by mail to prison

122
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
How much Shutterfly

123
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,335
For contacts so this whole idea basically started because

124
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,943
Girlfriend naked pictures

125
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
Well you can't get naked pictures in prison

126
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,063
But you know the more risque the bar happy you are you know yeah

127
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Forget pot delivery

128
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,951
This was going to be his perfectly legal million-dollar idea

129
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
He even came up with a name for

130
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
Got a 2010 name picture

131
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Picture

132
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,423
There wasn't much he could do about building picture Graham while he was still behind bars

133
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,239
But we got out in September of 2011

134
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,055
He brought all those business plans he had developed

135
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
All this paper spreadsheet

136
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
Smart blinds

137
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,919
And she headed out for

138
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,735
Okay normally if your Tech entrepreneur

139
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
You go to Silicon Valley

140
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
But Frederick

141
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Was not

142
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
He was

143
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
The Felon out on parole

144
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,879
His destination

145
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
What's a halfway house

146
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
In Tampa floor

147
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,279
Adherent Outlet you couldn't imagine a worse place to incubate a Tek com

148
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
At this halfway house every aspect of his life with control

149
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
He didn't have the luxury of uninterrupted time

150
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Prison Library

151
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Get to constantly check in or check out

152
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
And it kept saying

153
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
You have to get a job

154
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
And no

155
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
Starting your own company

156
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
That doesn't count

157
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,223
So we started build picture Graham on the slide

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,015
Initially is playing with the hierarchy

159
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
Couple guys website

160
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Photos

161
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Three causes photo processing

162
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,767
And he said but you know we'll be such a butt call with the CEO and other people so they need to just call my first conference call

163
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
Still living in a halfway house

164
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,911
And how do you take how do you take a conference call in a halfway house

165
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
So they had a rule which is stupid but

166
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,055
Then you can have phone they didn't let you have a cell phone so I stick my phone in and

167
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
I'll be in my bunk laying to the side and on the conference call with the CEO and the sales guy

168
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
And basic

169
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Pigeon

170
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,063
And in your doing this while laying on a bunk

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,647
Speaking quietly in a halfway house probably

172
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Eight other people

173
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
And if so

174
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
How did you how did you make that pitch it actually came out because I told him I say I'm looking to send pictures they wasn't

175
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
That you know this already

176
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
What you going to do that's different

177
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
I said well we're going after Ma

178
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
And is really no service that allowed

179
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,127
People send photos to inmates and we can be the first

180
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,687
And we're going to be the best cuz we have unique way to ask

181
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
System

182
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
We have a way to Market to

183
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,063
And then you say why do you know this is oportun exist

184
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
What am I going to tell him

185
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,183
Cuz I'm worried that he's going to say no if he knows that I've been in prison

186
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:34,399
So I take the leap and I and I tell him I said well actually I know because I did four years in federal prison almost five years in federal prison

187
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,703
Distribution of marijuana in a pharmacist

188
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
So I'm not I don't know which way is going to go

189
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
NCO said you know what

190
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
Is most interesting that I've heard

191
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
Let's do it I'm excited about it

192
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,759
Forgetting a printer guy on board was just one of a bunch of problems

193
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,039
Frederick needed to solve

194
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,367
Give me to figure out how we can get out of the halfway house and

195
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Start a business

196
00:07:55,391 --> 00:08:01,535
You weren't supposed to be doing this and this problem of finding investors I mean that pitch may work for the printer guys but winter going

197
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
For people who want to give you

198
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
You money

199
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,655
Saying I just spent the last five years behind bars is perhaps

200
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
Not the best

201
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Right

202
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,287
Topher can one advantage he had a good friend from the airport

203
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
The guy named Alphonso Brooks who lived in Tampa

204
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Like them

205
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
And wanted to work with him

206
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,223
So they decided to found this business together

207
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
They start asking friends and family

208
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
For money like

209
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
Like a couple thousand dollars here a couple thousand dollars there

210
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
And then Alfonso actually hires

211
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,255
Frederick officially he gives Frederick a job

212
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:36,095
It just happens to be a job at this company their founding together

213
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Picture graph

214
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
So they have a seed money

215
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
Jack just you know some of it

216
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,775
They have the technology the printer guys are stats

217
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Jack

218
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
And at least

219
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
Technically he's obeying all the rules

220
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Of the halfway

221
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
Technically yes

222
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Check

223
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
But of course

224
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
This is really only half the battle right

225
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,671
He spent all this time trying to overcome the barriers

226
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,255
That being a convicted felon threw up in his path

227
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,095
But he still faces all the classic problems every other entrepreneur faces

228
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:08,863
That's right like

229
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
How do I reach my costume

230
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
How are they going to pay

231
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
The people want this

232
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,031
Will it work will hear the answers in just a moment

233
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,127
Support for Planet Money and the following message come from ishares

234
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Because the best

235
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
Preparation for tomorrow

236
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,503
It's building for your future today

237
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
Ishares by BlackRock

238
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
Inspired to build

239
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:33,439
After everything Fritter custody been through it was time to Launch

240
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
The business

241
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,023
In 2012 they build the website

242
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,631
And they just need customers but finding customers is not easy because

243
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
The customers he wants

244
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
Or in prison

245
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
They have to reach prisoners

246
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,335
So what they come up with a pretty low-tech advertising salute

247
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
They made

248
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
A picture postcard that they mailed out to

249
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
500 inmates

250
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,759
A list of inmates that they found on the internet

251
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Bi copy was pretty

252
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,671
We said someone wants to send you a picture gram and

253
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,255
To have him send it to you go to this website and that was it

254
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,071
Some of these postcards had a picture of a mom

255
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Cooking dinner

256
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,119
Some had pictures of kids

257
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,935
Some pictures of attractive women

258
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:20,799
But every postcard offered one free picture sent through the mail if their loved ones

259
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
Set up an

260
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
So basically it's just junk mail

261
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
Yeah it's absolutely

262
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Junk mail

263
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Standard junk mail

264
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
And you got to think for a second

265
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
What we take for this junk mail

266
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
To actually be a

267
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:38,207
I mean a prisoner has to get it after we did not throw it out in the prisoner has to like

268
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
Wait in line to make a phone call

269
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,351
Call their loved one say hey here here's this website go to this website explain the

270
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Whole process

271
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,471
And then that person the relative has to go online

272
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Actually send a photo

273
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
Normal piece of junk mail gets a response

274
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Like one person

275
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,175
That's what he said that 500 postcards you can expect maybe 5 p

276
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,199
Keep all to respond

277
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,527
But remember Frederick Hudson knew something most people don't

278
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Inmates

279
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
Love

280
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,391
Male all of a sudden like to 3 days later

281
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,207
All these orders started coming and people start saving photos

282
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,279
Out of that first batch of 500 postcards

283
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
135

284
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Paying customer

285
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
The response was just

286
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Nuts

287
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
And it was the sort of Revelation 4

288
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,567
For Frederick because how long he been thinking about prisoners in the

289
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,663
Problems of being in prison any thought of this website as a service for in

290
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
But at least artists he's responsible thought

291
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
No of course like the real customers are the families

292
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
And all these responses there are mothers

293
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
And father

294
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
Brothers and sisters

295
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
And it means as much

296
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
For them to be able to send a photo

297
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
As it means for inmates

298
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
To get that

299
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
I talked with some of the relatives who used

300
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
And it's actually pretty heartbreaking

301
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,495
How much they value just the tiniest bit

302
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
A contact

303
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
Yvonne hydrovac

304
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,871
Live in st. Petersburg Florida and her son Johnny

305
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
He is doing a 15-year stretch

306
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
Four armed robbery

307
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,247
Now he's been shipped

308
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
Deanna

309
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
She's now in South Carolina

310
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,647
Yvonne you know she doesn't have much money she's never been able to

311
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
For the visit

312
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
So

313
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
One of the only ways she stays in touch

314
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,047
Sending pictures through the service

315
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,119
What does your son what does Johnny think of the photos that you send

316
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
Oh he loved them he loved them

317
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
Oh he loves them

318
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
Does he have a favorite picture

319
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
Yeah me standing at the store

320
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Cooking

321
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
He loved to see that one

322
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
Cooking

323
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
Oh I don't know I probably was

324
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,135
Let's make us some meatloaf collard greens and

325
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,487
Macaroni cheese something like that they on Sundays I cook a lot

326
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,655
And he always tell me on Thanksgiving I ain't there Mama but find somebody that that ain't got none need and get my plate

327
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Say I do it

328
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
I do it every year

329
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,311
Frederick sent out his first postcard

330
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
In 2012

331
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
And three years later Steve

332
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
Steve you went to visit him at in Las Vegas

333
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
Alright whenever you're ready go ahead

334
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:15,391
It's a little startup space it's really not much more than like a two-story Loft and it's just

335
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:21,791
Packed with people gives a half a dozen customer service reps at any given time they work in shifts

336
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,863
Answering phone call

337
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,703
Frederick has like your startup uniform you know t-shirts Jean

338
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
And he is busy

339
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
Cell phone on his ear

340
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
Hey Daniela

341
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,223
Hey hey we're on our way I'm glad you text me cuz I completely forgot to bring the check so I had to go back to get the check

342
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Ovia

00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,879
Yeah we're coming yeah we'll be there in probably about 5 minutes miles getting sick now

344
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
I think you

00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
That check it's for new office

346
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Bigger office

347
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
They said they need it because they're not just sending pictures anymore

348
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
Frederick's companies built this giant database

349
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
All federal prisoners in the country

350
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,311
And they're using it to sell all sorts of services

351
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
They started a telephone service

352
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:12,991
They gives families local numbers so they don't have to pay those sky-high prison long distance

353
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Indoor growing

354
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Faxed

355
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,879
They didn't ditch that old prison name picture Graham

356
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,463
The company has a little bit more 2015

357
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Pigeonly

358
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
Pigeonly mycarrier

359
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,679
I travel a lot so I like traveling and no matter where I go you when I was in Japan most recently

360
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
And I notice how pigeon so common that we never pay attention to him even though they're all around us all

361
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
All the time

362
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:44,223
And that's going to help you out a lot of times it says this Market that's all that's here in present but nobody

363
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
Kind of like prisoners

364
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
How do I get sconce

365
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
Or their families

366
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
Frederick has raised a lot of money

367
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,487
And investors love this story of this ex-con

368
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,791
Made good guy who went out

369
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,327
After going to jail

370
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
And built a business to serve people like him

371
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,983
You know what you think about it none of this would have been possible none of it would have happened

372
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
If you hadn't gone

373
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
The prison if you hadn't made this huge mistake

374
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Brokenness mother's heart

375
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
So I had to ask

376
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
You think going to prison was worth it

377
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,015
Do you think what you did was worth it

378
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
Yoda pic

379
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
I would say

380
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
The people that I

381
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Hurt

382
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
It wasn't

383
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Worth it

384
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
But

385
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,607
What I've been able to turn it into it's definitely worth it I don't know if

386
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,959
I would have grown up as fast as I've grown up Armature decisive matured without experience

387
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Without

388
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
Conditions that I lived in for

389
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
I don't know if that

390
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:47,967
Would have happened in the same speed out of my life will be on the same track it is on now had I not experienced out

391
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
But I was given opportunity I was given

392
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,343
An opportunity to turn something around and make an impact

393
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
And if I squander that

394
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,999
And you know I'm not only my let myself down my family who went through all that is like I didn't go through all that for anything

395
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
At that point so

396
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,119
Haven't taken through so much pain in her I have to make a successful at this point

397
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
Because service was all for nothing

398
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,007
Salt Lake Frederick can never forget what he did

399
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,567
It recently he went to rent a new apartment

400
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,919
Here in Las Vegas right there on the application form there was this box

401
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Are you a convicted

402
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
She had to answer yes

403
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Sol.

404
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
He's raised $3000000

405
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
Delta business

406
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
And the landlords

407
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Required the Frederick Hutson

408
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Dad

409
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Finally

410
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,287
Wish it was originally recorded in 2015 it is of course

411
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,847
17 now I'm Robert here in the presence

412
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,455
And we recently checked in with Frederick Hudson about his company to see how it's going for him

413
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,503
He says a lot has changed

414
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,063
He's now raised 6 million dollars

415
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,623
The service is expanding to State and County Prison

416
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,183
Are even approved a new Social Network

417
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Call

418
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Prison wives

419
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,047
The sort of support group for women with loved ones in prison

420
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
But there been growing pains 2

421
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,911
Frederick City realize that some of his employees were

422
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:11,935
Mediocre

423
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
And had let them go

424
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
And then there was

425
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
The computer at

426
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,615
It happened in like a 24-hour. Someone created

427
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
I want to have a million fragile accounts on all service and it was basically making a hundred thousand

428
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
A phone call

429
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,855
Expensive definition

430
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
That was big enough of an issue

431
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Tooker Avenue

432
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:38,815
Thankfully it did not these days Frederick says pigeonly send about 5,000 photos a day and each month

433
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
The process is about 2 million minutes

434
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Phone calls

435
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
He says they're on track to reach a profit

436
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
