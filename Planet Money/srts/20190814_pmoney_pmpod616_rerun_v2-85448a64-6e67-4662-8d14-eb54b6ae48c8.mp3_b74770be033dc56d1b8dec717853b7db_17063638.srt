Today Show originally ran in 2015

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:31,232
I will be back in 2019 at the end of the show with an update

10
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:37,120
All my life solar power has been the thing that's coming in the future

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,936
Why can science fiction how are we going to power The Ringworld

12
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,728
You didn't read it good luck

13
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,824
Solar panels in the real world though solar has been this fringy thing

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,872
Like I remember when I was in college

15
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,944
This friend of mine was on the solar car team

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,344
But they think they built wasn't really a car it was basically just like these giant solar panel and this little like capsule

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,136
Call that you had to lie down into drive

18
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,208
Have solar calculator for solar calculator

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
Those are real

20
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,816
You grew up in California there were a few Rich hippies up in the hills with solar panels

21
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,632
But it was like a special things or thing you'd see in a MAG

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
And that is actually

23
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,496
Changing really fast just in the past couple years

24
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,568
Power is not just for Rich hippies

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,408
Last week I went out to Long Island to meet a guy named John okay

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
John is a retired New York City Cop

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,576
And today I just across six guys with putting solar panels on the roof of his house

28
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
Tell me about your house

29
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,696
What do you want to know where do termites live

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
I don't know how big is your house

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,304
Guy 4 bedrooms two-and-a-half baths

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
So sorry

33
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:44,448
What's up with the neighbors like this is Farmingville nice neighborhood middle-class Working Families

34
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
Done is not rich

35
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
And he's not getting solar panels to save the world

36
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
The environmental part of it

37
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
Meaningful to use ml

38
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
Not really

39
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,040
If you are an environmentalist or if you just

40
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,576
Like solar power

41
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,392
John o'hagan is your dream come true

42
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,208
Jennifer Hagan is the revolution you've been weighed

43
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,024
He's not getting solar power for a

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,328
Moral or philosophical reasons

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,632
Not doing it cuz he's worried about climate

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
John o'hagan is getting solar power because it's cheap

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,848
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob Goldstein

48
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,688
And I'm David kestenbaum today on the show House solar power got so cheap

49
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
So fat

50
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
Basically

51
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,232

Most of you have a great business idea

53
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Like Maggie

54
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:46,400
You always love croissants and even traveled to France to learn how to make

55
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
She got a business name

56
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
Maggie's Bakery

57
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,288
And with the help of Google domains intuitive tools

58
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
She got her business online

59
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
And croissants in people's hands

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,968
Google domains makes it easy to get your business online

61
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
It starts with a name

62
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
It becomes real

63
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
With a domain

64
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,160
Make it happen add domains. Google / NPR to get started

65
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:15,840
Greg what are you doing here again I write a newsletter

66
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
Where can people get that sweet sweet content npr.org Planet Money newsletter that's what I can say

67
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
That's what they contain up yet

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
The story of how solar power got so cheap

69
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
He's not the story of one braid

70
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
There wasn't one engineer in some lab

71
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Who solved the solar problem

72
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Afternoon

73
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
It's a story of a few things

74
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
You can split it up into three

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,328
First category is the one you would expect that not for the reason you

76
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
The panels

77
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Pendleton cells have gotten

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,752
John the guy made out of you was getting 41 panels on his

79
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
I guess that's

80
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Pretty typical

81
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
When I got out to his house

82
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,944
There was a truck in the driveway and a bunch of the solar panels were just right there leaning up against the

83
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
So is this this is can I touch this

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
It's one of the panel

85
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,600
Restaurant where to get suicune on the roof I'm not going to

86
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:13,440
The company putting up the panels on John's house is called Solar City

87
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,280
It's actually the biggest residential solar installer in the country

88
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
We could she oversees the companies East Coast

89
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Installers

90
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
8 years ago how much would a panel like this a car

91
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
1000 hours

92
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Okay

93
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,335
This panel just handle right here how much does it cost now

94
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
I would estimate

95
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
Somewhere around

96
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
220 $50

97
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,807
Go from a thousand bucks to 200 or 250 bucks

98
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
In just a few years just a few years

99
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
That's a huge step

100
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,695
It's a big drop the reason for the big drop

101
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Is that

102
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
Someplace made a lot of solar power

103
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
You can actually see it.

104
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
It's written on the back of the panel

105
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Little letters

106
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
So what what does it say

107
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,751
This is Trina Solar Smart Energy together

108
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
Made in China

109
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,895
Ignore ignore most of that ignore trina solr ignore energy together sisolak

110
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Dragon China

111
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,527
It's not your typical story of China figuring out how to make something cheaper

112
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,831
This is the story really of China making

113
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
A mistake

114
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,671
Basically China decided when it was going to get into solar power

115
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
It was going to go big

116
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
The government

117
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
Set up all these subsidized loan

118
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
And Chinese companies built

119
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
All the solar power

120
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Factory

121
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Factory

122
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
After Factory

123
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,215
As a result when all these factories came on line around

124
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
2009

125
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,543
There was a huge glut of solar power

126
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
The price collapse

127
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,967
If you one of the companies in the US or Germany and Japan that's already in the Solar business

128
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
At what is not what you

129
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,087
When did the Glock if you don't know about cost

130
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
With.

131
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
This is Lyndon Rive

132
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
He's the CEO of SolarCity

133
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
This is Hugo from

134
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
Lowering your car

135
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
As a standard part of the

136
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
The companies

137
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
That

138
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Mission 2

139
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
If you don't love it

140
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,215
Given that alternative

141
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
Death of lawyer cost

142
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
People become very innovative

143
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,871
Different companies with different ways

144
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,431
Some companies did innovator lower their costs

145
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Others

146
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,551
Died there was this massive wave of bankruptcies in the industry and

147
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,159
Largely because of that played as a bad news story in this country and their well-being

148
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,767
Little mini trade war between the US and China over the solar subsidies

149
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
But you know the end of the story is

150
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,375
Panels did get a lot cheaper

151
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,215
Okay that's the first thing that is made solar power more affordable the panels themselves

152
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
But there is this other major expense

153
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,591
If you want to have solar panels on the roof of your house

154
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,431
You got to pay someone to put the solar panels on the roof of your house

155
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
You got to be a lot of people

156
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,759
John's house the crew with six guys

157
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
4 installers into electrician

158
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
Jacob have you ever had one electrician out

159
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
IHOP

160
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
I mean they're handling actress

161
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,583
Insulation solar panels can actually cost

162
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
As much as the panel

163
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Themselves it's a big part of the car

164
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,983
Again just in the past few years installation

165
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Has actually gotten

166
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
A lot cheaper

167
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
Cheaper is

168
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
It's gotten fast

169
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
You don't have to pay those guys to be out of your house for as long

170
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,503
When I was at a John's actually saw some of the reasons it has gotten fast

171
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575
This is the zepto this is the end-all-be-all tools

172
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,391
Does that to let Led Zep 2

173
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
Exactly 1/2 of the ruling

174
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
That's a guy named Brian Barney

175
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
What's the zip tool

176
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,375
It's a wrench is Bandit physically register these little marks on it or whatever but

177
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,703
The key thing is it's part of this whole Installation System

178
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,287
It's happening this is this is this is the meeting potatoes here

179
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,431
About an hour and a half after they get to John's house the crew is ready to start actually putting in the first row of

180
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
And once the first one goes in its just

181
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,343
It's just like jigsaw puzzle one piece will fit in the next one to the next one

182
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
And that first row is going to go up in

183
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
I don't know 2 minutes

184
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,767
Well let's see what time what time is it let's see how long it takes

185
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
59 to 9:59 2 minutes

186
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,191
Ticking clock retention even if it's just getting solar panel

187
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,311
It's at the guys up on the roof right right at this point there they're kind of rocking the panels in

188
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:17,407
Play feel I clean them and they lowered him down and when they're in their right to make this this

189
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Crack them

190
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,087
66 panels in that first row

191
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
Few more snaps and

192
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
It was done

193
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:35,583
That's it how we doing what time is it 1:55

194
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
To be clear

195
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,215
Little 2-minute race is just a tiny part of the whole installation

196
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,055
Right foot all of this stuff does Neptune rule the one told to rule them all is that

197
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
Whole new system all of it together meme

198
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,711
Insulation really is a lot faster and cheaper today than it was a few years ago

199
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
How long is it going to take

200
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,063
4 hours

201
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
4 hours

202
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:03,487
So how long would a plain-vanilla installation of Taken I don't know 5 years ago 10 years ago when you got into this installation

203
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
About 2 days

204
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
2 days

205
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
And now it's half a day

206
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Half a day

207
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
That's you

208
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Syracuse Craigslist

209
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Eliza

210
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
These guys are going to be done by lunch time

211
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,567
Okay we got cheaper panels cheaper installation

212
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
What's the cost down to

213
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,687
About $25,000 still alive

214
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
Yeah that's basically what Johnson

215
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,759
Pacific icon

216
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
She is back

217
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
Looked into a gift for the savings and every company

218
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
$1,000

219
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,999
You have $2,000 short time later on no solar panels on its roof till today

220
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
This was the final obstacle

221
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,655
Who has $25,000 sitting around by solar panels and get them

222
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
I mean some people

223
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
But not a lot.

224
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,543
Right it's always going to be a friendly thing if you got to have this money

225
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,615
I mean I get them you can make the money back over

226
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
Overtime but it's just hard to think about spending $25,000

227
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:00,063
And this right here this is where we get to the last big breakthrough that's made solar really take off

228
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,159
Donald Hagen is not paying $25,000 to get the panel put on

229
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Flask

230
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
He's not paying anything

231
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
0

232
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
He's not buying the pain

233
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
He doesn't own the power

234
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
The panels belong to Solar City

235
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
The way it works is John Cena con

236
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:17,215
Promising to pay SolarCity a monthly bill for the next 20 years

237
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,335
In the long run this will cost John more than if you just paid for the whole thing upfront out of his pocket

238
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
But it makes it work

239
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
And it makes the whole decision for John really sing

240
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Should I go solar

241
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
Comes out a really simple calculation

242
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
How much am I paying on my life

243
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
And how much can I get a pay if I switch to solar

244
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,927
It just seems like a great deal that's the electric bill

245
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
40 50%

246
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,279
So how much you paying there for your power bill

247
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
About 180 a month

248
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,423
And so you pay 180 a month how much you expecting to be paying on this

249
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,239
I should come down to about a hundred hundred and ten

250
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,311
A month wants to switch your agates weapon these guys

251
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
Hook me up to the electric box I'm all set

252
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
That's it

253
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
Just that simple calculation

254
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
That is

255
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
The heart of

256
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
America's roof

257
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Top solar boom

258
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,647
It's a guy who doesn't particularly care about the environment a guy who's

259
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
Not trying to make a statement

260
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
The guy who sang

261
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,023
If I get solar panels put on my roof today

262
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
My power bill is going to go down next

263
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
There is one problem with this whole

264
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,471
All set up if your SolarCity and you're going to be paying for solar panels

265
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
People's houses across America

266
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Back it's really expensive

267
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
Twenty five

268
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
You do the math

269
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
It's like Billy the dog

270
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,711
And SolarCity the young company they don't have billions of dollars

271
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
Here's how they solved that problem

272
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,807
SolarCity and other companies in the industry

273
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,623
They went to Wall Street they went to Big Banks instead

274
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,743
Do you want to own solar panels big investors big

275
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Big Wall Street Banks

276
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
Put up billions of dollars

277
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,959
And they essentially own little pieces of solar panels on you know house is like John's and they get this flow of the pain

278
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
Payments for the next 20 years

279
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
Solar panels

280
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
People's rooms across me

281
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Until they solve the problem

282
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,663
And that is how solar power got cheap

283
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
The solar panels themselves

284
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,063
The one tool to rule them all fancy fast installation

285
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
+ 3

286
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
Creative financing

287
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
I got so far is

288
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
Subsidies is the government

289
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
There's a big

290
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,375
Federal tax subsidy that is is a big deal in that may go down

291
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,007
In the relatively near future a lot of States also have subsidies I know John is getting a state level subsidy as well

292
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,591
Only a small fraction of the electricity in this country comes from Solar Ray

293
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
Kind releaf

294
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Is right

295
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
But it is growing

296
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
In fact you found this

297
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
Report by Greenpeace why do expect to be sore

298
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,343
Overly optimistic the report was called Energy Revolution

299
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
Animated Verde

300
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
They undressed

301
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
Where we would be today

302
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Yeah yeah it's

303
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,023
It basically nobody predicted it would grow as fast as

304
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
And today

305
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
John is even trying to get his dad

306
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,191
Is your dad going to do it next least thinking about it

307
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
The app

308
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
That's good what

309
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
It'll come on

310
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,103
Come on pop what you got to save a few bucks.

311
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,687
2015 you got to get with the program solar is in right

312
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,295
Jacob you know that is exactly the kind of pissed that works for me

313
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
Save a few bucks.

314
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,415
Dyson look into solar a while ago I got a little flyer in the mail and I called the

315
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Number

316
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
And the guys like what's your address

317
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
Can I tell him

318
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Tap tap tap

319
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
I'm putting in the Google Earth

320
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
Is that tree fill in your front yard

321
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,215
I think I see you going to cut it down

322
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
My day is not going to work

323
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
The nice tree

324
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
SMC

325
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,455
So they're actually a few reasons that solar doesn't work for it for a lot of pee

326
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,551
People in effect trees are big when trees are your roof doesn't face the right direction

327
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
Another big one is

328
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
You got a pretty good

329
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
Read it right they're not going to

330
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,207
Trust you to make this 20-year deal

331
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Unless you have

332
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
Good credit

333
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,583
A third one is it mostly just makes sense for Homeowner

334
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
Is it doesn't really make sense for renters

335
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
At this point

336
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,703
So how many houses do you think this might make sense for

337
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,823
There's a really wide range of estimates but from what I read in the people I talk to is it something like

338
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,175
10 to 20 million seems like a pretty safe bet 10 to 20 million houses

339
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,247
Which is about 10 or 20% of the houses in the country

340
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,551
That's not going to like solve

341
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Climate change

342
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
But that is serious that's not

343
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
Frenchie that is not nothing

344
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
That's real

345
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
What time is it

346
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
753

347
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Turn it on right now

348
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,447
So the power light green that's a good start what does that mean it's getting DC power from from the roof

349
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,799
So just to be clear the power that is turning on this light and this thing is coming from

350
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
Coming from the Sun

351
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,087
That the guys clean up the roof they put the ladders back into the truck and maybe they were done by lunch

352
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
Where they go

353
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
I think they went for wings

354
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:59,071
So that's where we left it in 2015

355
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
After the break

356
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:06,751
We'll have an update on what has changed in rooftop solar since then

357
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,199

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
What's a culinary deal-breaker for you

362
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,911
Ketchup on hotdogs makes me really uncomfortable

363
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,287
Listen to NPR's ask me another the answer to Life's funny or questions

364
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:48,223
There have been some changes in rooftop solar since the show first aired in 2000

365
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,599
When is the company that was doing the installation at John O'Higgins house Solar City

366
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
Got into financial trouble

367
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,695
They borrow too much money that grew too fast

368
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,023
They wound up selling themselves to Tesla in mm

369
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,351
16 they laid off thousands of workers and cut way back on

370
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
Sales and marketing

371
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
And that was a blow to the whole industry

372
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,263
So much so that the number of new rooftop solar installations

373
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
Bell in 2017

374
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
So it started climbing again

375
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Last year

376
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
Another update

377
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:22,527
That federal subsidy for solar that we mentioned that was renewed

378
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831
Currently set to phase out over the next few years

379
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
Also since we first did this show

380
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:32,255
The Trump Administration put tariffs on solar panels imported from China

381
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:37,631
But because the panels themselves are only a small part of the cost of getting rooftop solar

382
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,191
Those tears actually didn't have that big of an empath

383
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
One last thing

384
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,079
The price of panels in the other Hardware has continued to fall

385
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,431
So getting rooftop solar is now cheaper than it was in 2002

386
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:02,719
Thanks to Michelle Davis of wood Mackenzie she's the one who told me all the ways in which rooftop solar has changed since

387
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
2015

388
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,351
But the original show we also spoke with shayle Kann of GTM research

389
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
And David pomerantz of green pee

390
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,495

And I'm David kestenbaum Thanks For Less

399
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
You've never read Ringworld it's really

400
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,607
Solar panels orbiting the Sun and then they have this ring outside

401
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,679
Would very high wall so the oxygen stays in through sink

402
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Tropical Force

403
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
I think we're almost there

404
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
I feel like 2 years from ringing
