1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,328
In the fall of 2010 something

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,096
Expected happy

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,120
In Blue Hill Maine

4
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,936
A town where unexpected things rarely happen

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:12,288
It is a small town about 2600 people tucked in to the Maine coast

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
It's a beautiful

7
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:17,408
Madia isolated places he have to kind of go out of your way to get here

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:20,736
This is Jim Schatz who lives in Blue Hill gym is

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,296
Friendly soft-spoken the kind of guy who would

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,088
Your dishes after a party

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,416
In fact when we met he had just helped cook a town Mother's Day

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,768
Hopefully they were had a chance to have brunch didn't did you what did you get there in time

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,632
Sadly I had just eaten anyway in 2010 when a Maine state senate seat

14
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,936
Came open gym decided that he was going to go

15
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,008
For it I thought I had a really good chance I thought I would win

16
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,592
Jim's opponent was a republican named Brian Langley

17
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,384
Brian is also very friendly

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
But in more of a polo shirt neatly tucked in firm handshake

19
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
Sound like kind of

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,296
I say don't be an activist

21
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,624
Be just active in your community that is Brian

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,904
His campaign strategy

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,024
I'll give out 5000 blueberry pie recipes at the bar Harbor

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,376
Prayed he says his pie recipe is wanting more votes than his political views

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
But sit on the back of a

26
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,424
Best campaign Flyers

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
And Jim on the

28
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,824
Brightside revved up the marketing strategy that had won him eight elections before this

29
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
Is there a slogan for gym chat

30
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
Evoke

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456
Offer gym that's about it

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
Yeah it's I like it and since everyone there generally knows everyone campaigns are pretty low-key

33
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
More pie than politics

34
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,744
But in the fall of 2010

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Out of nowhere

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
These ads started showing up

37
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,424
They hit the streets Bam Bam Bam and on television it was his bam out there

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,728
So Jim showed me a few of these ads

39
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
The first one was just like this

40
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
8 by 10 flyer it has a

41
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
American flag on it

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Picture in the middle

43
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
And it says baseball apple pie Fourth of July in fireworks not this Fourth of July gym shots and had other priorities

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,088
Someone with accusing Jim of the

45
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
Canceling America

46
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
Poop that leave the fireworks

47
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
But it gets worse

48
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,256
The next fire he shows me is if

49
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
Picture of this

50
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:14,144
Really sad young girl maybe six years old mouth wide open screaming

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
And says

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
This child just found out Jim shots cancelled Fourth of July fireworks

53
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
I'm part of this is true blue hill had canceled its Fourth of July celebration and Jim did have a say

54
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,968
He's in Blue Hills Local cover

55
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
But

56
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,808
I did not vote to get rid of it

57
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
Jim was actually the only person who voted

58
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
Keep the faith

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
And so it

60
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,232
It's just was totally misleading

61
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,840
This was an election so when you see something like that you just point to the other side

62
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,192
In this case that would be Brian Langley the Republican with the blueberry pie

63
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:54,336
I didn't set these up I didn't I have no idea where they're coming from I was just sort of Blindsided

64
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,432
So she calls up a big rig in the Maine State Republican party and asked

65
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Do you know who did this

66
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,040
And did you some research and come back to Brian and say

67
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,856
It wasn't Us in fact we don't think it was anybody in May

68
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,136
And Brian is

69
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
Afraid that these ads are actually going to

70
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Hurt him because

71
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
In Blue Hill

72
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,768
This kind of negative campaigning

73
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
So

74
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,936
She turns around buys his own new set of ads just to say those negative ads

75
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
I have nothing

76
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,568
So now Brian's platform is basically I like the guy I'm running against

77
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
I like Jim

78
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
But

79
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
Salary for Jim it was

80
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
There is all over basically

81
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
And I are not so it was

82
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
Send

83
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,184
It was the first time since 1992 that are Republican won that District

84
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,000
When Tip O'Neill said all politics

85
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,424
Our local now it's not local it's coming from people who have nothing to do with the local

86
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
And in the aftermath

87
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,032
The town was left with a very big question

88
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
If Brian didn't do this

89
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
And the state Republican party didn't

90
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,432
Who inserted themselves in this

91
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Localist

92
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
If local election

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
I'm fly

94
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:11,648
Brian and Jim didn't know it that fall in Maine but they had gotten wrapped up in one of the most

95
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047
Brilliant political schemes of our time hello and welcome to Planet Money I Am Karen.

96
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
Noel King today on the show we meet the man who took the idea that all politics are local to the bank I'm making

97
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
A tiny investment in the smallest of places he set in motion one of the biggest political shift in Generations

98
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:37,247
One that would shape elections not just in Maine but all across the country for years to come including

99
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,391
The midterms this fall

100
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,463
Support for this podcast

. org

108
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,639
To get to the bottom of what happened in Maine in that follows 2

109
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:10,527
We have to turn the clock back into the 80s into the early 90s this is Chris Jankowski

110
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
He is a longtime Republican operative

111
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
I'm back in the 1990's he had just graduated from law school and started working in the South Carolina attorney general's office

112
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
At a really unique moment

113
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Four state pilot

114
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,399
I was there as a young Assistant Attorney General during a tobacco litigation

115
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
Tobacco litigation

116
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,007
It was 1998 and the tobacco industry paid out and his

117
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
Store Excel

118
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
They were finally forced to act

119
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,943
And it wasn't the federal government who did it it wasn't Congress it was

120
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
State politicians

121
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Uniting together

122
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,159
That was the first sort of collective effort of state attorney generals to make a national impact

123
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
For Chris

124
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:54,303
It changed the direction of his life and eventually it changed the direction of the entire country

125
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,351
Chris saw that states acting

126
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
Together can wield a ton of collective National

127
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,495
Which is just not how people were viewing State policy

128
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
That it really is sort of

129
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:09,151
Consider the junior varsity new job working for the insurance Lobby

130
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:15,551
And insurance is mostly regulated at the state level so Chris is learning all the wonky mechanics of State politics

131
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,855
And while he's toiling away at the

132
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
The state level on a

133
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
All this money being thrown

134
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
National efforts in DC

135
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
Doesn't see a lot of progress

136
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,655
And he starts thinking they would just give me 10% of what they were spending federally I swear

137
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,263
I could have an impact of this untapped potential of state power

138
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,615
A cruise from an epiphany into sort of a chip on Chris's shoulder

139
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:44,735
And eventually he leaves Insurance lobbying and along with a few State friendly collie

140
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
He decides to start his own group

141
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
And focus just on States

142
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,671
What caused the Republican state leadership committee Dr SLC

143
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,023
Sonata 2002 and these guys start working on individuals

144
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
State elections and

145
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
State issues

146
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
And all the while

147
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,167
They're looking for their tobacco moment

148
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
Something big

149
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Did all the states

150
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Together can get

151
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
And they've been doing this for a couple of years when

152
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
One Sunday in

153
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
2009 Chris

154
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Open finished

155
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
Paper of course

156
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,271
I have to admit I read New York Times but

157
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
I did and

158
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
Reading the New York Times

159
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
Shamefully

160
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,695
I said while I'm I'm reading a national

161
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,999
Congressional story

162
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
That really is about my world

163
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,655
The article talked about major demographic shifts that would likely show up in the

164
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
2010 census

165
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Reshape

166
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
The elections

167
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
Cuz mine just starts

168
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,591
Turning okay you might remember this from history class

169
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,175
Every 10 years the Constitution says we have to do a census

170
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
We have to count up all the people in the United

171
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,879
And then we have to divide everyone up equally ish into 435 Congressional

172
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:00,767
Every district has the same number of people and gets to elect one representative to the US House

173
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815
That is equal representation

174
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
And so every ten years after the census

175
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,215
Statesville often have to redraw their maps to adjust for population

176
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,799
Yeah like a bunch of people leave Kansas they moved to Missouri the match

177
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,615
Right so maybe Missouri gets another congressional seat

178
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Can'ts loses one

179
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
And both States would have to

180
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
Are there maps to account for that

181
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
Redrawing District

182
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Reshape

183
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Elections

184
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,159
Because when you draw the lines when you draw them at

185
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,743
Super basically choosing which voters are going to end up in a district

186
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,583
You draw them one way in the district will send a democratic Congress

187
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,655
And drawing a different way might send a Republican

188
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,007
And districts drawn carefully, nearly guarantee a party a win

189
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
Maybe even then

190
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,151
Next decade this is called gerrymandering and both parties do it every chance they

191
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
So crisp

192
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
Puts down his New York Times

193
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Probably has it

194
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
Deep in his trash can

195
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
And thanks

196
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Found my issue

197
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
This is a way for states to wield

198
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Massive power

199
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,303
Because remember Jim and Brian who are running for state senate in Maine people like them control this Pro

200
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
Process for the most part

201
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,911
State legislatures draw the national Maps

202
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,495
The redistricting is like the secret superpower of State politics

203
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,799
The local controls the national

204
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
So Chris can coxis

205
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
Flip State legislatures red

206
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
And they will turn the National Mall

207
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Long-term results

208
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Breitbart

209
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
He calls the plan

210
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
Red Mountain what does Red Lobster

211
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,927
Oh this is one always dumps me

212
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Question I've asked

213
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,047
It's the district Republican

214
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,839
It's a redistricting majority

215
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
Project

216
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
Redistricting majority project

217
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
He did get it right at

218
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Is the register

219
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Senate majority project

220
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
And Chris just knows that his plan will work

221
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
For it to work he needs

222
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Money

223
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
And he knows

224
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
From

225
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,295
Experience that selling a state-level plan for republic

226
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
Kendama Nation

227
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Might be tough

228
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
It feels like

229
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,975
You're trying to fundraise for like an off-off-broadway show and everybody else wants

230
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,767
Invest in Lake Hamilton

231
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Exactly

232
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
So he makes it really

233
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
Simple he goes right to the heart of the matter

234
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Money

235
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
He does some cost analysis

236
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
And it shows that

237
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
In many cases

238
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
A dollar goes

239
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,103
Much farther in terms of impacting

240
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
Congressional c-diff

241
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
You spend it on Stateline

242
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
I Only Could this plan work

243
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
It is a

244
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
Huge bargain

245
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
So Chris starts Dialing for Dollars

246
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
Sorry you're wasting a

247
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,719
A ton of money every year on Congressional races sometimes we win sometimes we lose

248
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,047
For 25 cents on the dollar I can take

249
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
25 Congressional

250
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
It's off the table for the next 10 years

251
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
And slowly if

252
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
The money starts coming

253
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,287
From Individual donors and then later from Corporation

254
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,383
Chris eventually ends up with more than 30 million dollars

255
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
I just shook my head I just

256
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,735
Can't believe it and 30 million dollars

257
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
That amount of money

258
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
Barely make a dent in most national elections

259
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Chris thinks that he can win

260
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
Hundreds of State

261
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
For that much

262
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
But

263
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,303
There's a reason that no one had ever read mapped or blue Maps

264
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Before

265
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
Which is

266
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,679
There are 7383 local

267
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
State Legislative

268
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,823
You got to figure out which of those seats you're going to Target and then you have to influence

269
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
Hundreds of campaigns

270
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
That turn on hyper local issues

271
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
It's like in Maine with the fire

272
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
But then Chris realizes

273
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
You know it's figuring out which seats to go after

274
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
For the most part

275
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Actually sort of just

276
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,231
We use data and objective research we didn't have to actually meet the candidates

277
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
To know what we could do

278
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
This math problem has

279
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
The two part of

280
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Part 1

281
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,727
Identify which states might gain or lose

282
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
The congressional seat after the next

283
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
Because of demographic

284
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
About

285
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
Those dates

286
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
If they lost or gained is

287
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
They would definitely have to

288
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
To draw a new map

289
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
So we prioritize those dates

290
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
And

291
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
We came up with rough budgets

292
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,183
For what it would take to take control or maintain control

293
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
So at this point they've narrowed it down to

294
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
18 /

295
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
And this leads to part 2

296
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
You calculate the cost

297
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
To turn each

298
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,167
State legislature red

299
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,703
Now that is not a simple couch

300
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Explain it

301
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,055
It's pretty painful

302
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,383
It has to do with how many voters do you need to reach in order to flip

303
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,991
So Chris runs the numbers and he figures out which states to Target

304
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
And how many

305
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
And he starts spending money

306
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
On things like maybe

307
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
Give the money to the state party so they

308
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Spend it on there though

309
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Local races

310
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,791
And this is way more money than you normally see in local election

311
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
Like that race in Maine that we talked

312
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,167
What about Chris spent four times as much money on that race

313
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
It's in 2010 then the candidates had

314
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
2 years before

315
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Now comes the

316
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Really hard

317
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
How to win over to

318
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
200 elections

319
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
That turn on hyper local

320
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,015
That really had never been done before at that level

321
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
And that's

322
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
That takes

323
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,183
Do you know any really good at figuring out what the hot-button local issues were

324
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
Lincoln Kentucky they paid to are these

325
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,791
Secretly recorded tapes

326
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,863
Of a state senator calling his constituents Redmond

327
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,727
French with my redneck constituency got here and you know like

328
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
For Kentucky

329
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,079
And in Pennsylvania they insinuated that a democratic incumbent

330
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,919
Had spent $600 on an unpopular Viper

331
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Do you remember the most

332
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:44,319
Kind of obscure local issue that you invested in

333
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
There is someone who sat on a Town Council

334
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,719
Who had voted to cancel the fireworks display

335
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,791
So Ohio gets $1000000 to Target

336
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
Michigan also $1000000 but to go after

337
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
20 seats

338
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
44 seats in New York

339
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
We spent about 1.4 million dollars

340
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
And the money kept

341
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
Flowing in all the way up until election day

342
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,383
And then all Chris could do was wait

343
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
Would his bet payoff

344
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Support for this podcast

345

In the following message

346
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
Should come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

347

Developing solution

348

More information is available at aecf. Org

351
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
Tell me about election night

352
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
We had a

353
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
A war room set up all the way

354
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Really hate that term

355
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
So

356
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
It's election night November 2nd

357
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
2010

358
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
And Chris and his team are sitting around the

359
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
The conference table in their offices

360
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
Laptops open

361
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,015
And they are tracking state election results basically by hand

362
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
Because at that point

363
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:52,927
You can't turn on CNN CNN figure out who's winning control the Iowa house

364
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
That we went we all had contacts on the ground

365
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
And we start tracking

366
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,119
Michigan-ohio York Texas

367
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,191
Maine that's Brothers everyone's a sign States

368
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
The track we had a

369
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
A spreadsheet

370
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,311
They huddled in that war room all night

371
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
I think around 5 a.m.

372
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
I walked across the street to my hotel

373
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,735
Tried to sleep for about 45 minutes shower came back

374
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,295
And the great thing about State Legislative races

375
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
It's like having two Christmases

376
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:26,975
Back-to-back because you have election night Pennsylvania houses Flint Michigan Healthy Ohio how Iowa houses Wisconsin

377
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,815
Texas houseboat

378
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,375
And then you have the next day cuz Alexa

379
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:38,239
Results just keep coming in for Wednesday November 3rd 2010

380
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,591
State capitals across the country will be more Republican

381
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,151
Any points is a Roaring Twenties one

382
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,711
I knew that Wednesday afternoon

383
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
That it was

384
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,807
It was historic even Beyond with red Maps goals were

385
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,367
And the entire country was buzzing about how the

386
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Republican today

387
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Taking back the house

388
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,255
Because of the Tea Party Revolution and backlash against Obamacare

389
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
And Chris is like

390
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
Yeah that is exciting

391
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,143
But what is more exciting is that the Republicans had

392
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,703
Also just gained nearly 700

393
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Legislative seat

394
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
They flipped

395
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,287
21 State houses from

396
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
Democrat to Republican

397
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,175
So they ended up with majorities in both State Legislative Chambers

398
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Which meant

399
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,063
That they would entirely on the redistricting process

400
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
What's the country

401
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
Chris had his eye on the lung

402
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,207
The 2010 election was the beginning

403
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Not the end

404
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
It's all about what happened after

405
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
What happened was redistrict

406
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,399
Over the next couple of years one by one

407
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
Republican state legislatures

408
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Did start to draw the map

409
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
So they work in their favor

410
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:49,919
They were helped by very sophisticated technology that lets you gerrymander down to the last alley way down to the last

411
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
And these new red Maps

412
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Did their job

413
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,623
2012 democratic house candidates got 1.1 million more votes overall

414
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
Republicans

415
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,463
Dominated the house with 833

416
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Majority

417
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,303
In Pennsylvania Republicans got about

418
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
Half the votes so you think they'd get about

419
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,191
The seats but no they got nearly three-quarters of the

420
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
And over the next

421
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
Two election Cycles

422
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:19,615
Steve's reliably swing States like Pennsylvania and Ohio and Michigan

423
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
Their Congressional

424
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Stopped swinging

425
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
The JV team was picking the varsity

426
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
So now in many states

427
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
It's more like politicians

428
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,391
Pick their voters than voters pick their representative

429
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Yeah I don't

430
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
I don't feel totally great about

431
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
Tyramine because like

432
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
It's it's brilliant

433
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,911
But it's not something that everybody is

434
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Comfortable with

435
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
This kind of locks

436
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
Down

437
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
The democracy

438
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
In a way that

439
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Doesn't

440
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,335
Feel like democracy

441
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,943
Well I don't feel bad I messed up

442
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
Quite often I do not feel bad I don't apologize

443
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,319
I mean there's so many variables in a given election

444
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,367
Troubling to me that P

445
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,207
Just wanted to say boom this is bad you've undermined democracy

446
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,999
Chris points to the 2018 midterm

447
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
He said book the Democrats have

448
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
A shot at retail

449
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
House this fall

450
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
These Maps

451
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,423
Really undermined democracy how could that be

452
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,519
He also points out anybody could have done that Democrats could have done it

453
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
I'm still not sure why they didn't

454
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,407
This is a mistake that the Democrats

455
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
Do not plan to repay

456
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
They now have their own big plans for 2020 not going to

457
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
Call it blue mapping but today

458
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
And look this

459
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,951
Is legal partisan gerrymandering is legal in every single state except two of them

460
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,559
Although this morning in case 1611

461
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
That could change

462
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Maybe

463
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,751
The Supreme Court did pick up two cases this year about partisan Jerry

464
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
Which is an issue they have mostly avoided

465
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
They've said you know how do we even

466
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Measure how much partes

467
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Friendship is too much

468
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
Because you know elections are in here

469
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Partisan

470
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,319
The Supreme Court is looking at this now because

471
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Beat

472
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Started to answer that question

473
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,439
They started to Gin up mathematical formulas

474
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
To measure partisan

475
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,815
And also because this is only likely going to get worse

476
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,399
Which may be why the lawyer's argument sort of sounded like a desperate

477
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
Cry for help

478
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,007
The only Institution

479
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
Dick and solve this problem

480
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,711
And the court is deciding right now actually if they will be the answer

481
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
Institution to solve it

482
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,295
Their opinions will be issued this month

483
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,903
And if the Supreme Court does step in and set a standard

484
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
It could turn the countries Maps

485
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
And

486
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
The elections website

487
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
If they don't

488
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:51,167
If you let this go if you say this is good we're not going to have a Judicial remedy for this problem

489
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,775
In 2020 you're going to have a festival of CopyCat gerrymandering the likes of which the

490
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,335
This country is never seen so in 2020

491
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,151
We could be looking at Varsity Jerry man

492
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,479
Except this time both teams are suited up

493
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
