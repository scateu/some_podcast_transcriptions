Since the very early days of Planet Money we have regularly gotten emails from people asking us

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,320
Please please do a show about this

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,392
The thing I had to buy that seems weirdly

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
Xbox

11
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,976
He got the textbook there

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,512
Ideal yeah let me grab it

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
That wasn't cheap.

Fisher

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,912
This is Kendall Raiden to go to school at American River College in Calif

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,960
What's it called with the title

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
Where is college physics

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
And how much was the text

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,104
How much it was

20
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,920
Salt $310

21
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,736
It was the most expensive book she'd ever seen

22
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,272
Really she thought

23
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,320
$310 for a book

24
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
But some online stuff

25
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,160
So I was actually kind of irritated

26
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
You know

27
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,560
So I ended up at some point though I just needed the book you know we were starting class

28
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
Homework and

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
What's after I just went and

30
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
But put on a credit card

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,056
Kendall is not questioning the value of an education or that in long-run should be earning more as a result of

32
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Class

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
And the price that book will be a drop-in

34
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,688
It just seemed like a lot of money for what it was

35
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,528
And something truly strange has been going on in the text

36
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,856
There's this chart to get cited a lot maybe you've even seen

37
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
It's from a government report on text

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Book prices

39
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,024
And shows the price of new textbooks over the past decade and is a very steep

40
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,096
The prices of new textbooks have been going up like crazy

41
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
Faster than clothing

42
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Food

43
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168

Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm David kestenbaum and I'm Jacob Goldstein today on the

46
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,736
By popular demand why are textbooks so expensive

47
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
We talked to the students

48
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,344
And textbook authors and analysts and Publishers and

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
After all that we think

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,256
We found a pretty satisfying answer

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448
Let's start with a guy named James Cook

62
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,032
He taught economics at Old Dominion University for a long time

63
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,336
I never thought about the economics of tech

64
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
Xbox until at some point

65
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
Student started coming to him and asking

66
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
Excuse me professor

67
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Do we really need this book you a sign for class

68
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
It's kind of expense

69
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Cook's at death you need it

70
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
It's a good book

71
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,952
But this got him thinking about the odd nature of the text

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
One thing in particular

73
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
Which is that

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
He was the one who is choosing the book

75
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,400
He thought about it carefully the book was well-written

76
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,936
You know it was clear and it had

77
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,728
Good problems at the end of the chapters

78
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,568
Do you realize there was one key thing he did not know about it

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,872
I did not know how much it cost

80
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
Normally cook says

81
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,992
The person deciding to buy something is also the person paying

82
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
For that thing

83
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
In this case

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
That relationship was severed

85
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
The person choosing was not paying

86
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
Economist call this the principle agent problem

87
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
The principal is the person with the money

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
The agent is the guy figuring out how to spend

89
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
I call it the

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
Someone else's money Bravo

91
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
If someone spending someone else's

92
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,752
Is it really true Professor don't think about price when they're looking at textbook

93
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,104
I've been in higher education now for

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
What about for decades

95
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
And

96
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,576
I never have had a single textbook salesperson come into my office and talk about price

97
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
They're always talking about

98
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,184
G we have this new carburetor this new topics

99
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,512
We have this new DVD we have these

100
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,583
Ways that you can test students and

101
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,727
Give them quizzes and keep track of their progress It's always what's in the textbook package

102
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
Never about the price

103
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
God for a salesperson

104
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Not a taco

105
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
Price

106
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,943
Well it's not odd when you think that they're talkin

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
To a person who doesn't have to pay it

108
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
That's the problem huh

109
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,999
This can lead to higher prices really into different ways I mean first the simple one is

110
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
Publishers just have less of an incentive to

111
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,095
Keep prices down to compete on price

112
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,167
But the second one is actually more interesting to me

113
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
This Market

114
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,775
Can lead to a fancier textbooks and you get otherwise a textbook

115
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
Loaded up with stuff that students might not need

116
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
Cuz remember it's the professor who's the customer

117
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
Two Publishers of go to professors and say hey

118
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
By your textbook it comes with online quizzes and slides and a workbook I remember when I was in college like at the

119
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:18,463
The back of the biology textbook they was this DVD sitting that I never once used

120
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,511
But I paid for it in the price of the book

121
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
Ask about this

122
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Particular economic Tech

123
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
I happen to have

124
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
It is the best-selling economics

125
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
Textbook in America by Harvard Economist Greg

126
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,311
You can buy it on Amazon for $286 in

127
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Tarasco

128
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
Does what you're saying

129
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:41,503
Mean that Greg McHugh your fellow Economist is making more money than he should

130
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
It was an awkward question but I had to ask

131
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,671
Cook did not went away in so we did something more aqua

132
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
We called up Greg mankiw himself

133
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,839
This is a Greg mankiw I'm a professor of Economics at Harvard University

134
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,423
Let me just start by saying thank you for agreeing to come in and be grilled about the price of your texts

135
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
It's my pleasure I think

136
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,079
I want to know what did the author of an economics

137
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,383
Think about the very Market that that

138
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Textbook Within

139
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,967
The principal-agent problem is right there in his book

140
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Sun page 406

141
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
52

142
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,111
So I ran the idea by him that professors who picked the books aren't paying attention to

143
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
He agreed this was not ideal

144
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
But he didn't see it as a big problem

145
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
I don't think it's unusual

146
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,119
A market is you suggest any less of other markets that are similar when you

147
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,703
Go get a medical operation you often rely on the advice of a doctor

148
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,567
You know your paint you are the insurance companies paying the price when you go get your car fixed you're lying in the

149
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,871
Mechanics pick out the parts

150
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:45,247
App for you and your building a new house or a new extension on your house you're relying on your contractor to

151
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
Find the right parts in

152
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Look out for your best interest

153
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,671
So I think it's a lot of situations where we we rely on someone else

154
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,255
Help us make an informed decision is certainly the textbook Market

155
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
It is that way

156
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,863
I feel like the examples you chose Healthcare

157
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,447
Paying a contractor to work on your house going to a mechanic

158
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,287
Are all the things that people hate paying for for this reason I mean

159
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:13,919
People who get their homes renovated talk about what a nightmare it is and Healthcare is this famously broken Market

160
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,759
What is it whenever you have a principal-agent problem there is a risk of the agent

161
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
In this case is the professor doesn't

162
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
Doesn't do due diligence

163
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,903
Aspen do it doesn't do their job correctly and

164
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Look out for the best

165
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,743
Interests of the principal in this case has this business student

166
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
The good professor what would do that

167
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,399
Thank you says Professor do think a lot about what's best for the students

168
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
The biggest expenditure for students

169
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,263
It's not expenditure money but expenditure of their time

170
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,871
A lot of time in a course they should fit a lot of time in the course if they're going to get a lot out of it

171
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,663
And I want their time

172
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,223
To use it productively that can be

173
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
And giving them the best book

174
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
To read

175
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
That I can

176
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:57,439
Is baseball more important than saving them a few dollars so if somebody comes in and I have a book

177
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,791
Definitely not as good but they say your students $33

178
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
I'm going to keep giving it they're going to spend

179
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,935
40 50 60 70 hours of reading spoke of the course of a semester

180
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,055
Am I really going to skimp on a textbook to get something at inferior I don't think so

181
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,639
Okay we have this theory about the someone else's money prop

182
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
I'm driving up

183
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
The cost of college

184
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
It makes sense

185
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
But it seems hard to

186
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Right

187
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
You need some parallel universe with a

188
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
The people choosing the textbooks were paying

189
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
So you can see what difference

190
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
Fortunately for us that parallel universes exist

191
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
It's called

192
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
High School

193
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Very nice

194
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
High School textbooks are chosen and paid

195
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
For by the local

196
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
It turns out that forces Publishers to keep the cost down

197
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,055
Jonathan helliwell is a financial analyst

198
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,871
Panmure Gordon one of the oldest brokerages in England

199
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
He says Publishers are much

200
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Smaller profit

201
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
On high school textbooks than they do

202
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Oncologist

203
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
School book publishers

204
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
Megabox

205
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:02,975
Talk to 10% profit margins and college textbook Publishers make 22nd like 20 25%

206
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Profit margin

207
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
And you think one reason is that

208
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
The people picking the books aren't thinking about cost

209
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,191
The biggest reason is who's the customer and

210
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
And what's be

211
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Thanks for the boiling process

212
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:21,151
Has anyone in the publishing business ever acknowledged you that they have this advantage of the professors on thinking about coffee

213
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,927
They they haven't argued about it when I put it to the minister that way

214
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,743
The someone else's money theory is power

215
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
But it leaves out this one big thing that just about everybody we talked to agreed was a major factor driving

216
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,263
And it's something that it does not seem like it would make prices go up

217
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
It is the used textbook

218
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,687
20 years ago that used book Market was local basically you'd go to your College bookstore

219
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
How to use copy

220
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Buy it if not yours

221
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
The internet of course changed all that

222
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:05,183
Now in a student in Florida finishes her class she can sell her book on eBay to someone in Montana

223
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
Or just get a book on Amazon

224
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
Here looking at the page from mankiw textbook

225
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,863
New version $286 used

226
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
$227

227
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
If you don't mind one that's 2 years old

228
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751
Then get the previous Edition used for

229
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
26th

230
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,615
This means that if your publisher or text book author

231
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,199
You have this really short window to make money off your book because

232
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
After the first semester

233
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,319
All the students who bought your book are going to turn around and sell it to the next batch

234
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,415
Robert Frank is an economist at Cornell has written a textbook with

235
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
Former fed chairman Ben Bernanke

236
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Used to be

237
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,143
Your new addition would come out then the next year it would sell half as many copies as the first year and then half again

238
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,471
On the third year and now it's you sell copies

239
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,823
If you selling it all in the first year and it's it's done

240
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Almost nothing the next year

241
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,943
Tell if your Textbook Company faced with this problem what do you do

242
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
You're selling fewer books

243
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
How are you going to cover your costs

244
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
Well you raised

245
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
And this it seems is what

246
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Textbook companies did

247
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,951
But raising prices just made things worse

248
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
People came up with new ways to avoid those higher

249
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Textbook rental

250
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Illegal download

251
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Substance

252
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Skip buying books all together

253
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
Which meant the textbook companies were selling even fewer books

254
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
So they raised the price for new books again

255
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,847
You can see where this is going one textbook sales and I talked to call today

256
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
A spiral of

257
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
Destruction

258
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
So you have this battle

259
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,247
On the one hand the price of new textbooks going up and up and up

260
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
On the other hand

261
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,855
Student finding lots of ways around buying new full price books

262
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Who's winning

263
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
Print out there's data on this

264
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,231
Comes from the National Association of college stores

265
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
Did UT student surveys asking

266
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,351
How much do you actually spend on

267
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
We talked to Richmond they went through the numbers

268
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
In 2007 how much did students spend

269
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
$702

270
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,823
2090 years later

271
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,639
I reported spending $667

272
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
It went down

273
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Yes it did

274
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
2011

275
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,039
$655

276
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Down again

277
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,623
Went up a bit the next year then down even further

278
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,023
So what we seen essentially is flat to declining spending from students with the students were saying their spending

279
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
Required course material

280
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Over the last 5-6 years

281
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,679
Students have basically fought the Publishers to a draw

282
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,495
And yet everyone seems to feel like they're

283
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
Students will have to pay $300 for new fee

284
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
Physics textbook

285
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
Professors who hearing their students complain

286
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Textbook sales

287
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,991
People who once felt proud that they were helping further education

288
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,551
Banal embarrassed to be out selling these really

289
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,647
Which may be one reason why when I finally sat down with

290
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
David Levy

291
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
The president in

292
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
CEO

293
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
I'm one of the biggest textbook companies

294
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
Surround McGraw-Hill Edge

295
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Education

296
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
He did not want to talk about text

297
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
I kept asking about books

298
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
He kept talking about educational soft

299
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
Peace out of the way out of this big spiral of Destruction and

300
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
And Rising price

301
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
Electronic

WakeUpNow 500 Engineers building those full-time about a hundred and fifty million dollars a year

304
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,039
Going to product creation

305
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
Your grandfather's Textbook Company

306
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
Didn't do that

307
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,975
It's a past ride a business which was simple produce books and that's what it did

308
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,119
We are plowing shoes resources into creating a new set of instructional materials

309
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
Which help students

310
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,007
And help instructors and do so at a much lower price than ever been seen before

311
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
Really don't talk about books anymore

312
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,151
We we doing this isn't this is not is not very interesting to us

313
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,479
Digital textbooks are cheaper than traditional textbooks

314
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
Easy to update they don't weigh anything

315
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,087
But for students there is this one big drawback

316
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
You kept telling back to the bookstore or to anyone

317
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
At the end of the semester

318
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
There is no used market for digital textbook

319
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
I just got to find a way to keep students from downloading them

320
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
Car show today was produced by Phil Benton you can email

Purchase Beverly Minton Jamie pipe Phillips Josh Raymond and Brittany boscell several be by the way at the

324
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,215
Look into why there seem to be this constant stream of new editions of textbooks are those really necessary you ask

325
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
What time is it in California

326
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Copy

327
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
Do we ask this question

328
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
Robert Frank The Economist told us that for the microeconomics textbook that he right he did not see any good read

329
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
Why it needed to be updated as often as it is

330
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
He said for macroeconomics

331
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,647
You would want to update it because you know there are things like the financial crisis that have

332
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:56,511
I also asked David 11 the CEO of McGraw-Hill education about New Edition

333
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,143
Particular we were talking about calculus textbooks because you know subjective calculus doesn't really change

334
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:09,055
He told me they published one calculus book it had last been updated in 2011 five years after the previous Edition

335
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,895
He said they added a bunch of new problems and revived some parts of the text

336
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:18,271
But he wrote quote I can pretty much guarantee that we will never produce another print edition of this book

337
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
All right I think that's it

338
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
And I'm Jacob.

339
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
Thanks for listening
