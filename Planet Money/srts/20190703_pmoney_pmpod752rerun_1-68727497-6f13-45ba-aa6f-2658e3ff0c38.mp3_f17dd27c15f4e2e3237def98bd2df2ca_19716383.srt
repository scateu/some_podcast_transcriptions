Graphic descriptions of data

00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,640
White Oak pastures in Bluffton Georgia

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,432
About 2500 Acres

8
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,528
Will Harris runs the farm which has been in his family for more than a hundred.

9
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
Will was

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,904
Raised by his father and trained in school to be a modern Industrial

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672
Cattle farm

12
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,976
When I got out of college

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
I was excited

14
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,864
About a new pharmaceutical product like

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
For hormone implants

16
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
Why

17
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,960
Increase production

18
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,752
You you are able to do

19
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,568
More and more cheaper and cheaper

20
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,408
Will take over from his father made a profit every year

21
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,968
But at some point the way you looked at the world started

22
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:58,624
I wish I had a better story to tell you I wish it was the burning bush something but anyone like that

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
It was way more gradual

24
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,208
And it happened in all these different

25
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,024
For one thing he started to look at the soil

26
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
I noticed that

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
The soil

28
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
Just over that fence

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,192
Wade

30
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,496
Soil right here

31
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,056
He saw that the soil on the other side of the fence

32
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,128
So that had just been left alone was teaming with life

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
The Swale right here on his farm was dead

34
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,992
She thought was it was in the world

35
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,528
Image of defence lawyer

36
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
A wire fence

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,904
And then there was the day he was sending off about a hundred cattle onto a double decker truck

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
Have to go to a feedlot thousands of miles away

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,072
He realized maybe on the truck for days the ones on the top would be going to the bathroom on the ones on the

40
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
And

41
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,704
If he's around those that we have had on this Farm

42
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
Nurture them

43
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
To care

44
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,568
It just didn't seem right

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,664
And eventually he decided to change everything about the wave

46
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
You bringing chicken

47
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
The fertilized

48
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Grass

49
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
The grass would nurture the cattle

50
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,136
Shoppers at Whole Foods with line up around the block to buy his me

51
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
It was also

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
Perfect it was such a beautiful vision of the

53
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,328
Enlighten 21st century American Farm

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,192
It wasn't that so perfect that a literal symbol of America showed up at his farm

55
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
The bald eagle

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
But the bald eagle

57
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
America's bird

58
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104

00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,256
Farmers have been trying to put nature in a cage for thousands of years

63
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,328
What happens when you start to let nature out of that

White Stetson hat

00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:35,808
He drives around all day in his cheap basically running his farm and a few weeks ago I tagged along with him

77
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
This house was built in 1870 something by my great grandpa 1 download with my grandfather built

78
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:47,072
Early nineteen hundreds

79
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,960
My day was bigger than me and meaner than me and talk more like Foghorn Leghorn than I do

80
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,800
Seems impossible

81
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
Alfred Molina morphicon

82
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,968
By the way will Harris knows we are maybe making fun of his accent

83
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
And he's fine with that

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
In fact he's also making fun of RX

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,392
He told me the story about when he first started selling his meat at Whole Foods

86
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,232
He would visit the stores to be that sustainable farmer standing at a table

87
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
Handing out samples of his meat

88
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,351
A guy like you or lady

89
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
Won't mind take a little sapling

90
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,495
They snatch other cell phone iPhone go

91
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
Honey

92
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
Mission

93
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
I'm Whole Foods and

94
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,175
This is guy here and he's serving this beef and

95
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,575
I know we said we were going to have salmon for dinner but what do you think get beef will you think

96
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,439
Can you imagine what my wife would think if I called

97
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
If she was shopping to call me

98
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
We should

99
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
Mission Food

100
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,215
To driving down this this four-lane highway that runs through the middle of whilst

101
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
At at some point we pull off

102
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:02,079
And go down this dirt road into this really green pass

103
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
You could see there was like a

104
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,711
Forest off in the distance really beautiful and Will turns off the air

105
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527
Engine to tell me you know how we went from being

106
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:15,647
An industrial farmer to selling you know pasture-raised organic high-end meat at home

107
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
One of the first things he did

108
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
Was quit using pasta

109
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,815
But when he did that these new kinds of grass has started growing in this field

110
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
The cows would need

111
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
So we brought in sheep and goats

112
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
He also quit using chemical fertilizer

113
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
I'm running chickens instead

114
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
Can we buy

115
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Feed for the chickens

116
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
And

117
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,407
If he turns into poultry that we sell

118
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,759
By product to use the menudo that goes under the pastor that makes the grass

119
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Genius

120
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,903
The chickens are spread out all over the farm you know that wasn't here that was in there

121
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
And their manure is his fertilizer

122
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,303
And then he realizes if he's going to sell this high-end meet at a premium

123
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,911
Send his animals off to the industrial slaughterhouse with all the commodity cows

124
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
So he decides to build his own sled

125
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
Which is Barry

126
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
But he's still started growing

127
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:12,735
He got his meat into a bunch of Whole Food stores and Publix this chain of grocery stores in the South also started selling is made

128
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
He was paying off that debt

129
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,807
And then

130
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,111
About a year after he brought in the chickens

131
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
The first pair of Eagle showed up

132
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,047
So I was very excited by the thought of great I love natural systems and I love

133
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,095
Nature nopales fantastic

134
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
We'll quickly saw that

135
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
The Eagles

136
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,239
Who Loved is pasture-raised organic chicken

137
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
But it was okay with it

138
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,407
Was just a few Eagles and he told himself the Eagles are like Nature's version of quality

139
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
Play Don't Kill

140
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
The quickest

141
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991

Tropical people

144
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,623
You never get a sick bird from White Oak pastures

145
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
Everyone you get this

146
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,743
Your sister can say all but not random

147
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
The thing will didn't realize

148
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,143
Is that when Eagles discover an all-you-can-eat

149
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
Chicken buffet

150
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
The word spreads fast

151
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,543
First year they was at two or three the next year that was

152
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,383
Maybe till 12

153
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
Next year maybe 30 or 40

154
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Last year

155
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
They said it was 77

156
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
You have more this year

157
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
Yeah by Usher

158
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
As more and more Eagles started showing up

159
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
More and more chicken started.

160
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
Have a long time

161
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,815
Her for my employees would say they are eating is up back there

162
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,887
Alright I need it bad

163
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
And I wanted to be all right

164
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,543
But at some point I had to show you know they really are

165
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
Causing economic

166
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,735
Lost Eminem lose money on Broiler chickens would you make money on chickens if not for

167
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
The Eagles

168
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,575
Over the past few years will says

169
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
The Eagles have killed

170
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,671
Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of his

171
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
The peak season is winter

172
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
Right now

173
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,583
And will says the Eagles are currently killing a hundred or more of his chicken

174
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
Everyday

175
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655
Thousands of chickens a month

176
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
And this is easy to see

177
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,263
You just drive out into one of the fields where the chicken

178
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,823
So what am I what is Sarah I don't know

179

And there's some of them

Some around in the grass some of them are kind of chilling out under this thunder tree over there

183
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:34,047
You on the shoulder the chicken house or something or eating the feed

184
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
Drinking the water

185
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,423
You like these chickens are living the dream but for one thing man

186
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Bald

187
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
Eagles are just

188
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,567
Didn't they're in the trees right at the edge of the field

189
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
They don't make that

190
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,175
Screeching sound like you hear in the movies they don't really make any sound at all

191
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,247
But they do look big and beautiful you know they look like

192
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
A postage Stamper

193
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
Something you see airbrushed on the side of a van

194
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:02,207
But right there in front of us in this chicken Paradise were standing in our chickens the Eagles

195
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,535
Have killed so this got so this were looking at here is basically

196
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
The back half of

197
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
The chicken right there

198
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
Feet and legs

199
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,727
But the top half is essentially the eagle

200
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,799
Easiest way into the body cavity

201
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Have you seen that

202
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:23,711
That happening with your seen thousands of time legal to sticking his head in that body cavity

203
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,319
Episode 2 of why didn't the eagles this is pink because it gets all that blood on it

204
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,159
So there's that this guy with somebody basically ate right this is a

205
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
Eating up chicken

206
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,023
Dividend there's this other chicken 3 feet away it's also dead

207
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,351
This chicken was just just killed

208
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Cross respond

209
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
Nothing is happened to it

210
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
How many

211
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
Eagle Strike

212
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Brightness

213
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
Just like a sport just like

214
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,383
Screw you I'm going to kill one more ticket

215
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
There were most pissed him off

216
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:00,063
Will Harris has completely transformed his farm to live in harmony with nature

217
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,111
And now here is nature

218
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,695
Sticking its head into his body cavity and eaten his financial

219
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
WhatsApp

220
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
It's kind of in space all the time

221
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
Betting legal

222
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
Mega missile juvenile bald eagle

223
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Looks like

224
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Full and happy

225
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
Breath smells like chicken

226
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,847
How do you feel seeing all these Eagles just coming and eating your chicken

227
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Oh

228
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,687
Universal mixed bag

229
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,783
You know I could have it shotgun right now he's pointing at the back seat of the Jeep

230
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
He shot at other predators that were attacking his

231
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Does life suck

232
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
But Hair Says

233
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
Hey he doesn't want to shoot bald

234
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
Abby even if he did want to

235
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,703
Eagles have their own special law to protect them

236
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
The bald and golden eagle protection act

237
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
Which makes it a crime to quote

238
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,639
Pursue shoot shoot at poison wound

239
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,967
Kill capture trap collect molest or disturb

240
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Eagles

241
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,295
So will Harris is in a bind

242
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,623
Westfall he did get some good news from the Federal

243
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,671
Keeping granted special

244
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Not the children

245
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Baidu harassed

246
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
Basically try and make them go away

247
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
So he's trying all of these different things

248
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
What are the first things he did

249
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
You got one of those

250
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,495
Giant inflatable people like you see outside the car wash

251
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,799
You don't like this some kind of fan inside of Minnesota

252
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
Bend over and snap back up

253
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
He bought one of those

254
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
And put it up next to some chicken

255
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
He says it'll take about 15 minutes

256
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,527
To figure out there was just like one of those floppy guys

257
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,599
What would you like it

258
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
I actually saw this quickly

259
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,487
It was just lying on the ground the generator that powers and was out of gas

260
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,559
What about 15 or 20 feet away from a bunch of chickens

261
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
And yes one of the chicken

262
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
Will also put sparkly Flags out

263
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,703
Eagles didn't see

264
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Seem to notice

265
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:59,103
You got this big old noise cannon with a barrel like 3 ft long you could hear it miles away

266
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
Eagles didn't seem to care

267
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Another thing you tried

268
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
Admit

269
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Over the top

270
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,063
Like a canopy over the open area where the chickens are walking around

271
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,135
But apparently Eagles do not have to attack from the sky

272
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,231
We were just walked in the land is woke up under the net and get the chicken

273
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
Will is trying one other thing to make the

274
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
The Eagles go away

275
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
Maybe the most badass

276
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Of all the things he

277
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,215
He sent me out with his poultry manager Jeff Lackey to see you tonight

278
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,591
There you go right there is he going to go see just circle around to kill a chicken

279
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
Definitely I left his lunch

280
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Oh he just move down

281
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,527
We drive across this field get out by chicken house

282
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
There's a couple thousand chickens walking

283
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
And just spotted eagle

284
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,463
Actually looks like there's one the Pharcyde that tree there

285
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,303
He pulls out what looks like a little little pistol

286
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,399
Cap gun of sorts that takes these two caps in the back

287
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,007
Benny opens up this yellow box and pulls out his ammunition

288
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Take two

289
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,103
Black and goes into the gun so those look like little

290
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Firecracker

291
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,943
Chris basically asking a small mats almost

292
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
What to say

293
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Bird banger

294
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Warning

295
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Danger

296
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
15 mm

297
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,439
Captain has two barrels people it's one Banger in each Barrel

298
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Holster trigger

299
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
This firecracker shoots out like

300
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
25 feet and explodes in midair

301
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
Then he pulled the trigger again

302
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
And there they go

303
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,847
Did you see on the backside I treat are there goes one right now

304
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Eagles flying away

305
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
We can move them with the Birdman

306
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,735
And then they just come back

307
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:45,599
For the yellow go to another spot for now where we've got more birds and

308
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,159
Just circle around the many many pasture

309
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
That I can eat these chicken

310
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
I think it's going to go eat some other check

311
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
Yeah for the next couple hours

312
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Then they're going to eat this chicken

313
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Configure TV chicken

314
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,751
Will Harris says that you know maybe he's losing fewer chickens this year cuz of the bird bangers

315
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
Really to send it

316
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,127
But in any case he is still losing a lot he still losing money on his chicken

317
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,223
There is one other way will might be able to keep his chicken business

318
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,087
It's a federal program that pays Farmers whose animals are killed by protected animal

319
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
Boy killed by say bald eagle

320
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
How much do you think they should give you

321
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,791
The maximum is $125,000 per year

322
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,375
Everybody told me that for 15 and 16

323
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,703
Has the government giving you any money for the eagles killing a chick

324
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
Now $1

325
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
No one.

326
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,823
He's in this legal fight with a gun

327
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
This back and forth

328
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,639
What's the right way to count the losses what can

329
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Can a proof do you need

330
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,527
Are we did reach out to the government on this they said the case is under review by the local office

331
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,319
And they are not allowed to discuss the

332
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Whatever happens with the governor

333
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
It's clear that the Eagles are not going away

334
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,975
Are there like this living

335
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Killing

336
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Version

337
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Of a much bigger

338
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,887
We want a world where we can restore some kind of balance with me

339
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
But every time we try to do that we realized

340
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
How impossible it is

341
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,567
Your right here on the farm you just keep seeing this Gap

342
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,639
Between how the world is and how we want it to be

343
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
But will is resourceful

344
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,735
Yorkie keeps trying to cross that Gap

345
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
At one point as we're driving around the farm

346
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
We're next to this field with some chicken tonight

347
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
And there's a pickup truck coming the other way

348
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Wheel stops

349
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
The Jeep to talk to the driver

350
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,095
Hey how yo

351
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,215
I feel like you would I'm glad you did

352
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
In the bed of a truck

353
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,847
There's a guy with a camera with this giant telephoto lens

354
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
Which is apparently pretty common

355
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
People now come to Wells Farm to see the Eagles

356
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:53,855
Get the special Eagle day a few days before I was there even built cabins for people to rent out

357
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,927
Will Harris is getting into the eagle tourism

358
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Yep

359
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
NPR

360
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:13,055
9 years old

361
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,127
I'm glad

362
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,783
So that was where we left it with will back in 2017

363
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
After the break

364
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
I find out how will is doing that

365

Scraps of Life kit all guys Oliver episodes all in one place

374
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
A few months

375
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
After we originally ran this app

376
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,823
Someone who heard the story got in touch with Will

377
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,407
And he suggested something that he did seem work with other birds

378
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
That was

379
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,295
String a strand fishing wire up over the chickens in the pasture to

380
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Scare the Eagles away

381
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,647
We mentioned it a follow-up story that Will was trying it out

382
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
So last week

383
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
I called you and left to find out how it was

384
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
We built these

385
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
Really tall portable

386
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,143
Pole structures

387
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
Stretch this relay

388
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Big

389
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,775
Fishing lines of the Glen

390
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Reflect the light

391
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:55,455
I think I heard those Eagles laughing while you're putting it up

392
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
In the end the fishing wire didn't work

393
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
He told me they're trying this new thing

394
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,927
Big fences basically so the chickens can still walk around in the pasture but with bound

395
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,767
I'm actually a little bit seagulls don't seem to like

396
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
2

397
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,631
But they'll go inside the fence but they're not as comfortable as they just

398
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,191
ESPN Wide Open

399
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,007
Few of them things we've learned to do

400
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
This, Mark that we're learning

401
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
The Eagles are still eating the chickens

402
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
But not quite as many chicken

403
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
Will says

404
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
This is probably the biggest pastured poultry business in the country in terms of numbers of birds on the ground

405
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:38,719
It's a new industry so there's a really steep learning curve

406
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,743
And the Eagles

407
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
