00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:05,376
Hey it's Robert Smith here we wanted to replay one of our favorite episodes today because

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,424
It seems super relevant

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,704
For what's about the

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:12,288
As you probably know our new President Donald J Trump

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,312
Love

6
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,336
To talk about

7
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
The Tariff

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,872
Tariffs

9
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,664
Taxes on Imports

10
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
And you want to use these terrorists mainly

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,248
As a threat

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
To keep factories in the United

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,624
You move manufacturing to a foreign country

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648
We will tax

15
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,208
The products when they come back that's a tariff

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,560
Now this idea was not invented by President Trump in fact

17
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,096
We have already lived

18
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
Through these kind of tariff

19
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:42,496
And we wanted to play the story of how one of the strangest tariffs of all time

20
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,080
Change the thing you may be inside of right now

21
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,104
The automobile

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,200
We do this podcast with NPR's car correspondence sonari glinton

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,272
And after supper will get update on where things stand right now

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,392
Alright Robert this is really exciting we're in Midtown Manhattan right across from Bryant Park

25
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,720
I don't want to try an experiment name

26
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
At the top of their head

27
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,560
As many mid-sized sedans as they know

28
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,400
Audi A7 BMW 5 Series

29
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,704
Ford Focus

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
Kia Spectra

31
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
Chevy Impala

32
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
Dodge Charger and BMW X5 BMW X3 the 4-series 435i

33
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,712
And Nissan Altima

34
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,832
Okay I got it like the answers would have run the gamut like we have foreign cars American cars lots of different cars

35
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
Exactly

36
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:35,232
But let's try something a little less easy how many pickup trucks they can name

37
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,536
Pickup truck pickup truck

38
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,608
Definitely

39
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,424
Well I guess it's the Ford F-150

40
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
Ford F-450 9550 whatever is going on a Ford F-150

41
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
Midnight

42
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,968
Ford F-150

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
I think I see where you're going with this which is when you talk about trucks were simply talking about American trucks the Ford F-150

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,904
Other American-made trucks

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
Nobody names of foreign truck

46
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
Exactly that's because

47
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
The American Truck

48
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:13,632
Jeff dominate the space I mean absolutely completely dominate the space

49
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,704
And there's a reason for that Robert the reason is chicken

50
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
And not just chicken

51
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
Frozen chicken parts shipped to Germany after World War II leaving will explain

Xcenda

83
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,784
It became sort of almost at craze

84
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832

Ford Chrysler

89
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
BMW GM again

90
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Everybody had to have

91
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,167
1 Beetle to Beetle said to have a beetle plus a Volkswagen bus

92
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,215
And it became a

93
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
I sort of a cult object

94
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,567
And I think everybody was worried about it

95
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,383
Well everybody who worked in the American Auto industry

96
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
She was worried about it

97
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
The meanwhile

98
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
Over in Germany

99
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,759
They're having their own sort of trade invasion

100
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,063
This is not cars this is as we promised

101
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
The chicken pox

102
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
Please remember up to this time

103
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,231
Chicken with sort of a luxury in Germany they were recovering from the war

104
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,047
And they had the wrong chicken manufacturers but they were really expensive

105
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
Incomes

106
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
Frozen

107
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
American

108
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Chicken

109
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
Frozen American Chicken on the Bountiful American Farms

110
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
Shipped over to Germany and all the sudden in Berlin

111
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,103
You can have chicken every night for dinner they are going crazy for in fact

112
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,175
We looked at the stats in 1961 alone

113
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
German chicken consumption

114
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
Went up 23%

115
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,087
If we were going crazy in United States for the Volkswagen Beetle

116
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
The Germans were going crazy for Americans

117
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,439
Yeah that's the dream of free trade

118
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
They get cheap chicken

119
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
We get cheap cars

120
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
It's a bonus for every

121
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Except

122
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
For the German

123
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Chicken farmers

124
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:30,751
What's the German chicken Farmers look around and they're expensive chickens are losing out to these cheap American

125
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
Big do what Farmers everywhere do

126
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,639
They went to their government and they said protect us against

127
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
Is cheap chicken

128
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
That's flooding the market

129
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
The German government responded

130
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,295
And they started attacks on American chicken

131
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Up to 50

132
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
80%

133
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
Which is huge

134
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
An American plague

135
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Wait wait wait wait wait

136
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,999
What we just helped rebuild you after the war

137
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
And you want to start

138
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
A trade dispute you attacks are chicken Vine

139
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
We will find some German things

140
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
If we can talk

141
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
It's basic playground Lodge

142
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Right

143
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
So the US plan

144
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
It's retaliation

145
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
They draft

146
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
This idea

147
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Advocate

148
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,175
John krafcik is with truecar.com

149
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,991
So in December of 1963

150
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
Lyndon Johnson become president

151
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,319
Less than two weeks before

152
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Signed into effect

153
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
This tariff

154
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
25% tariff

155
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
On

156
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,047
Vehicles that were deemed to be primarily commercial Goods

157
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Caring vehicle

158
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
The Chicken Shack

159
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
Actually called it

160
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
The chicken tax

161
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,447
These are pickup trucks and Commercial vans

162
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
And it's not just German pickup trucks

163
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
It's all foreign trucks

164
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
If you want to make a truck

165
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
And ship it to the US

166
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,919
You got to pay 25%

167
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Extra

168
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
It's called the chicken

169
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
Any change the American car industry

170
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Overnight

171
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,159
The first thing that happens is it foreign trucks are all of a sudden way too expensive

172
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
To compete

173
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
In this country

174
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
Volkswagen

175
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Had this pic

176
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,815
Basically it's a VW bus with a

177
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
The flatbed

178
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,423
And this was going to be there next big thing in America after

179
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:08,543
The Beetle and the regular size bus but once the chicken tax goes in it is 25%

180
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
More

181
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,919
Expensive to pulled from the market there like we can not sell this car this truck

182
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
In America

183
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
The American companies obviously happy there's less competition

184
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,599
It also allowed the American car companies assertive

185
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,927
Kick back and relax a little bit not really in a vape

186
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
Because of the chicken tax American trucks

187
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
Basically

188
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Stayed the same of the year

189
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,375
They got bigger they got fancy or they certainly got more expensive

190
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
Foreign competition

191
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,727
Don't want to watch a new ideas in the space

192
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
Adjective

193
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Hyundai

194
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
And have the opportunity to build

195
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
I know some

196
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
Funky

197
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,455
Fuel efficient truck they brought to America that would have inspired American manufactured vehicle on

198
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Competing with Hyundai

199
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
But there was

200
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,527
No foreign car

201
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
It was no incentive

202
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,647
Once you put a tariff on something The Innovation that would have gone into the product

203
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
Goes into getting around matera

204
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
And that's what the car company started to do

205
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
Robert things got really crazy really quickly

206
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Toyota

207
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,911
So we can't directly ship our trucks from Japan

208
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
I'll tell you what we'll do

209
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,263
We'll build them in Parts giant parts

210
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,567
They ship them to the US

211
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,895
And then slap those parts together put them on the train

212
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
And there you go

213
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
They got around the chicken

214
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,063
Because technically they were assembling the car even though the parts from in Japan they were assembling

215
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
In the United States

216
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
Tighten a couple of screws

217
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Made in America

218
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Good2Go

219
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
And US Customs look like

220
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Yeah I know

221
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
That's not

222
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
That's not going to play

223
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,863
It'll sure all the foreign car manufacturers at this point just gave up trying to get around

224
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,983
Of course not because this is America the most important market for any kind

225
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
Of course

226
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,103
Subaru which is a great car maker they make SUVs

227
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Why not make a truck

228
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
So they didn't hear you

229
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,967
I'm sure you remember the Subaru Brat

230
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,319
Subaru Brat my neighbor had one of these it was amazing from 50 feet away

231
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
It looks like a pickup

232
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
When you got up close

233
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
There were these

234
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
2

235
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
Flimsy plastic sheets

236
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
Just bolted into the bed of the truck

237
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,375
The idea was well those seats are for people there for it

238
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Must not be

239
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,751
A vehicle that is designed to carry Goods I thought it was a it was a very clever solution

240
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,847
Because government did not think this was a clever solution then post the chicken tax and

241
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
In the brat

242
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Went away

243
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:25,503
As time goes by in the Global Auto industry gets more interconnected and complicated

244
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
You can't parse out necessarily

245
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,623
Which is an American company which is a foreign company because

246
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,951
Say a company like Ford makes cars and trucks on five continents

247
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
And all the sudden

248
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,119
American companies started to encounter the same problem for companies where which American companies had to deal with the chicken

249
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
What makes a cargo van in Europe

250
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
It's called

251
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
But I didn't want that to happen

252
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
So what they did was

253
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
They took the cargo van

254
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
Put some seats where the cargo is supposed to go

255
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:57,247
Shipped it to the US and said hey that's not a cargo van that's a passenger van

256
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
The chicken tax

257
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Doesn't apply

258
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
Is Sean McClendon from the center for Automotive Research

259
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,439
And when they get here to the United States still say Ohio

260
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,327
The rip the seats out punch out the windows and covering with metal panels and resell the vehicle is a free

261
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,399
And it's cheaper to do that then pay the Tariff

262
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
After they took the seats out

263
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
They sent them back to Europe

264
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
Put them in another van

265
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
And shipped back to us

266
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Be taken out again

267
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,663
Over and over and over again in his vicious and virtuous cycle

268
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
All this trade

269
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Make sound

270
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
Liking Santa Baby is insanity

271
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
But the end of the day the chicken tax

272
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
Accomplished exactly what it was

273
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Supposed to

274
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Accomplish which is

275
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
The dominance of the American

276
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,791
American trucks own the road and they have

277
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
For 50 years

278
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
Everyone agrees in American culture now

279
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
So good have had such a

280
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
So long

281
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
But even if you got rid of the chicken

282
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
It would take

283
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,335
Years and years and years for the rest of the world

284
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
To catch up with American

285
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,663
And that's the question I've been having for years

286
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
If American trucks are so good

287
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,527
Why is the 25% chicken tax

288
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
Dylan place

289
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,647
At the most recent Detroit Auto Show I got to speak to Mark Fields

290
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
The brand new CEO of Ford Motor

291
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
And right before I talk to him

292
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,327
It just unveiled what almost every Ford executive would call

293
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
The most important rock that come out of the tray

294
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
50 years

295
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,959
Awesome

296
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Why do you still need the chicken tax

297
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,823
Well in terms of the

298
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,639
Clearly when you look where we're free Traders

299
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,199
Fire by Design

300
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,015
We have been the best selling vehicle in the US

301
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
433

302
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,879
When we want to make sure we're on a Level Playing Field and right now around the world

303
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,927
Not so level depending

304
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
And you think it's fine you want it you want to keep it

305
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
You need it though that's

306
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,607
I thought you know that it's on the books right now

307
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
And yeah we want

308
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
That's the reality that we're dealing with

309
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,007
Robert let me translate that for you

310
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
What are you saying is

311
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,615
We don't really need the chicken tax

312
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,663
But we are going to demand that we get rid of it

313
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
After all

314
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
EBenefits

315
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,295
I thought that went so well why stop at one cu

316
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
Let's go on to the next

317
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,159
So I talked to Sergio marchione he's the head of the FCA

318
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
Which is the owner of

319
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
Chrysler

320
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,023
And this is where it gets weird because

321
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
This company is

322
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
European company

323
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
An American

324
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,447
It's also harm by it as well

325
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,007
I'm the wrong guy to ask that question

326
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
Because I would not have to check

327
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
But that's just my view

328
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
What why not

329
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,967
I mean you're in charge of an American car company

330
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Number

331
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:43,647
We benefit when you run a global organization the chicken Texas and Incredibly protective measure Define deal with

332
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,511
I think Anil perceived threat to the stability of the auto sector I don't think it does

333
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,863
But it exists so it's going to take a while to try and taking out taking off the table

334
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Finally

335
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,703
How much of an interesting question why would you ask

336
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
All the taxes you could be at

337
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Because it's weird

338
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,079
It's weird that this

339
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
Tariff

340
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Exist

341
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
I mean

342
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
Why not compete on a completely even

343
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Plainfield

344
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,783
You sound pretty good to me I like your story I didn't say anything

345
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
I'm not the guy that invented the chicken thanks

346
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
If I comply with it

347
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
Do I need to check the text answers no

348
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
Even with

349
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
CEO double

350
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
I'm not hearing this guy saying like we are going to die

351
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
As companies

352
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
Without the chip

353
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
Well of course not because they have such a

354
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Names of the people who buy pickups

355
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,895
It would take forever to break that bond with the American pickups

356
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
And that's the funny thing about

357
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Tariffs

358
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Which is

359
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
What's the score of the place

360
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,063
There's no real incentive to get rid of them

361
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,879
Even if you do not need the tariffs anymore

362
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
They stick around

363
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,999
And there's a really important reason for this which is once you have a tariff

364
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
It becomes a bargaining chip

365
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
It becomes something you can use

366
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,863
In the next set of training

367
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
I just didn't know here it's been

368
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,983
2 years since we recorded

369
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,799
That podcast and like clockwork

370
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,127
Hillary Clinton just got back from the Detroit Auto Show history

371
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Hey how's it going

372
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
Don't do it and you're still thinking about the chicken tax

373
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
It's still a thing in the oven

374
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,855
It is very much still a thing in the Auto industry and actually

375
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
Listening to the Kurt

376
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,999
Intimations of Sergio marchione the CEO of

377
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
Fiat Chrysler Group

378
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
It's interesting cuz

379
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
GM along with the other

380
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
American CEOs of

381
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
The car company

382
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,239
Met with President Trump about

383
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
Manufacturing in the USA

384
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,615
Donald Trump talks a lot

385
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
About

386
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,943
Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs he talks about

387
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,783
Perhaps renegotiating NAFTA the North American Free Trade Agreement

388
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
And

389
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
The chicken tax

390
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
Sleeve into that right

391
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
Yeah exactly because

392
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
One of the things that NAFTA dead

393
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Was

394
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
The industry

395
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
At least our neighbors thought

396
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
This tariff is kind of crazy

397
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
One of the things that NAFTA

398
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,959
Should have erased if you are an apt the country

399
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
You don't have to pay the chicken

400
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,823
So that's why a Ford F-150

401
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,359
The aluminum body

402
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
Hilton Mexico

403
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
And then assembled

404
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
I finally

405
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Here in the US

406
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Ram

407
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
Build a lot of its trucks

408
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
In Mexico as those Chevy

409
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,159
In part because it's so close

410
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,231
To Texas which is where a lot of pickup trucks

411
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Bought and sold

412
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,351
You don't interesting scenery because sometimes I think that only those of us

413
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Planet Money

414
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
Really are obsessed with

415
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
Tiny little weird tariffs

416
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
The past

417
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,847
But if you renegotiate current trade deals as the president wants to do

418
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,687
They're all in there all of this stuff is going to start to come to light again

419
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
Lake Erie open big trade agreements

420
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
Like now that you're going to have to

421
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Re-litigate

422
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
All of these

423
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
All these shoes again

424
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,183
We think about Robert I have to say I've spent

425
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
5 1/2 years

426
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:05,119
And my Chopper last five years have been the tremendous success of the Auto industry

427
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,143
And there's a sphere

428
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,703

429
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,727
