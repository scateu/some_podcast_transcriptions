1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,072
Vanessa Hall Harper seems like one of those

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,864
People who are always in a hurry always

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,632
Rushing

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:10,240
She walks into the public library in North Tulsa Oklahoma caring this holder that is

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,032
Completely staffed with papers

6
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,664
Yep this is my Bible

7
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:23,552
In that folder is everything that Vanessa Hall Harper needed

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,088
To fight the fight of her life

9
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,392
So it's just everything

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
Totally unorganized

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,048
Vanessa is from North Tulsa and there's one issue that's been on her mind

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
4 years

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,352
North Tulsa

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,888
Does not have a gross

15
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,448
Got plenty of churches in

16
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,496
Liquor stores like most

17
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,544
You know disenfranchised communities

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,824
Vanessa works

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
In public health

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,176
And so she knows that people who live in North Tulsa

21
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,016
Die 12 years earlier than people who live in self

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,064
And food is apart of

23
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,392
She decides to run for City Council on a platform

24
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,672
Promising to

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,976
Bring a grocery store to North Tulsa

26
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
I started

27
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
Noticing

28
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,120
That anytime there was any development whatsoever

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,424
In my community it was a it was a discount.

30
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,240
And I'm trying to figure out what is going on

31
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
Dollar Store

32
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,824
They keep popping up in North

33
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
Literally within a few blocks of each

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,688
And they were just popping up popping up popping up

35
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
I'm saying this has to have an effect

36
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,040
On the ability of a grocery store

37
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
To come in

38
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
NBC

39
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,160
Successful because even though dollar stores are not grocery stores

40
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,768
They do sell groceries like pasta and cereal and yeah those things that are horrible for you

41
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
Diabetes and all those

42
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Yes

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912
Dollar stores don't usually sell fruit

44
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
Or vegetables or meat

45
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
That is not where the profit is

46
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
Grocery say they don't make the real money selling

47
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,176
Carrots and lettuce they make the real money selling twinkies and Cheetos in like

48
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Paper towels

49
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
And dollar stores

50
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
They really only sell those

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
High-profit items

52
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
So at this point there are already

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,928
$10 stores in Vanessa's District

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
End in XI dollar store is asked

55
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
Sushi slike

56
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Hold on

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
Let's not approve this just yet

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
I actually think this is going to make it

59
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
Harder for me to get a girl

60
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,704
Grocery store in here

61
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,056
That was a couple of councilors of like what there's no studies to show that what you're saying is is accurate

62
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
I don't need no damn study

63
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,248
Okay I have common sense hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Sarah Gonzales

64
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Can I know Elle King

65
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
Today on the show

66
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Should we hate

67
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Dollar Store

68
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,440
This year a brand new dollar store will open up

69
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
Every six

70
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Hours

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
They're more than $30,000 stores in the United

72
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,864
That's more than there are Walmart

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
McDonald's and CVS stores combined dollar stores are everywhere and they are sitting up in places that

74
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
No one else will go

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
Tiny towns urban areas

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,664
So are they feeling a need

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,784
Or is the Dollar Store take over destroying something more valuable

78
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,184

Flashlight

95
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,992
Okay Vanessa Hall Harper has $10 stores in North Tulsa and she wants to consider preventing it

96
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
And 11th from coming

97
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,832
I didn't all of Tulsa just in her District

98
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
The Northside

99
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
But she needs the support

100
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
The whole city

101
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:16,768
Instead the local Chamber of Commerce calls her anti-business

102
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,399
And Vanessa's like I'm not anti-business I'm just saying we should have at least one other type of this

103
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
I was told this is illegal you can't do this

104
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,823
Daddy know I don't think it's possible I think this is illegal you know we're going to get sued and blah blah blah

105
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
And I don't care about getting sued as long as we won

106
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,711
And that's not necessarily the

107
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
The position of some

108
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,831
People and blue department and I get it you know they don't want to invite

109
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Litigation

110
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
But

111
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
And my opinion is I told him that your job

112
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
You did this is called the legal department

113
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
It's your job to protect

114
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
Do you have a lot of friends in

115
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
City government

116
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,471
Yes I have a lot of friends a lot of free

117
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,751
Not

118
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,895
Cities don't like to just say no to new business

119
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
So they approve the 11th

120
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
Dollar Store the one that Vanessa was fighting

121
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
And her reaction is hilarious

122
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,855
She starts protesting outside telling people

123
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
Don't come to this Dollar Store

124
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
At least go to the one across

125
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
We never wanted

126
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,583
This one day even though she had lost the 11th Dollar Store battle

127
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
She was still fighting the dollar store

128
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
I said really

129
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
Software to do my research

130
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
There are three main dollar store chains

131
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:38,175
Dollar Tree sets up in the suburbs everything they sell cost exactly $1

132
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,039
And Family Dollar and Dollar General open up in urban and rural area

133
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,343
They sell everything from canned foods

134
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
Too close and

135
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Toaster oven

136
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
Not all for a dollar but generally added it

137
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,767
They're like mini Walmarts for towns Walmart ignore

138
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
And dollar stores also employed

139
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
If you were p

140
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,447
If you don't need someone making sure the chicken didn't go bad or the tomatoes are not shriveled up

141
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
You can operate with

142
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Much leaner staff

143
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,871
On average dollar stores employ nine people when local grocery stores employee 40

144
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,943
The dollar store that is growing the fastest

145
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,479
Is Dollar General

146
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
They have 15000 472 stores in this country that was as of March

147
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
March 1st

148
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
By comparison Walmart has about 5000

149
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
Dollar General turn down our request

150
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,095
For a recorded interview but they did tell us

151
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
That they know they're cuss

152
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,239
And that their customers are only willing to travel about three to five miles to shop

153
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,567
With them and that is why they open up stores so close to each other

154
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,127
And all of this could mean that the market is

155
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,479
People are shopping at Dollar Stores voting for what they want

156
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
With their dollars

157
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
But sometimes

158
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
People vote for what they want

159
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
With their votes

160
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
At The Ballot Box

161
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,487
And in North Tulsa they elected Vanessa Hall Harper

162
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,791
Specifically to bring a grocery

163
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Vanessa keeps building her case that

164
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
Dollar stores keep grocery stores from surviving

165
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,495
And she finds out about a guy in the town of Haven Kansas

166
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
A couple hours now

167
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Doug net

168
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
My title was president

169
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
Your table now

170
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
Funky

171
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
Clean up guy so

172
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,623
Doug is unlocking what's left of his grocery store

173
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
Wow I don't think I've ever seen it

174
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
Empty grocery store

175
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
The deceased to have a

176
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
Bananas

177
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
Onion remnants

178
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
Onion petals on the bottom

179
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
This was the only grocery store in town

180
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
Haven Kansas has about a thousand Reza

181
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
It's a Tiny Town surrounded by fields

182
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
And for Dollar General

183
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
It was a perfect Market

184
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,711
Most of their stores are in towns with less

185
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
Then 20,000 resume

186
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
They set up point

187
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
3 miles

188
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
From Doug store

189
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,903
The first day Dollar General open we lost

190
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Almost 7

191
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
Hundred dollars in sales

192
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,767
Veterinary not advertise any

193
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
Beijing today

194
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:07,935
And Doug would go in and he would walk around the Dollar General he would check out the competition

195
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:14,335
I'd look at their prices I happen to notice one day that they were selling at 14 and a half ounce can of Campbell's chick

196
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Chicken noodle soup Cambridge

197
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Soup

198
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
$4

199
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
So I come back down here and I call

200
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:26,111
My warehouse caught this new guy and says this same can is costing me

201
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
From my supplier

202
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Freight delivered

203
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
To the store here

204
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
About a dollar fifty

205
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
And mine is only 11 1/2 ounces

206
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
He called his Campbell Soup represent even asking

207
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
Why is this about we only make

208
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Get for them

209
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
And we only make it in 14 1/2 ounce can

210
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
Specifically for Dollar General

211
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Zip code for Dollar General

212
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,991
Dollar General Buys in bulk so Campbell's will make some things for them cheaper

213
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,319
Does cheaper products are great for regular shoppers

214
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
But they are not great for duck

215
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
People were still shopping at Doug's

216
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,487
The store though he had held on to 70% of his business

217
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,303
They were choosing to spend a lot of their grocery money

218
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,607
With Doug although to put it another way

219
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
He had lost about a third of his business

220
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,983
We just went down and it was nothing ever we never

221
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Whenever

222
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Popped up

223
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
He couldn't keep the lights on

224
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Had to close

225
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,407
Pho always just hates Eclipse you tell me

226
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,295
I've stood I've said here for 972 days or whatever losing $700 a day

227
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
In sales

228
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
What do you want me to do what can I do

229
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,999
For Vanessa Hall Harper back in North Tulsa

230
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
This was the perfect

231
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Dollar Store horse

232
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,143
But she needed hard evidence of a connection

233
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
And then

234
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,751
One big grocery store chain gave her the evidence

235
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
They were interested in coming to North Tulsa

236
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
But they actually told them

237
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:56,991
If you're just going to have dollar stores popping up constantly forever in this District it might not be worth it

238
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
They had written this letter and I'll read it

239
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
While we welcome healthy company

240
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,719
It is our opinion that a market oversaturated with small convenience

241
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,047
Type dollar stores would negatively affect honor capital

242
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:10,815
Ability

243
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
Shoe stores throughout Tulsa

244
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Underserved

245
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
Coastway Community than this

246
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,983
I mean this was very instrumental this is a grocer

247
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
What they're saying is

248
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,311
The market is already crowded

249
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
So Vanessa is like

250
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
How can we legally

251
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
Keep it from getting worse

252
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,551
And you know who's really good at getting the businesses they want and keeping out the ones they don't want

253
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Wealthy town

254
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,879
She learns about a city in Southern California

255
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
Coronado

256
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
That has what's called

257
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Formula business

258
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
Formula businesses are chain

259
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,887
And in that Community they had a policy in place

260
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,543
That at no time will there ever be more than 10 national chain stores I don't care if it was a McDonald's burger king whatever

261
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,847
Any national brand no more than 10

262
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
It so that was the commitment

263
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,687
Visiting Coronado got sued

264
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
What they want

265
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,063
And now Vanessa has a real life example of a city restricting business

266
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
On the grounds that it is

267
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
Good for the city

268
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,439
And there are actually a bunch of cities I do this

269
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,535
Restricting chains in particular isn't what Vanessa wanted but it was

270
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
Similar

271
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,375
She still had to convince the zoning and legal

272
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,727
They held to public meetings in Vanessa's district and finally were like

273
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Okay

274
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
People want this

275
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Here's what they come up with

276
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,615
No Dollar Store can open up

277
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,687
Within a mile of an existing Dollar Store

278
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
Dollar Store Zone

279
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
We identified

280
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Existing store

281
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,087
Input a one mile radius circle around it

282
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,647
There's no more room for any more disk

283
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
So there is no

284
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
Place in North Tulsa

285
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
Where a dollar store

286
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Open up

287
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,911
That will be a mile away from another dollar store not in these boundaries

288
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,215
Is correct so this one mile

289
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,311
Marker is really the the loophole that you found

290
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,639
To prevent any new stores from coming cuz there is no space

291
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
Exactly because they proliferated so

292
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
I already

293
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
What Vanessa really wanted was for people to have access to

294
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,063
2 healthy food

295
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:12,927
Big picture so their proposal would also sweeten the deal for grocery stores

296
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,231
Normally they have to have a lot of parking spaces

297
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
This would cut the number of spaces

298
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,583
Also people with

299
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
Community garden

300
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
They would be able to

301
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
Sell any produce they grow

302
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,007
Right out of the garden no permit required

303
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799
That's not allowed anywhere else

304
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
So the proposal comes up for a vote and the people of North Tulsa Pac into City Hall

305
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
I have to cut you off

306
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
Because this is

307
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
We're talking about the other side

308
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
And I know

309
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,695
It gets pretty contentious one person is like look the $11 store

310
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
Heard your protest they offer some fruits and such

311
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Sports now

312
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,095
And we are choosing to shop there

313
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
In spite of it being

314
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
Boycott it

315
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Protest

316
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Is it against

317
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
The Northside residence

318
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,847
Is patronizing the same

319
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Dollar General

320
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,711
Now the city councillors are listening to this their hearing everyone out

321
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,527
And they're also raising their own concern

322
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
One of them who has a background in economics is like

323
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,951
This sounds like fences this sounds like preventing busy

324
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
That's not good

325
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,071
Another city counselor thought the proposal just didn't have enough detail

326
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,167
From me the the hard part

327
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
Of this

328
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
His employee

329
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,727
Please don't start throwing

330
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
Tomatoes

331
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
If I got at me I don't have tomatoes it would have

332
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,871
Don't try throwing Cheetos

333
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
Packages of Twinkies

334
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
Okay okay okay

335
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
I can't vote

336
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
In favor of

337
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Yes

338
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
Limiting dollar stores

339
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Barely

340
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
5 divorce

341
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
In effect

342
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,703
No more dollar stores can open up in North

343
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Tulsa

344
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,031
Of course the dollar stores don't give up that easily

345
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,127
Two new ones open up right on the edge of the restricted area in North

346
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,967
But this Dollar Store ban started to resonate all over the

347
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Newark

348
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
North St Louis

349
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,111
Haskins Ohio the all called Vanessa Hall Harper saying

350
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,183
We have too many dollar stores to how can we do what you do

351
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,279
Mesquite City Texas just went ahead and pass the restrictions right away

352
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:30,143
And what North Tulsa did is make room in the market for a grocery

353
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
Restore they're trying to

354
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,239
Prop up a business that hasn't worked in the free market

355
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,591
But North Tulsa is still a market in order for a grocery store

356
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
To survive

357
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,687
It will have to be better than the $11 stores

358
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:48,831
Coming up after the break how one grocery store made one of the most Charming changes we've ever heard of

359
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855

Candice the wheat capital of the world

00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
A place so quiet

378
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
You can hear the grass

379
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
In the Wind

380
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,703
It's a farming town with about a thousand resume

381
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,311
Jenny oxner and her husband Clint own the only grocery store in

382
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Where

383
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
Homegrown that's what we liked

384
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
So high school sweetheart

385
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
Really

386
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
Are you a cheerleader

387
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,087
Maybe

388
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
Sweethearts built their store from the ground up

389
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,719
Ben Dollar General decided to open up

390
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,767
Right in front of their store

391
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Like

392
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Here we are

393
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
Your competition

394
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Writing process

395
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
The Oscars

396
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,447
Saw their sales start to decline

397
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
And they decided to compete

398
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Now they're open later and they work

399
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
Longer on Sunday

400
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
And all of this is good for consumers

401
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,991
I needed that because of the competition they extended your hours

402
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,319
Yeah we figured we needed to because they're ours weren't

403
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,111
What they should have been in the beginning

404
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
We know we should

405
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,463
She probably be open till 9 in the summer everyday but

406
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
We

407
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,559
Still like that little bit of family time that we have left

408
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
And they've tried to find a niche

409
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,191
Something they have that Dollar General

410
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Doesn't

411
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
Like

412
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,543
The coldest refrigerator in town

413
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,615
Are milk coolers very cold it's very well refrigerated and so

414
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,431
Coldest milk in town coldest beer in town

415
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,271
We take pride in that cold is milk and

416
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,831
And sometimes it's whatever works right and that works

417
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,135
Express also have

418
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
Pretty intense

419
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
We do it

420
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Boneless

421
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
Barbecued baby back ribs

422
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,631
Weave bone out Boston butts a lot of times

423
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,679
It just takes a little extra time

424
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
Bone out Boston butt

425
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,287
Yeah that's a butcher term I guess

426
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,871
And look there are examples of grocery stores surviving dollars

427
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Just like they survive warmer

428
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
Which Jenny and Clinton

429
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
What dollar stores are differ

430
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,575
Walmart is cheap but dollar stores have this way of making us

431
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,159
Feel like they're way cheaper I means they're called dollar store is

432
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,231
But they're not always a good deal when you compare prices

433
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Is pound-for-pound

434
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Celtics

435
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Back in North Tulsa

436
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,935
Vanessa's long battle to bring fruits and vegetables and meat to her neighborhood

437
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
It worked

438
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
You have a grocery store

439
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
Yes but you know who they are

440
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
Yes I just can't say it yet

441
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
But it's a done deal

442
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,175
When we breaking ground hopefully

443
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Late summer

444
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
So yeah

445
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,295
They did also get some Federal grant money for their grocery

446
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,391
As Eva District that has $11 stores

447
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
Do you think

448
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
That that grocery store will be able to survive

449
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
When it has 11

450
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
Dollar types

451
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Stores to compete with

452
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,679
Yes we are very hopeful that it will

453
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,519
Because I'm going to educate and work and encourage my constituents

454
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,055
Look if we don't support the

455
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:26,687
Restore we won't have it and you'll still be complaining about the same thing you've been complaining about for the last 10 years

456
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
That we don't have quality course

457
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Community

458
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
Something's in the grocery store will be more expensive than the dollar type

459
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
Vape stores

460
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,231
But we as consumers regularly pay more for the things we want including low-income

461
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Like

462
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,607
We might pay more for the coldest milk in town

463
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,447
And people in North Tulsa might be a couple cents more to have access

464
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
To the vegetables

465
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
They like mustard greens

466
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
That is what Vanessa really want

00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,463

Do you have things wrapped in newspaper

You can have them

489
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,167
This is the beauty of the receipts

490
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
24 items $25 and ninety

491
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:32,127
