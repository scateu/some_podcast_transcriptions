The following message come from The UPS Store

00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,888
Offering services from shredding

5
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,168
To printing to mailbox

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,472
And instead of closing this Memorial Day we

7
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,264
May 24th and 25th

8
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
The UPS Store

9
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,568
He's doing another thing

10
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
All together

11
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Opening

12
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
The UPS Store

13
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,176
Everything for small business

14
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,712
And of course shipping

15
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,808
Hey it's Jacob Goldstein Today Show is a rerun

16
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:28,672
It was first reported by Caitlin Kenney and David kestenbaum back in 2014

17
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
Redis

18
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,768
When you go to website and you type in

19
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:36,096
Whatever amazon.com facebook.com Jose

20
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
Pizza.com

21
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,216
Did you ever wonder how we ended up with. Cam is the ending

22
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,032
It turned out you have to go back to the earliest days of the year

23
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,824
I tracked down one of the founders

24
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,640
Is it right you were present when the internet was created

25
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
Yeah

26
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
But

27
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,576
Livy try to be careful about this

28
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:03,232
This is Steve Crocker it turns out like all things internet the creation of the internet itself was a

29
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
Collaboration

30
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,560
Cracker was a grad student in the 1960

31
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,120
These and back in those days every computer

32
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
Was separate

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
But there was this idea

34
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,288
What if you could string wires between each one and work out some way for them to communicate

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
Then they could send stuff back in

36
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,920
The project that Cracker worked on was called the arpanet

37
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,736
They managed to hook up for computers at different universities

38
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,064
You're sitting at 1 and he wanted to communicate with another

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
It was really very barebone

40
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
You didn't type a name for that

41
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
You have to just use a number

42
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
UCLA was one

43
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
That's where I was to

44
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
UCSB Santa Barbara was three and Utah was for and I'm being absolutely literal

45
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,216
Does he like connect to number one connect

46
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
The number to

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
Exactly so

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
Things quickly got more complicated more and more

49
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Computers got added

50
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:56,224
Previous attempts have been to connect two or three computers together and by those standards this was enormous

51
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
How many computers

52
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:02,368
Well it started out with four and then quickly grew to 15 and then grew to 50

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,720
It is of course a pain to have to remember those numbers so someone writes

54
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
Few lines of computer code

55
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
Announce

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
You don't have to remember a mighty is

57
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Sex

58
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
You just type MIT

59
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
So even computer people

60
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,960
Prefer to have letters

61
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
The numbers

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Yes

63
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,872
Computer people really are just like everybody else there people

64
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,432
This it turns out was only a temporary fix

65
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,968
The number of computers connected

66
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,760
Grew to the hundreds and more

67
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,624
Someone needed to take charge to build a new naming system to bring order to the growing cast

68
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
And its historic task

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Was given to

70
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
Paul mockapetris

71
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Who

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Just got to be

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,096
You know the only reason I got the job was nobody thought it was

74
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
Important until we tell him to

75
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
HD let's get him though.

76
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
This John

77
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,752
Call said there was this big debate going on

78
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,592
Some people wanted this internet thing organized by country other people say

79
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
Come on let's be more International

80
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
Let's group things by

81
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,248
Until the idea of ending web addresses with

82
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,040
A. And then a few letters

83
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
But remember at the time the internet was much smaller

84
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,440
And it was just seeing if this thing for governments and University

85
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Again Steve Crocker

86
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
He had

87
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,656
Don't kneel for the military portion of the US government. Gov for the civilian side

88
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,960
Dot edu for universities and then

89
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:26,592
For those few commercials companies that happen to be part of it a little catch all called.com

90
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,456
Quartz down some major property

91
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
Dot-com was born

92
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
C o m

93
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
PetSmart commercial

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Companies

95
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
I asked Paul mockapetris who actually came up

96
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,768
You know I've had about three sets of people asked me to testify to the fact that they did it and I don't

97
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Don't really know

98
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,632
Caitlin you I was expecting something to say I just wrote it down on a napkin

99
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,032
Yeah it's funny to me though cuz I actually never thought that it stood for anything

100
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
I've just been so used to typing.com my whole life

101
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,992
Actually never thought about what.com

102
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,552
For reason it's crazy that it is at

103
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:12,416
This little Quirk it ended up having really big consequences for the internet because think about it

104
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
Everybody wants

105
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
The good names

106
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
The.com name

107
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Like

108
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
Imagine you have a business and it's called Jose p

109
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Pizza

110
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,655
So the first person who gets on the internet gets Jose p

111
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
Pizza.com that's it they're good they have a nice

112
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Trine website name

113
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,335
But then all the other Joe's pizzas out there all across the US

114
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,919
They have to add words and letters they have to become Big Joe's Pizza

115
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Pizza.com

116
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,759
Joe's Pizza on 7th. Com Happy Joes.

117
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
Tomato Joe's Pizza. Com

118
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,391
You went out Joe's Pizza of the village.

119
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,487
Is that one's easy to remember so for the people who were not first or not

120
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Some of them

121
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,559
Have had to pay big money

122
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
People who got

123
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Simple web

124
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,215
Toys R Us Princeton bought toys.com for $5000000

125
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
S****** sold for 13

126
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,359
This is the reason you know the photo sharing websites liquor

127
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
It's actually spelled

128
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,711
Flickr

129
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,039
Because the guy who owned the domain

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
The flicker with the e.com

131
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,415
You wouldn't sell it to the people and they love to the name for their company

132
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
So their solution was

133
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
Drop the e

134
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,023
Sometimes you got to do that to find a little space

135
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
That hasn't been taken

136
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
There are currently over a hundred million website sanding and.

137
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Which is one reason

138
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
Right now

139
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191

New options for website names not only is there. Calm and. Gov

Their settlers

152
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
And a new land baron

153
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911

This world of online web addresses the rules for it are set by a

172
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
A nonprofit group

173
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
You called I can

What a boring sound is his nonprofit group it supposed to be like an impartial caretaker

177
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:11,615
And after a long many year process of discussing pros and cons and Pros in after open forum

178
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
Arms in position papers and listening to

Had to say

181
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
They decided

182
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
It was time for noon

183
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,551
Those last letters that you type on a web address

184
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
Dot-com that's called a top-level domain

185
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,439
And basically they're going to allow all kinds of new top-level

186
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,279
If you're I can this is a kind of hard thing to explain to the public

187
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
Their best effort is this little

188
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,351
Cartoon called

189
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
The dot has friends

190
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
Starting with little animated

191
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
Miley.

192
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Is flying around it

193
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Rocket ship

194
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,543
The diet is making new friends

195
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,431
More than 1300 of them and they're going to change the internet like never before

196
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:53,087
Madden classic internet fashion anybody wanted to get one of these new top-level domains one of the new pieces of Real Estate

197
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
They can apply

198
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
And try to develop it

199
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
YouTube I say. Menu for example

200
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
And try to sell it to restaurant

201
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
She wanted websites ending in. Menu

202
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,143
Think of it Joe's Pizza. Menu Kaitlyn's Cafe. Menu

203
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,727
Think of it as an internet Island just for restaurants and their menus

204
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,799
Or instead of that menu you could apply for

205
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
You know. Cat

206
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
Whatever you want

207
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,711
When Adrian McAdory heard about this she thought I am definitely apply

208
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
But I'm couple years ago she was working

209
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
The Pentagon

210
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
Choose a contractor doing

211
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,439
Nike work and I read on the internet that the internet was expanding you actually like at work at the Pentagon

212
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
Thinking about the oh yeah in the basement

213
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:37,887
Fender Bassman in the basement of his basement Pentagon in the dungeon with the where the rest of us peons work

214
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
But then she had this question

215
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
Which domain

216
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Should I apply for

217
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:48,383
I was thinking about lifestyle let you know where do something with lifestyle and so then you know my girlfriends and I just having sex in Converse

218
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
Can I get a boba

219
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
That's it she thought weddings

220
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
. wedi

221
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
Wet people can put all their wedding pages

222
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
Adrian Martin. Wagner

223
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
John. Wed John and John. Webb

224
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
People would pay for those kinds of sites

225
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
So she applied

226
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
Sending a really long

227
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
An application there is

228
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,887
$185,000 fee

229
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Choose some

230
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Retirement money

231
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
And her dad helped out

232
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
And finally. Wed was her

233
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,615
The thing about owning one of these domains is that once you get it you're like the mayor

234
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
You can set the rules

235
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
And one of Adrian's rules

236
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:28,319
Is listen sweetie I know you love your spouse but you can't hold on to that wedding webpage forever

237
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
This she says will be enforced in the following way

238
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,463
Price to own a. Website for the first year 70 bucks

239
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Second gear

240
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,255
70 box

241
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
30 year

242
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
$30,000

243
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
That is because we want you to

244
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,191
Move on into the sunset and live happily ever after

245
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,495
And let the next Mary and John have that fight

246
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,823
She figures if 6000 couples in Love by websites

247
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
She'll break you

248
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,687
Nothing about setting your own rules that's part of the appeal of these new domain

249
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,503
New York for instance has. NYC

250
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,807
So we can require that all businesses

251
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
Want to use that

252
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
Have to actually be in New York

253
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
If you buy. Kids

254
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,231
You can pledge to make it totally Kids Safe material

255
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,279
A lot of the New Deal made the targeting very

256
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
But a couple people are thinking

257
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
I mean really why restrict yourself to

258
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
You can try to become the next

259
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
The next all purpose in

260
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
Thing you can stick on the back of any business

261
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
After all, is pretty crowded

262
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:28,223
All of the good real estate has taken the only thing that's left is something with a dash in

263
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
Or maybe three dashes and a couple numbers in it

264
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,599
This is Daniel McGarry he's 28 years old

265
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,671
As far as he knows the youngest person to be granted one of the new domain

266
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,487
Is Mom and some fraternity Brothers at helping him out

267
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,559
His Contender to take on.com is

268
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Dot X

269
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
YZ

270
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
The way I looked at it was we on the alphabet was XYZ was

271
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Domain names

272
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
The same way

273
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
XYZ Universal yet

274
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Abstract

275
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
And catchy

276
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Try and forget it I dare you

277
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
XY

278
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Ax

279
00:10:59,455 --> 00:10:59,967
You're right

280
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,831
XYZ it's it just sticks is it it's natural that really makes sense

281
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
About QRS

282
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
Doesn't make sense to me

283
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,535
The only one ending to the alphabet and there should only be one ending to a domain name

284
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Good job working at indigo

285
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
And he tells me if I want my own personal slice

286
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
David. XYZ

287
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Still available

288
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,335
And if you think of it like a land rush

289
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,175
Daniel and Adrian with that wed they're kind of like Pioneers with

290
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Covered wagon

291
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
Finding a little plot of land

292
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
Hoping to start a town

293
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
And convince people to move there

294
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,879
They're standing there saying come live here it's awesome

295
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
It'll be so easy for friends and

296
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
Customers to come and visit

297
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,999
Are individuals

298
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Taking a chance

299
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,351
But they're up against some very big developers who are buying up huge swath

300
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,959
Daniel Schindler has been the internet named business for a long time and some other folks

301
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
Raise what he told me was

302
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,311
Significantly over 100 million dollars

303
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
To fire a whole list

304
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
The clever internet

305
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,199
That wine. Cool. Coffee

306
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,855
307 with a number of new demands we applied for

307
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
It's a lot we were the largest applicant

308
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,767
In the world by a factor of 3 Google was there

309
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
Second largest applicant 101

310
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:25,471
I asked him do we really need all this new real estate I mean how often do people really even type in web addresses by hand

311
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,567
Why do people get where they're going using a search engine or following a link on some

312
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,943
How do we feel type in www. Blah blah

313
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,015
Every minute of every day across the world

314
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,087
That that's why memorable names are more valuable

315
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:47,487
You know when you dry pasta a billboard or you see a van which is go to sign written no domain name on the side

316
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Side of it

317
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,631
Think yourself how much easier it is to remember if it's a short meaningful specific name

318
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,215
Then along a convoluted Wanda by the time you gone by you can't remember

319
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,287
So this is the happy vision for the future of the internet

320
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,103
Cleaner more spacious better organize plays

321
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,711
And I could see it happening I could see 10 years from now looking back and saying

322
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,759
Remember when everything was. Com

323
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,783
I was so weird

324
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,367
Shimmer says all this new real estate he thinks it's going to be a good thing

325
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
But there are people out there who think more real estate isn't better

326
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,047
Remember there are a lot of people a lot of companies doing just fine with their. Com

327
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
And for them

328
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,375
All of this new territory can be a threat

329
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
Another thing they have to worry about

330
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,007
If your Toys R Us and you just spent $5000000 on toys.com

331
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
Now you look around and you see theirs

332
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
Toys. Cool toys

333
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,639
Kid help toys. Toys

334
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
What are you do try to buy them all

335
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:43,295
Thomas bracky saw this anxiety first and he's an intellectual property attorney who did some work with

336
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Organization called

337
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Lipo

338
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
The world in

339
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Show property

340
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
Young that with a lot of lawyers for big cup

341
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,023
All of the folks I was there with were brand people general counsel's for brands

342
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
They actually thought it was the worst

343
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Because I already spent

344
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:03,775
You don't deal with the dollars patrolling in policing., protecting their brand the idea that the internet was going to expand

345
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
It was an ass

346
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
They had I can Representatives come and speak

347
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,175
To the folks at life Ellen I thought

348
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
The symbol

349
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
Lawyer for going to throw fruit

350
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
I mean they they hated the idea

351
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,623
Part of the reason they got freaked out is that we had some

352
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Experience with this

353
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,487
Background mm we added about a dozen new top-level domains

354
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Including. Biz

355
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
And things did not go well

356
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
Ben Edelman is a professor at Harvard

357
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
He looked at what happened to. Biz

358
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Its first year

359
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
He said the people who bought a website sending and up is

360
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
Didn't really do much

361
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
That is ended up being a home for speculators

362
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,943
People buying up property to prevent their competition from getting it

363
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
It look like

364
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,783
Half of the domains in diabetes that have been sold

365
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
We're actually demanded it been sold to

366
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
People who wanted to make sure no one else claims them

367
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,999
And then of the remaining half most of them weren't in you seen as a ratio of. Biz domains

368
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
They were actually being used

369
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
2.

370
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Biz domains that work

371
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Either being held

372
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,935
For future use or being held to prevent other people to use them

373
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,495
But something like 1 to 10 1 to 20

374
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:11,615
Unsavory ratio look like most of the people were buying this not because they wanted it

375
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
Because they needed to make sure that they were protect

376
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
The hope is that this time things will be

377
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,527
There are new Protections in place for

378
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
For trademark

379
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Brand names

380
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
Not so it's 10 years later

381
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
Through a lot more people on

382
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,463
So maybe people are finally dying to bust out of

383
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
Of course it's hard to predict what's going to happen today

384
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
These new demands

385
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:35,423
It's always possible you've got a nice piece of real estate and still nobody wants to move there

386
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
When us settlers headed west

387
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
People picked out land that is still just

388
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Tumbleweeds

389
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
Then of course there's Phoenix Arizona

390
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
Lots of people want to live there

391
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,711
Tom bracky the intellectual property lawyer who

392
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479

399
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Is it going to go away

400
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
It's it's

401
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
It's it's full it's crowded but it's also very vital

402
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423

00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191

00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
The Wild West

405
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,055
And we hope eventually people will will build on them

406
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
It's still early days in the Wild West

407
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,199
Adrian McAdory says it's been a very slow start for. Wed

408
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991

416
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
They seem to be attracting new settlers at

417
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
When websites on. Guru became available

418
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
