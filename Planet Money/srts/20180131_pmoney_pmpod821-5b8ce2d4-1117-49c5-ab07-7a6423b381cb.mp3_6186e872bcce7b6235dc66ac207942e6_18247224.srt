18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,560
You can be online to the bathroom and

19
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,096
Need a former ambassador

20
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,376
And if you just look at

21
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,680
The titles of the panel's it's a pretty

22
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,520
High-minded seeing all that cooperation making the world a better place

23
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,336
I went to a panel called the weaponization of culture

24
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,640
With that Swedish Minister and Yo-Yo Ma

25
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,712
It was another panel called we need to talk about privilege

26

I can get a ticket to that

27
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,040
But there is a whole other

28
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
Because

29
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,392
When deseos billionaire some diplomats

30
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,416

00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,000
And down to there

44
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,880
A lot of people who told us that they've come specifically to the lunches to eat the food

45
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,208
So it's being also a soft power kind of swords

46
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,768
Okay so they come for the food but they learn about the Ambassador

47
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,584
Since it's mutually beneficial in both ways down

48
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352

India do they have more rights

68
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712

If you want to go cheap you go for India because you're going to pay twice more

70
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112

I go to the Indonesian Pavilion for some chicken soup and talk about Jakarta startups

75
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,632
And by this point I realize two things about that

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
First

77
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
You never have to pay for

78
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
Second

00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,056
Steam at least in the billionaire bubble is about saving the world

80
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,360

Countries wooing investors by picking their favorites.

83
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,784
Then something odd have

84
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,112
I walk into the spot that Saudi Arabia is rented out

85
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:12,000

There's Cardamom Coffee being served in the corner at jumbo TV screen with

00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
All of Saudi Arabia's number 1

89
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,544
Registering properties in Saudi Arabia is extremely

90
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,152
Affordables actually 0-coast that attracts a lot of investment number one in that

91
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,248
Number one in access to electricity exactly under 1 and tax payments

92
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,016
Exactly

93
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
But then

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
This funny thing

95
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,880

Residence

189
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
Citizens

190
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,415
This is something that is phenomenal and historical

191
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,487
Of course other countries do have a way to gauge their side effects

192
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
National dex

193
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
It's called an election

194
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Perfect of course but

195
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,143
At least it is one way we have the voters

196
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
Can rate the job the governor

197
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Do it

198
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Saudi Arabia

199
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Is not a democracy

200
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
It's World by

201
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
1 royal family

202
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
They're accountable to no one but themselves

203
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,895
And so they designed it

204
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,783
Launching an app that allows any citizen or investor to to immediately on the spot

205
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
Did the government service that they received

206
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
And the feedback comes immediately to our reporting cycle goes right to the cockpit

207
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,999
Address to the cockpit and also goes to the ministers themselves

208
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,375
The Crown Prince who hired a song for this job he's got big plans to diversify the economy

209
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
Make it less dependent on oil

210
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,543
And to pay for these schemes he plans to float an IPO in the largest oil company in the world

211
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
Sessoms former employer

212
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Aramco

213
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
For the first time

214
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Foreign investor

215
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
Stores will be able to buy stock

216
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
In a company

217
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,575
That means that Saudi Arabia has gone from being a country that didn't have to care what people

218
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,159
Suddenly seeking favor with lots of foreign investor

219
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Foreign country

220
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,255
Saudi Arabia is open where open for business

221
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
We're open for Partnerships

222
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
We're open for learning

223
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
And we cannot embark on our transformation

224
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,471
Without being truly humble and interested to learn from others

225
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
Which brings us to why Saudi Arabia

226
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
I showed up

227
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,359
At Davos why they've rented out this Pentatonix

228
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,663
Presented this data to the globally

229
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,735
What song says is that he's going to be meeting with

230
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
Business tycoon

231
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
Global leaders

232
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,599
To basically ask everyone the same

233
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,903
Recognize the people in Dallas

234
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
Tell us how we can

235
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,767
Read this data diferencia light indicators.

236
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
Took off today's

237
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,119
Complex problems in the globe with all

238
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,167
Of these indicators and rankings out there

239
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
What should Saudi Arabia focus on

240
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
What is

241
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Actually the most relevant

242
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Tamil question

243
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,871
I would like it to be more clear about what relevant

244
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
Let's find out

245
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
They said goodbye. Song

246
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,527
Made plans with him to check back in at the end of the conference

247
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
The Friday find out what he's learned

248
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,927
And as I walk back out of the sliding glass doors onto the slushy sidewalks

249
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,279
I was struck by the odd predicament that sound Arabia and really

250
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
Lots of country singer

251
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Need to find this out

252
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
We're on the one hand

253
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
Countries ranking

254
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Candy

255
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
Really important

256
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
In terms of investment

257
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:50,079
Disney Corporation for example reportedly uses one index from the World Bank

258
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
World governance

259
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Index

260
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
To help it decide which countries to put its factories

261
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
But those same countries

262
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,551
They can have very little say on what gets ranked or

263
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
How

264
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,439
I started talking about this with folks I was meeting on the Promenade

265
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
If your a devil

266
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
Over here I just heard

267
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Is the

268
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
That's how I met Sandra Rodriguez

269
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,959
She's a sociologist and a fellow at MIT who's actually been thinking a lot about this

270
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,263
This very question who's making the calls

271
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Because

272
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,103
Ranging also means who gets to choose

273
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
What are you ranking

274
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,663
What's the best

275
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
What are you looking for to rank

276
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
Who has

277
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
Person who has

278
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,111
Central Rivers actually the year she started thinking a lot about

279
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,903
It was 2006

280
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,767
She's going back and forth to Cameroon in West Africa from her home in Canada

281
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,583
Are laws in Canada made of that are cell phones were kind of

282
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
Crappy but not only that they were

283
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
Very expensive

284
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,751
And you would arrive in in Cameroon and suddenly you would have

285
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,823
LED under an umbrella with

286
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,407
7 cellphones and people would just pay $0.25 to use them

287
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
And it was really impressed by the use of cell phones

288
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Think about this

289
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
This was

290
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
12 years ago

291
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,807
Before smartphone

292
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Cell phones

293
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
They're pretty expensive

294
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,159
And yet the poorest cameroonian

295
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
Could rent

296
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,719
The phone for a moment to

297
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Make a call or send a message

298
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,583
But I do know that the big debate was the ranking

299
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,911
Because suddenly you and ranking decided that for

300
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,447
Country to be digitally

301
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Advanced

302
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,543
It didn't mean anymore to have access to

303
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
Digital technology but own it

304
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,663
Cassandra wasn't quite sure why these rankings changed

305
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
Weather maybe the cell phone companies were involved

306
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
But she says what happened next

307
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
African countries

308
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Behind the rankings

309
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
To back down

310
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,159
Africa loses again

311
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
You know North American countries win

312
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Tattoo School

313
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,583
Some people are happy of course most of the rest of the world

314
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,423
This kind of politics can make it into even the dryer sound

315
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
Prince's take the world things

316
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
Ease of doing business index

317
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
2 years ago the country Chile

318
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
Dropped hard in those rank

319
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
Leggings for round 35 in the world to run 50

320
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
85

321
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
And then this month

322
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
The chief Economist at the World Bank Paul Romer

323
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
Revealed that this slide downward wasn't

324
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
Because Chile suddenly became harder place to do

325
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Do business

326
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
It was at the World Bank

327
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Had tweaked

328
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
The methodology in a way that punish chili

329
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
And it punished it

330
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Right after

331
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,143
The country elected as socialist

332
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,215
This was such a scandal that Paul Romer

333
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
Futon the whistle on this

334
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,823
Ended up resigning 6 days later that just goes to show

335
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
How hard it is to

336
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
Understand who

337
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
Race

338
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,735
In the first place the indexes that will be looked at

339
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
Do you think

340
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
One of them is

341
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Here at devils

342
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:45,439
They're probably a lot of them here if you're looking for the Illuminati that's something else

343
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,767
If I couldn't find the Illuminati at least

344
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
Define some member of the indicator Elite

345
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
It will must be here at Devil's right

346
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
Except that turned out to be not

347
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,471
Easy to do I called the World Bank

348
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
Their senior staff were all booked up with meetings

349
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Same thing with the UN

350
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
I almost gave up and then

351
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
I heard about

352
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
A professor

353
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
Pitch Perfect dabo's resume

354
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
She's a Rhodes scholarship

355
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
Advise the IMF

356
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Herewith

357
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
The world economic forum and

358
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
15 dogs

359
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
Professor ngaire woods

360
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
Agreed to give me a little bit of time

361
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
Should and found a quiet corner and

362
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
I told her about this Quest

363
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
They had

364
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751
To meet someone who makes the indicators

365
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
Are you them

366
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
No but

367
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
I know that that's not true I mean

368
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
I have been put into

369
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Indicated

370
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,271
In fact she is in the middle of designing an important new indicator

371
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,039
Right now

372
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
What would a government

373
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,927
Effectiveness indicator look like the government Effectiveness indicator she's doing it with Oxford

374
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
She also consulted other things like

375
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
The UN human development index

376
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
Which have been involved with in the past

377
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
Social Progress Index

378
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,399
So so glad I choose some of my mission

379
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,519
And why you think that all this work fine-tuning the ranking of countries

380
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,615
It would make her more of a believer in the power of data

381
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
It's actually done the opposite

382
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,223
She is a total indicator skeptic

383
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
Countries by here at Davos to be

384
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,647
Tell me about that list you know I'm going to come top or I'm going to move up to point then

385
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
That shows that when I was minister of the economy I really did great things

386
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
But actually

387
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,119
Them reaching that indicated might just mean that they pass the law

388
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,263
It might not mean that the law is being implemented or that it's being enforced Reddit actually changing anything on the ground

389
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
Talking to Mary

390
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
I suddenly got this sinking feeling

391
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Here I was

392
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:44,479
Up here on the mountain finally face-to-face with a member of the Davos Elite

393
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,551
Indicator maker or advisor whatever end

394
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Well down there

395
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,879
In the rest of the world with countries

396
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Cities were

397
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
Killing themselves to be first in the rankings

398
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
The rankings

399
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
She apparently doesn't trust

400
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Then

401
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,351
The person I've met who helps measure the world

402
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Healthiest

403
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,703
Is actually not about the measurement of these not about the measurable

404
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,543
At this point we were talking about how the United Nations has set all these

405
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
Ambitious goals

406
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
The Year 2030

407
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Gold Spike

408
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
End Hunger in

409
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
In Copper

410
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
Now if they'd just on that everybody would have said it's all tyranny

411
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:23,135
So now they've done a deeper exercise of saying he will all the different things we should measure under each one

412
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
To measure progress to woodston

413
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,743
For the next decade or more till

414
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
The year 2030

415
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:34,399
Countries will be arguing about who ranks better in ending poverty in ending hunger and yeah

416
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
Those numbers will definitely be fudged

417
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,495
And they'll probably have politics in them

418
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
But she says that without the numbers without

419
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
Some kind of scorecard

420
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,895
It's hard to get us to collaborate on anything

421
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
So

422
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
Even if these rankings don't

423
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
Actually tell us a real score

424
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
They may at least

425
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
Encourage us to play the same

426
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
After the break

427
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
I bring that message

428
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Search for the mountain

429
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Down to the Promenade

430
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:06,399
Support for this podcast in the following message come from Madewell where the motto is good days start with

431
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Straight jeans

432
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,959
How did they make them so great

433
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
Madewell starts with premium denim

434
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,591
Then offers men's and women's styles for seriously everyone

435

Also you can recycle any brand of jeans in a Madewell store

436
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
And they'll give you $20 off a new pair

437
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,039
They work with the blue jeans go green program

438

Return old jeans

439
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,623
Housing insulation for communities in need

Stop by a Madewell store or go to madewell.com

443
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
Friday morning

444
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
The final day of the conference

445
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
I came back down to the Promenade

446
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,471
Talk with someone from Saudi Arabia in storefront

447
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
I got to say

448
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
I was kind of nervous to

449
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Tell him what I learned on the mountain

450
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,711
Because remember he and his team it's been all this time putting together an iPad app that

451
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:57,087
All these hundreds of indicators and exactly where every country ranked

452
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
He come to Davos to present this thing

453
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
And what I've heard from them

454
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
People on the mountain with the

455
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,279
They don't take these rankings all that seriously

456
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
It turned out that his son

457
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
I've been hearing that line all week

458
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Spot on

459
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,471
And I'm very overwhelmed by this feedback

460
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,031
What indicates Northwest been hitting this as

461
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,383
They taste good indicators of fine but the discussions we can have

462
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
But when you say spot on

463
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
I'm so surprised that you say that

464
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,783
Because I thought you would take note to say that science

465
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,319
Data is data just

466
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
Established

467
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
The Daytona always have

468
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Some bias is right

469
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
After all his meetings at Davos

470
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
One thing has I want to do is take this

471
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
IPad app

472
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,839
With all its thousands of graphs

473
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
Charts and rankings of countries

474
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
And add a comment

475
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
So you could actually

476
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Criticize

477
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
What's the rank of the number you've been given

478
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Literally turning

479
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
The number

480
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
The score

481
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
Into the beginning of a conversation

482
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,455
And that's a lot more messy

483
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
Ben

484
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:56,991
Is first version

485
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
About Clean Vines

486
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
But maybe

487
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
It's more the way the world

488
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:09,535
