00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
The other day I caught this guy Steve Dion

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,328
She lives out

3
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,096
In Las Vegas

4
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,888
Three decades he worth

5
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,168
At a professional game

6
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,264
And I was trying to get him to explain a few things to me about sports

7
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,568
But we had to completely stop the in

8
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,616
Hey can you do me a favor

9
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,920

10
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688

Angel cop

12
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,504
Ski fumble around for a second

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,784
Then put me on speakerphone

14
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,416
I am as as he I'm not a cop I'm a journalist with National Public Radio

15
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,232
I'm very complex

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
It wasn't just

17
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
Paranoid

18
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,072
That made Steve's wife think I might be

19
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
A cop

20
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
A few years back

21
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,192
Police were listening into a lot of Steve's phone calls

22
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:45,824
Including one in which he arranged for a guy to meet him in a parking lot of the Palms Casino in Las Vegas

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,104
With a bag

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
Filled with money

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
How much money are we talking about

26
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,736
It was either 150 or 200000

27
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,504
In cash

28
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
Ncash

29
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,368
She got in trouble for that one he was arrested he spent a few nights in jail

30
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,648
And Steve says

31
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
It was all a big misunderstanding

32
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,720
Make that money

33
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,512
Wichita a loan from a friend of his

34
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
Completely legal

35
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
People act like

36
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,888
This is some kind of a nefarious transaction

37
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
Because people are meeting

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
Stack the money in it

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Parking lot

40
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
But the nature of

41
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544

47
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
Reddit differ

48
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
They say

49
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:30,112
That bag of cash was not just your run-of-the-mill casino parking lot hand off

50
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,928
But evidence of an international conspiracy

51
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232
Involving not only a few gamblers

52
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,536

But it is basically illegal to bet on Sports anywhere in the country outside the stadium in

63
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:01,600
Gamblers though do not always care so much about the law they just want to get their best down

64
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
Casinos in Las Vegas figure this out years ago

65
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
Couple years back

66
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
Wall Street figured it out to

68
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,352

The story starts with a Wall Street guy named Ali-A Medias

95
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136

We left a bunch of voicemails for a meet us but he didn't call us back

106
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
I mean just got a job as a horse trainer

107
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,088
But eventually gave up on the ponies and went to work on Wall Street at a firm called cancer fits

108
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,696
Entry level as a clerk in the back office

Cantor Fitzgerald has been around since the 1940s

117
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,016
They've always been a really big player in the bond

118
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,880
In about 10 years ago a media started thinking about how to take the lessons

119
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,928
Keep learned buying and selling bonds

120
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
And apply them to other businesses

121
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000

Agent by technology

124
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,239
What are you saying there is if you're selling Bond you only going to make it

125
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
I need percentage on each sale

126
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,591
So the idea is to sell a lot of bonds

127
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,687
I mean is finally found another business that follows the same model

128
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,991
It kind of went back to his days of

129
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
The horse track in Brooklyn

130
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063

That was to get a technology up and running in case

156
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,743
Gambling lobbyists ever convinced Congress

157
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,047
To legalize gambling outside of Nevada

158
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,351
Because right now that's the only place it's

159
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
Only in Nevada

160
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,959

00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
Million dollar basket

191
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
All with Cam

192
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,679
Here is the problem with taking a million-dollar bet

193
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,031
If you don't find a million dollars worth of bets on the other side of the game

194
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
You the Sportsbook are essentially just

195
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
Betting against Floyd Mayweather

196
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:17,247
And you might be tempted to start looking outside Las Vegas to find somebody to take the other side of the

197
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,343
It turned out the solution to cancerous problems Within

198
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
New Jersey

199
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
To explain why New Jersey we brought in former NYPD detective jerrard McNally he's been retired for a couple of years

200
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
He still speaks

201
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Perfect cop

202
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
It was

203
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
Something

204
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,983
Going on with an individual that was in trouble

205
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
New proper nouns here no names no place

206
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,639
Did individual not give away any information you might have to give

207
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,759
Show in 2011 McNally was busy investigating a couple of local bookie

208
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
One of our first targets

209
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Shower

210
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,391
Guy out of Jersey

211
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
We had information that he was operating illegally

212
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Sportsbook

213
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Again reminder if

214
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
If you are not

215
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
In Nevada

216
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
Running a Sportsbook is against

217
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,703
Alright so McNally got a couple wiretap up

218
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
Any tell me

219
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
Actually following them around

220
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
We learn a lot about them

221
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Rosetta learn

222
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
Their daily routines

223
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,223
They're actually activities what they do and stuff like that yeah sure we learned a whole live

224
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,039
And while they're learning about their whole life

225
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:28,671
McNally and his team start to figure out that they are onto something much bigger than they first thought

226
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
We tracked the guy from Jersey

227
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,511
Almeda New York

228
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,095
And we're when we have our guys watching this

229
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
I can't believe this guy's walking down the middle Manhattan

230
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,727
And he see the bag you can see the Buddy On Top of the Bay

231
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,311
Like his bag was so full it was overflowing with my

232
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,479
Does Casey's Waukee right in the middle of the Manhattan

233
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
Over the course of his investigation in

234
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
2011 and 2012

235
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
Detective McNally's team attract a lot of guys

236
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
That's what a lot of saxophone

237
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
Do this bath net worth

238
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
Someone would get paid off

239
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
And the next day someone else will get paid off

240
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,399
In Las Vegas or money would appear in offshore betting accounts

241
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Curacao

242
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
Hundred thousand

243
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Millions of dollars

244
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:19,871
McNally says the trail of dollar bills led to this boring little Office Park in New Jersey

245
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,687
Where a man named odoo kyrollos

246
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:27,039
Whose friends called him Spanky was running a very sophisticated wedding operation

247
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Through group

248
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
Of employees and Associates that police started

249
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
Call the Jersey Boys

250
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,463
Spanky place bets worth millions of.

251
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
Not just with local bookie

252
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,559
But with Shady offshore bookmakers

253
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
And

254
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Las Vegas casinos

255
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,191
He was a guy that got up early in the morning was always thinking about the numbers

256
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
You just did like a normal person get up that was his job

257
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Spanky was an investor

258
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
Emathguy

259
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,895
But instead of trying to figure out whether Apple was going to hit it

260
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
Quarterly earnings Target

261
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
He was trying to figure out if the Chargers could win one on the road

262
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,551
I think he was just trying to make money for himself and

263
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,647
And he had a knack for the numbers and he was using it to his advantage

264
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,975
Spanky was always looking for more places he

265
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
You could get that

266
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,791
Which was hard because

267
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,583
The lock has the right to Legal

268
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,935
It was not legal for Spanky to be bedding with the offshore bookmakers and it's

269
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
Certainly was not legal for him to be placing bets

270
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
In Las Vegas from his office

271
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,687
New Jersey but remember Cantor gaming and how desperate they were to find people who could help balance out some of their big bets

272
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:32,319
Cantor gaming they had an individual their time who was an executive that

273
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,415
Was friendly with the Jersey Boys and he would let them operate within the

274
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,511
Casino basically Spanky had some guys on the ground in Las Vegas

275
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Call up and have place bets

276
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,655
No Kenner gaming was not supposed to be taking out-of-state bets

277
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
But the Jersey Boys were one of his biggest customers

278
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,567
Cantor wanted to keep them happy so they wouldn't take their business to the next

279
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Casino down the road

280
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,431
Stihl quick reminder it is illegal for a Nevada Sportsbook

281
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
To take bets from out

282
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Outside the state of Nevada

283
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,063
And there's another little rule that

284
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Cantor

285
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Is breaking here

286
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
When there is a big payouts

287
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,183
Casino has to report it

288
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,511
Booty keep Spanky and the Jersey Boys happy

289
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
Canter was not filing a lot of these

290
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
Reports

291
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
Detective McNally says Cantor actually came to dip

292
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
And on the

293
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
They knew who the Jersey

294
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
Boys War because they needed their help

295
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,079
What they needed was for the Jersey Boys 2

296
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
To do something called

297
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Buy-Back

298
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Sometimes

299
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,967
Cancer would take too many bets on one side of a game

300
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
So they'd have

301
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
$200,000 on the Chargers winning

302
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,111
And not nearly as much on the Chargers lose

303
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,415
So they call it spanking New Jersey

304
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:46,047
Mhal would you be willing to put down 20 or 30 or 50 Grand on the other

305
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Other side

306
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,631
And a lot of the time Spanky would say GIF sure

307
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
No part of this was

308
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,959
He wanted to keep things friendly with

309
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:58,079
Thank you that was not just doing this to be nice remember he's a math guy and so

310
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
Just really quickly this roughly is what he's

311
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Spanky is betting

312
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,015
With the Vegas sports books but he's also betting with words books in the Caribbean

313
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
The Vegas sports book

314
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
They might have the Chargers winning by

315
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Three points

316
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Wow the Caribbean Sportsbook

317
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
They might have the Chargers winning by 7

318
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,535
So Spanky bats in one place for the Chargers

319
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Win

320
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
And then the other place for the Chargers to lose

321
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
Most the time those better going to cancel

322
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
Search other out no harm no foul

323
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,775
But sometimes the game is going to finish with the Chargers winning by four points

324
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Five Points

325
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
R6 points

326
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
Spanky is going to win

327
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Both bats

328
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,783
The technical term for this is meddling and it's a way for Spanky to make a lot of money without really take

329
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Peking mushrooms

330
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
Now there's a part of me that wants

331
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
To say

332
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
What is the big deal with of

333
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
I know are we supposed to be outraged

334
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,303
Spanky's taking advantage of a bunch of books like if you leave out the facts

335
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,911
There's not that much difference between what he is doing and what a stock Trader or Bond Trader

336
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Raiders doing all day

337
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,519
But detective McNally's his gambling is like a Gateway crime

338
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,079
It leads into all of these much bigger crime

339
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
The backbone to other crimes

340
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,199
Now you talkin I owe you money now what you got to do now you got

341
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Extortion now you got loans out

342
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,111
They may not do what they did like in the old days where people were disappearing or whatever

343
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,207
But it is back on of organized crime has always been gambling and always will be

344
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
It makes a lot of money

345
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:25,631
McNally brought an organizational chart with him like you know when the cop shows that got the bulletin board with all the red string connect

346
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Different criminals

347
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
This one for the Jersey

348
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,007
So am I look on this list and under some of these people

349
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Those names

350
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,127
It will say Gambino associate or Genovese associate

351
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
I assume those are

352
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Crime family

353
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,783
Some of these banana guys are kind of a little scary look

354
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
We're not saying they're the muffs

355
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,231
But there's like on the fringes of them like the margins but even Spanky the math guy

356
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,047
Detective McNally says he started to go down this road

357
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,375
There was an individual that hold a large amount of money to him

358
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
Jen with the individual

359
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,215
It wasn't like spank you could go to the

360
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
The police for help

361
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
And on the wiretap

362
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,359
McNally could hear Spanky calling up a guy connected to the Mob

363
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
Spanky wanted to send in some muscle

364
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
To try to get his money

365
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
I think he was actually asking for

366
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
Permission to hire someone else to do it

367
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,903
But that's a heavy thing to do to someone to say I'm going to get someone to go after

368
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
So

369
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,279
To me at that point I knew he wasn't Mister innocent anymore

370
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
After a couple years

371
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
Wiretap in

372
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Telling people

373
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
Detective McNally and prosecutors

374
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
We're finally ready

375
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Cheat to move

376
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,079
In New York and New Jersey and California and Las Vegas Police rolled out in force

377
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,895
And then one day they arrested 25 people and

378
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
Do you eat a lot of sacks

379
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
Filled with money

380
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,247
Along with Spanky the bookmaker

381
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
From cancer the mob guys

382
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
They also arrested

383
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
Steve diano

384
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:53,951
The Gambler I talk to at the beginning of the show the guy who got the bag full of cash in the Palms parking lot

385
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,535
The cop said that bag full of cash that way

386
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Was part of the Jersey Boys operation

387
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Well they

388
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
Banging on my door

389
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
The clock in the morning

390
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
We had a

391
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
A big dog

392
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
My wife

393
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,287
Let me put them in the backyard

394
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,199
Steve got taken to jail and thrown in a Cell for a few days until he could find someone to post is

395
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,015
I had a friend of mine in Philadelphia

396
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,087
Get a cashier's check for the amount of money

397
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
And stick somebody on a plane with it

398
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
And flight out

399
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
The Vegas at night

400
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
But that was

401
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
Not a fun couple of days

402
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
I had

403
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Set my fan

404
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
Tennessee football lineup

405
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,127
That's the real the real downside to being thrown in the clink is not being able to set up your fantasy football team

406
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
Kicker was on a bye that we got us

407
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
How to make

408
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Some kind of arrest

409
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Even worse for Steve

410
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,831
The police seized over $300,000

411
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Seth his money

412
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,183
She insists that money was just a loan from a friend

413
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,023
The cops ain't none of them and it was tied up with the Jersey Boys gambling

414
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,143
Steve arrange the sit down to the DA Prosecuting his case to try to clear all this up

415
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,727
And he asked him what the Steve seemed like the central question in his

416
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
Is there any law that would

417
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Would prohibit me

418
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
Borrowing money

419
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Large sum of money

420
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
Depositing it into a sports betting account

421
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
And setting my

422
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
Moth office

423
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,623
And he said no there's nothing illegal about that

424
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,439
Still the DEA was not willing to back

425
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,047
And rather than risk going to jail for 25 years Steve eventually pleaded guilty

426
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
26 degree conspiracy

427
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:41,471
Conspiracy basically means you know a crime is going to be committed and you're in on it

428
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,287
6 degree conspiracy is the least serious form

429
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
What is

430
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,615
Exactly that crime was in this case

431
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
Little harder to pin down

432
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
I had to Alex

433
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Cute to having

434
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Committed

435
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Some crime

436
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
Unspecified

437
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Defied

438
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,343
During the course of their investigation

439
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
Which to my recollection

440
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
I want

441
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Speed limit

442
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
The real punishment for Steve

443
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,023
He never got his $300,000

444
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
And because of that

445
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
She is no longer a professional gambler

446
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
He can't afford it

447
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
Now

448
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,727
Because they took my money for no reason

449
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
I'm an Uber driver

450
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:20,639
Spanky the chief Jersey Boy ended up pleading to a felony charge of

451
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
Promoting gambling

452
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,479
He forfeited almost $700,000

453
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
State government

454
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
For his part detective McNally is happy

455
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Happy with how it all worked

456
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:33,183
Still he acknowledges it stamping out illegal gambling is a pretty impossible

457
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
Do we change nearby I don't know

458
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
I don't know

459
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
Money does weird things

460
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,399
Spanky my Colbert the bookmaker from Cancer and Leo

461
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
All the client,

462
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:48,031
So did CG technology that's the new name for Cantor gaming

463
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,103
Let September they settled with Federal prosecutors

464
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,175
They agreed to pay fines of more than 22 million dollars

465
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,271
They fired their Chief bookmaker and an August Leah meatus resigned is

466
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
CEO

467
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:03,903
Also they mostly don't take those giant bats anymore the ones that cut their books so out of whack

468
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
All Wall Street wanted

469
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
It was for the rest of the world to be more like Wall Street

470
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,839
To have sports betting work the same way that buying a bond

471
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,167
Money should be able to go where I can make the most profit

472
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,983
Whether you're betting on a treasury bond or the San Diego Chargers

473
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,567
CVS but much of the rest of society doesn't see it this way

474
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,359
And they keep writing off

475
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,687
What's some good news for the Wall Street dreamers

476
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:32,831
In 2015 the Nevada legislature passed a new law making it legal for gambling and vest

477
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
To set up shop in the state

478
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:39,231
If you live in New York or New Jersey or anywhere else in the United States

479
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,071
Now you can buy into one of these funds and let someone else Campbell on your behalf

480
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,655
These funds will probably not satisfy someone likes

481
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
Because investors can't

482
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,751
Choose what games to bet on or weather

483
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
The Chargers

484
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Falcons

485
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,591
The fund manager makes all the

486
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
Which seems like it takes all the fun out of gambling

487
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:04,063
But still it is now illegal for a guy New Jersey to allow someone else to gamble for him in Las Vegas

488
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,415
There's only one sports book company currently taking bets from these funds

489
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,719
That company is CG technology

490
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:29,151
Any of you know something happening in Vegas that shouldn't stay in Vegas

491
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
And should be a Planet Money show

I'm Keith Romer

501
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
Did that guy just want a weekend

502
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,095
What seems like my mama mama but these guys are like

503
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,423
What did you make any assumption that people are going to hear Italian names

504
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,727
Like Gambino and he says these are prime fam

505
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,287
Is it okay I'm going to ask

506
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,079
You is at the mafia and then you can explain

507
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,639
I'm not going to make an assumption

508
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
Half Italian

509
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
Noel King full disclosure

510
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,527
Is a part of the mob or the fringes of them

511
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
Will you please put that in my mother

512
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
