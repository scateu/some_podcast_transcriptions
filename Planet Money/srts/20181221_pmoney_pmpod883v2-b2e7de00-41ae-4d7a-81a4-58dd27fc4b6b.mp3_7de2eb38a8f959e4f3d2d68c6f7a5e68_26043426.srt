Investor.gov

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,064
Can you hear us yes hello hey we're up and running Catherine eckel runs a behavioral economics program it

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,928
Texas A&M University where she studies the many reasons people donate money

12
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
So

13
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
Suppose that you

14
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,560
Really like Planet money but Along Comes somebody who says

15
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840
I'll just pay for planet

16
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,424
Can someone who only cares that planet money exists

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,216
Would reduce their giving

18
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,312
Does Planet Money doesn't need it as much anymore that's a rational thing to do at that point

19
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,128
But part of the motive for giving seems to be

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
I don't just care that Planet Money exist

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,760
People want to be the one who's doing the support

22
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,808
Okay and that's the Warm Glow

23
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,344
The Warm Glow

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,440
As in like how I feel like an actual thing they're getting

25
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
From giving

26
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,512
Actual utility

27
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
Okay

28
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,584
I'm going to I'm going to make like a little commercial

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
I'll just

30
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,752
Reminding people that warm glow exists they could have a piece of it to try it

31
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,056
What that feels like

32
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,872
A beating heart

33
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640

Connecticut

45
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
To watch a play

46
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,480
An adaptation of Charles Dickens

47
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
Christmas

48
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
I want to say

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
First things first

50
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
They treat you right in Brandon

00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,416
The play's director of met me at the school door

Scalloped potatoes

Green beans

Side salad

58
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,192
Before things got started I sat down with the star of the

59
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,520
My name is Adam Jackson and I am playing Ebenezer Scrooge

60
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
Scrooge

61
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
Is literature's most famous mice

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,640
And the plot of A Christmas Carol

63
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,944
Is basically these three ghosts

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Spirit of Christmas Past

65
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Spirit of Christmas present

66
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,808
Spirit of Christmas Yet to Come

67
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,880
Convincing Scrooge to be a better person

68
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
He starts off

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,256
And you have to play him completely meaning completely rude and completely evil sort of

70
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,328
But then by the end of the show he's everyone's best friend

71
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:48,192
About an hour after our interview the entire cast got together in the school's choir

72
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
Baba baba baba Sali I can see in your eyes that you recognize

73
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,640
I did High School theater

74
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,712
That is the sound of four dozen teenagers

75
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
Warming up their vocal cords before a show

76
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,392
Mi Mo mu alright repeat after me

77
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Can I be

78
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,768
Adam and all the other kids are standing in the big circle buzzing with

79
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
Pre-show jitters

80
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Everyone's wearing their butt

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
Frock coats and vest and old timey dresses

82
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
Boys tryouts

83
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,752
Country girls wearing top hats with their hair in ponytails

84
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
Play the boy parts

85
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
After the warm ups

86
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
The place director

87
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,176
The slight silver-haired retired teacher named Maria ogren

88
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Is the Nook tablet

89
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Last night

90
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
You proved

91
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,064
That you could do this today

92
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,856
And tonight

93
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
You're going to prove that last night

94
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
Was not an accident

95
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
Okay

96
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
You'll melt look

97
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
Part of my reason

98
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Traveling all the way

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
From New York to Branford

100
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,984
It's just that I have this tremendous soft spot

101
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
For the earnestness of high school

102
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,336
Quiet quiet quiet

103
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Close your eyes

104
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
Set her down

105
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
All right

106
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
We Are One

107
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
Have a great show

108
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:11,392
But there was another reason I was there the play they were doing that

109
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
A Christmas

110
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,256
It is so much more than just a story

111
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,351
About whether the Ghost of Christmas Past can convince Ebenezer Scrooge

112
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
To be a

113
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
Decent human being

114
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:28,799
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Keith Romer and I'm Sally helm

Carol

117
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:39,295
Yes the story is about saving time Tunes life and teaching screwed to the true meaning of Christmas

118
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
But it turns out

119
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,671
Charles Dickens is up to weigh more than just telling a ghost story with a happy in

120
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
A Christmas Carol

121
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
Is this knock-down-drag-out fight

125
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,943
People often think annuities are too conservative

126
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
Too complex or only for retirees

127
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
But annuity

128
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,575
These can be a smart way to hedge Market

129

Creepy CGI Jim Carrey version

143

Here's where we start

144
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
It is 19th century London

145
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,183
The Industrial Revolution is in full swing

146
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
And we need to start of our story

147
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Ebenezer Scrooge

148
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
Oh yes

149
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
Mystic

150
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
Have you come to make payments on your new

A contract is a contract

I would have my payment when it is due

158
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,759
Scrooge is somebody who has gotten very very rich

159
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,063
Presumably from the industrial

160
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
Ocean itself somehow

161
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
But he is not about

162
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
Least of all

163
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Poor

Everyone

175
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,455
On Christmas Eve Scrooge gets visited by a series of ghost

176
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
I'm the ghost of

177
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Christmas pop

178
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
I am the ghost

179
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Christmas present

180
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Are you

181
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,159
The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come

182
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,463
The ghost show him all these fish

183
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
Including one work

184
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
Tiny Tim dies

185
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,631
Presumably because Scrooge doesn't pay Bob Cratchit in

186
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
Divisions work

187
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
The ghost convince Scrooge to

188
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Stop being a miser

189
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
In fact Scrooge become super generous

190
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
Give Bob Cratchit a raise

191
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
Titan lifts

192
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
A Christmas Carol

193
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,711
Is one of the iconic holidays.

194
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,551
It's basic message that we should all be nicer to the poor

195
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
It's part of how we think about Christmas

196
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Itself now

197
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
But

198
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,439
When you sit down to read a Christmas

199
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Miss Carol

200
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,839
You are actually diving right into the center of this massive argument that has

201
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
So little to do with Christmas

202
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
And so much to do

203
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
With economic

204
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
Surprised

205
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,335
In 1843 when it Christmas Carol was written

206
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
The big economic question was

207
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199
What the hell is going on with this Industrial Revolution

208
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
Where is all this money coming

209
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Why

210
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,343
Are there all these poor people leaving the countryside and coming to the cities

211
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
Is all of this change even a good thing

212
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,999
The decade of the 1840s in England

213
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
That was increasing

214
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Mass

215
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:07,423
Poverty that's Michael Slater he wrote a biography of Charles Dickens title

216
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Charles Dickens

217
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
Wages

218
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:16,127
What kept very very low in England and it was kind of rule capitalism if you like

219
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
Slater says

220
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
The inspiration for Christmas

221
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
Miss Carol Dickens red

222
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
Parliamentary report

223
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,807
About the terrible working conditions of

224
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Poor children

225
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
We're talkin 8 year olds working

226
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,183
14 hour days in Coal Mines I just

227
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,023
Everybody be clear the position of NPR is that that is bad

228
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
And so

229
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Was Charles dick

230
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,655
Dickens was horrified by

231
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,959
What he read yeah but

232
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
Charles Dickens

233
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,311
He's not just some random tender-hearted dude

234
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
He is a super

235
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
Famous

236
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Tenderhearted

237
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,271
Back at the time that we're in 1843 there is no TV

238
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,391
What is instead yes

239
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
Correct

240
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,719
When Dickens go to America in 80

241
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
1842

242
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,815
Thousands of people turned out to see him in every city

243
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,119
He is a huge deal

244
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
So

245
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,935
Super Famous Charles Dickens decide

246
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,727
He is going to use his Fame

247
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,751
To take a stand

248
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,823
And so he decided he would write a pamphlet

249
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
A cold in a few

250
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,687
On behalf of the poor man's child

251
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
To be fair that was a thing back then

252
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Tablets

253
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
And for a while

254
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,343
Dickens is pretty fired up about his pamphlet

255
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,903
But then he remembers

256
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
No wait

257
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
Charles Dickens

258
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
You're in the freaking pamphlet

259
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,559
He had the very sudden inspiration

260
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
How to write a short book

261
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
In the form of

262
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
Almost like a kind of fairy story

263
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,567
And he said this would have him at his house and times more effect than any articles

264
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
But he could ride

265
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Would you go sit there

266
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Dickens write to a friend

267
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,967
Says his new story is going to

268
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:01,855
To hit with the force of a sledgehammer and you want to know what he is going to smash

269
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
With a sledgehammer

270
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
This new academic discipline called

271
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Political economy

272
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
Balloon alcoholic

273
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,863
These political Economist they wanted to do for social sciences

274
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
What Isaac Newton had done for physics

275
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,495
But instead of discovering the laws that govern motion and

276
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Forest

277
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
They wanted to discover the laws

278
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
That governs how human beings

279
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Charles Dickens

280
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,223
Not a fan you just hated

281
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
Questions to do with Humanity being

282
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Dealt with in a

283
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Episode of

284
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,183
Coldly scientific mathematical sort of way

285
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,767
He was all for the heart rather than the head does it work

286
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,583
Okay so Dickens captain of

287
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
The heart team

288
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,679
Captain of the coldly scientific head team

289
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Adam Smith

290
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
Adam father of economics

291
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
That's the one in 1776

292
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,127
He publishes his 900 something page book

293
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,455
An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth

294
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Of Nations

295
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,855
They should be buddies Charles Dickens love creating 900-page books

296
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
Bleak House

297
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,719
Dorit depending on what you get David Copperfield

298
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
A mutual friend

299
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
I looked at it

300
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
Okay so there are a lot of ideas in the wealth of May

301
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
But for most readers

302
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
The big takeaway

303
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,983
Self-interest is

304
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,311
If everyone just looks out for themselves

305
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
Then the Invisible Hand of the market

306
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
Is going to do an amazing job

307
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
Of allocating capital and labor

308
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,783
And the economy is going to grow and it was going to be better

309
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
People are going crazy for

310
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Fitness idea for Adams

311
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
Efficiency and self-interest

312
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
They're going to save us all

313
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,767
When you read A Christmas Carol you can almost hear Dickens muttering to himself is

314
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Rights

315
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:50,143
Yeah take that exchange that we listened to before between

316
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
Scrooge and

317
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Warminster Pembroke

318
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,103
This scene in the play doesn't actually occur in dickens's original but it is definitely true to the book's description of sky

319
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
Screwed as a quote

320
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Merciless

321
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
Teresa

322
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
We will need more time

323
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
No

324
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Set

325
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
A contract is a contract

326
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
I would have my payment 22

327
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,439
It's pretty hard to be more self-interested than Ebenezer Scrooge

328
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Picture of

329
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Business

330
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Is business

331
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Good day

332
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,423
Charles dickens's version of Adam Smith is

333
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
Such a jerk Adam Smith though

334
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
She is just the tip of the iceberg for

335
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
There's another scene

336
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
This one straight from the book

337
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
Where to people come by

338
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
Asking for donations

339
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
For a Christmas charity

340
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:42,623
We are raising a fun to buy the poison food and warmth that this time of year to be surprised to learn that Ebenezer Scrooge

341
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
Will not be donating this Christmas

342
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
But if you listen carefully

343
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,743
To the way he says no

344
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
You will hear Dickens taking shots

345
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
At a second

346
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Bleckley County

347
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Mai Tai

348
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
What about the prison

349
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Who's in the workhouses

350
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:01,055
Those that badly off my stove

351
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Forgot to die

352
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
In 1843

353
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
If you heard that last phrase

354
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
Surplus population

355
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
You would 100% no

356
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
Food Charleston

357
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Was talking about

358
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,023
Is that terrible phrase about the Surplus population

359
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
That's a reference

360
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,631
To the Reverend Moses and mail

361
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Tea

362
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
H u s

363
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,519
Okay nurullah podcasting that I'm making up for this show

364
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
When one scholar

365
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,127
Literally spells the name of a historical figure

366
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,687
You have to find another scholar to

367
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Explain that historical figure

368
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Sally Helm

369
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
I accept your terms

370
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,183
I'm broke Mayhew I am a professor of historical geography and intellectual history at the University of Bristol in

371
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,279
Indian ice kingdom Mayhew wrote a book about the Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus

372
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:59,679
Titled Malthus Malthus was a pioneering glitter Economist his main work

373
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:05,311
Walls a book Gold an essay on the principle of population which was published in 1798

374
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,199
He's most famous for arguing the population will inevitably outstrip

375
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,063
The results is it needs to survive on that folder that will be some form

376
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Oh

377
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:23,487
Population collapse or crisis in our ability to sustain ourselves is a civilization said he's known as a

378
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Prophets of Doom Isis

379
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
Malthus was not a big believer

380
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
In the possibility of economic

381
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,655
What he saw

382
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
When he looked at the history of the world

383
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
Was not progress

384
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
But instead this endless back and forth

385
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Good Times

386
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
And bad.

387
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
In Good Times

388
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,967
Everybody would be like life is great I'm going to have a giant family

389
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
And then the bad guy

390
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
Wages would go down

391
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
Food prices would go up

392
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
And poor people would start

393
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
And now this

394
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
Quite understandably

395
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,255
Thought that this was terrible

396
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
But

397
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,863
He also thought that in economic terms

398
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,679
The root of the problem was that there were just too many

399
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
People

400
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
People who starved

401
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
They were the

402
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Surplus

403
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Population

404
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,895
Here's Michael Slater again

405
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:18,783
Being a romantic also loved most of his grades

406
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
Part of this is Dickens

407
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,415
Deep suspicion that in their quest to understand how markets work

408
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Political Economist like mouth is

409
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,511
Had completely lost sight of the fact

410
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
That these were people

411
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
Not just numb

412
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
But because his real problem with Malthus wasn't

413
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
Like the form of his thinking

414
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
It was the Practical conclusion

415
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
That mouth is came to because of that thing

416
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,639
Conclusions about what Society should actually do

417
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
About the pool

418
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Mai Tai

419
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
Just about the prisons and the White House

420
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
Those that badly off my stove

421
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,135
In 1843 there were a lot of people who were badly off

422
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
The Industrial Revolution was

423
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Kind of economic

424
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,047
But it was not a miracle that everybody shared in

425
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,095
And if you were really poor

426
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,167
And you couldn't find work there was pretty much just one option

427
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,703
The workhouse

428
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Workhouses had always been pretty horrible

429
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
Families would get broken up

430
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,151
Mint 1 Section women to another children to another

431
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,455
Everyone would get some terrible job

432
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
Breaking rocks or literally picking apart

433
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
Rope in individual strands

434
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
Exchange

435
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
You would be fat

436
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
You wouldn't starve

437
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
But earlier in the 1800's there started to be this concerned that some of the people trying to get poor relief from

438
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
The government

439
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
Could have found other ways.

440
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
To keep from starving if they really wanted to

441
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,447
So in 1834

442
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
Parliament passed what are called

443
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,775
The new poor law

444
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:48,383
The ancient SE full Polo is designed to make it work harnesses

445
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Much less

446
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,991
I can type track to that's not the right word but to

447
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
More frightening as it were

448
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
And

449
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:00,159
One of the most famous proponents of these new harsher workhouses was

450
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
U guessed it

451
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Thomas Malthus

452
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,047
There is this even darker Jabet mouth

453
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
Hidden in the Christmas

454
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
Amor Direct

455
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
About not caring enough about the children of the poor

456
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
In one of the visions that the Ghost of Christmas present shows.

457
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,615
Scrooge sees his clerk Bob Cratchit at home

458
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
Prepare ourselves

459
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,711
Finest Christmas dinner in all of London

460
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,271
May the Lord make us truly thankful

461
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,087
Gratiot is this wonderfully loving dad

462
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:34,975
But he is also a kind of stand in all the people who are being left behind by the industrial

463
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,559
While the scrooges of the world are getting rich

464
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,399
Bob Cratchit is taking home at very little in wages

465
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,727
And because he's so poor his son Tiny Tim

466
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Tights

467
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
In a second vision

468
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Scrooge watches

469
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Bob

470
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:54,431
Gathered his family around Tiny Tim's unused little crutch

471
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
And tell them to never forget their

472
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,575
But when we remember how patient

473
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,415
Tell Michael he was even though he was a little child

474
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
We shall not easily quarrel among ourselves

475
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
What you doing so

476
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
Bob Cratchit is a good dude

477
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
But he's poor

478
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:20,031
And he has a big family is Tiny Tim apart of the Surplus population

479
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,895
I assume the tickets is main point

480
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Is

481
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
The

482
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
In a cold

483
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:32,319
Utilitarian calculus Tiny Tim is Surplus population

484
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,135
At this point in the Bible cast I will blame

485
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
Basically no one

486
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,487
Who feels like they would much rather be on team Dickens

487
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Venti mouth

488
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,559
Am I sensing

489
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
Are you on team melfes

490
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
I mean what

491
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,359
Is so Malthus is the scapegoat for a bunch of riders

492
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
Including maybe Dickens

493
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Who never even read it

494
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,479
Strawman okay but part of it

495
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,807
Is that Malthus is this kind of tragic intellectual figure

496
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
Because he was kind of right

497
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,183
But he was just about to be totally wrong

498
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
Sally

499
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,231
I brought you a girl

500
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
My favorite oh my God

501
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
It's quite a graph

502
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
Okay it is

503
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,447
World GDP over the last two Millennia from the Year One

504
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
Bay City prison

505
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,567
Strong timeframe GDP gross domestic product

506
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
Basically every bushel of wheat

507
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,199
House every Christmas wreath that got made each year

508
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
4 mm

509
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,575
And it's basically flat flat flat and then at a certain point in

510
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
What we say

511
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,207
Old 1798 or so

512
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
It shoots up

513
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
World GDP just goes

514
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Crazy

515
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,863
Goes into a base without a vertical line from them

516
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,447
Super almost 2000 years GDP growth is like

517
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,495
.3% is basically

518
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,079
Hasn't been invented yet malthus's right but then

519
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
The Industrial Revolution

520
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
Then he's wrong basically

521
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
The day he publishes

522
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
The economy shoots up

523
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
All of a sudden there's

524
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
Not just

525
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,135
Is plenty of food there's plenty of everything

526
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,463
This is that super steep growing part of the graph

527
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
Steam power factories

528
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Mechanization

529
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,607
The economy the British economy especially takes off

530
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:24,703
Basically in the 45 years between mouth is putting on his book and 7th

531
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,031
98 n tickets publishing A Christmas Carol in 1843

532
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,127
No. Growth didn't get shared by everyone there were still

533
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Plenty of Fish

534
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
But

535
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,783
Human beings show they could figure out how to grow the economy

536
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,135
The population could grow and there would still be enough food for everyone to eat

537
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,951
So basically history proved Malthus

538
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Totally wrong

539
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
I just want to point out

540
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,095
History also kind of proves Dickens Rock

541
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,959
I'm for almost the exact same reason as what happened to Malthus Malthus misses the possibility that

542
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
Economic growth

543
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
Because economic growth has never happened

544
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,103
But Dickens completely misses this second

545
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
Huge economic shift

546
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431
That is happening right under his feet

547
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,527
A shift by the way that political Economist like Adam Smith

548
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,831
Said was going to happen and then does

549
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,367
Right around 1843

550
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Wage growth

551
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,768
Is weird growth of a sort

552
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
In

553
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,608
I have a sword Christmas.

554
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,704
Do the little number on screws into a different person

555
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,264
No no no no good.

556
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:36,128
I will honor Christmas in my heart and

557
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,432
New Leon miserly Ebenezer Scrooge

558
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,224
Give Bob Cratchit a raise

559
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:44,064
Wage growth a Merry Christmas Bob my good fellow

560
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,368
I told raise your salary

561
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
With your struggling family

562
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
Makeup app

563
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
It is not

564
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Just

565
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,400
Scuttles of coal

566
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
Tiny Tim lives

567
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:04,288
Surplus population problem solved by the miracle of the Christmas spirit

568
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
Okay

569
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
I'm about to be dispersed

570
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Go there

571
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:12,480
I know that the point of A Christmas Carol is that everyone should be kind and generous to the poor

572
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
Adobe clear

573
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
I am for that

574
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
But the secret to wage growth

575
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
Canopy

576
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:24,512
Ghost visiting Employers in the middle of the night and convincing them to be more generous

577
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
What happened

578
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:31,168
Right around the time that Dickens write a Christmas carol all of that Industrial Revolution wealth that the Bob cratchit's of the world weren't

579
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,496
Seeing any of it started sort of seeing some of it

580
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
And that was for tons and tons of

581
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,824
Productivity went up

582
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,616
More and more of those Factory owners had to

583
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
To compete for workers

584
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
Labor organizing help

585
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:49,856
We just started this long long rides that lifted a lot of Bob cratchit's of the world out of

586
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,392
Now look

587
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,696
Charles Dickens want his readers

588
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
To use their hair

589
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Consider

590
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,536
Bob Cratchit and Tiny

591
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
Tim

592
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,608
Is real living breathing human being

593
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,400
Not as data points on a graph

594
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,960
Care about making their lives by

595
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Okay

596
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,288
Political economist

597
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
Then and now

598
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
What's a

599
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,152
Look making that graph

600
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,736
Using numbers to describe the world as accurately as hell

601
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Possible

602
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,576
Sometimes that is a necessary first step

603
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,368
Making people's lives better

604
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
There is something about those grass

605
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
That just does not sit right

606
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
I asked Ben Klaus who plays Bob Cratchit

607
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,352
Why he thinks Tiny Tim end up surviving

608
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Second question

609
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
Construed

610
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
Save the day musically

611
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
And

612
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,360
Tiny Tim is the result of that he's alive he's well

613
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
He's doing okay

614
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,456
If I made the argument

615
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
That would really save Tiny Tim

616
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,368
Was the increasing productivity of the Industrial Revolution would you just say that I'm kind of a scrooge

617
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,184
Probably are

618
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,328

People often think of nobodies are too conservative

624

Too complex or only for retirees

625
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
But annuities

626
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,928
These can be a smart way to hedge Market

627

Is it Thomas is it Robert is a pastor what do I call

674
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,304
Is William Thomas Robert that he's known by his own family as robot

What About Bob

678
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:51,520
Occasionally unless he's bought but II as a rub it myself I didn't think so

679
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
Because you don't want to be called Bob he said he felt the most of most of the contemporary

680
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:04,832
Artist to him all to Toma Sol to rub it and if you know him a protocol in communicating about him

681
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
With him is probably Thomas

682
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,392
I really want to call Bob
