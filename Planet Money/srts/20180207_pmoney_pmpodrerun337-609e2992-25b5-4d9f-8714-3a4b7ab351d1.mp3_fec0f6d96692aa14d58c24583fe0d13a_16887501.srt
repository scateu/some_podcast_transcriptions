00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,816
Hey it's Jacob Goldstein just a quick note

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,352
Today Show first aired

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:07,680
6 years ago after David kestenbaum and I went to China

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:08,960
Hey

5
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,496
Tiny little planet

6
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
Money that's right hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm David kestenbaum

00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,920
I'm Jacob.

8
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,736
Today on the show The Story of a secret document

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:24,064
Meeting in a small village and hidden in the roof of a mud

10
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,160
The people who signed this document were afraid it might get them exit

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,440
Instead

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,512
It warmed up completely transforming China's economy

13
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:39,424
Support for this podcast in the following message come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

Is children more information is available at aecf. Org

16
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:55,296
Before we get to the story of the secret document that transformed China

17
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,856
Let's just get a feel for where China is today

18
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
Let's start out on a train

19
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Ladies and gentlemen this is not just any train this is part of China's new bullet train

20
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
Network the largest in the world like Safari

21
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
Contrave

22
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
Can you start to move faster actually I read up at top speed

23
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
130 km an hour

24
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
3840 / 300 km/h

25
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
Miles an hour

26
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
Makes Amtrak look primitive

27
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,056
Bullet train stations here there are these huge gleaming things

28
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Pek Airport

29
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:55,712
What's really striking about this whole picture is just how far China has come in just a few deck

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,784
Happens in 1978 a year when

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
Most Americans have cars

32
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
Garages I was

33
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
9 years old

34
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,440
Sitting on the couch watching Welcome Back Kotter on tell

35
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,048
Betsy Muir David millions of people in China didn't even have electric

36
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
And you could argue that this transformation

37
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,704
This change that took China from mud Huts to bullet trains

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
Started in a single small village in world

39
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,592
The village is called zhougong and we went there

40
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,480
Very nice to meet you thank you for talking to us

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,952
This is yuanchao and by the way none of the people we talked to and Jog on spoke English so

42
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
We're hearing here is a Transit

43
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,328
Genji until he's one of the people who started China on this

44
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
Path of bullet

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
And one of the really fun things about reporting on China's economy

46
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,336
Is well so if you're in the US and you want to talk to one of the founding fathers of the US economy you want to talk to

47
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,176
Alexander Hamilton he's been dead for hundreds of years

48
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,248
But in China a lot of these key people they're still around

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
Engine Chow is not an economist

50
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
He's not a politician

51
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,880
Rent a small restaurant in jalgaon

52
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
30 years ago when all this happened

53
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
There's a farm

54
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,608
Engine Chow open metal gate behind the restaurant

55
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
He takes out to the field where he used to farm

56
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
Back in 1978

57
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,008
Everyone here worked on a collective Farm

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,592
Ricky Canton ropings in winter

59
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
I say that

60
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,480
Oh my God I just died and it was still basically the height of communism

61
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,064
And on our visit this Village we actually spent a long time

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,648
Just trying to figure out how the system worked on a communist Farm

63
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,208
The basic idea was that people would work together

64
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
For the common good

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
And in this world as tianjin Chow explains it

66
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,096
Nobody owns anything

67
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
Do you know me gif

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
I used oxygen to form but they weren't mine

69
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
They belong to the group

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,104
I couldn't belong to the group

71
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,408
Individual student anything

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
At 1 meeting with Communist Party officials

73
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
When farmer ask

74
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,064
What about the teeth in my head do I own those

75
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
NOAA.

76
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Your teeth

77
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
How long do they collect

78
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,208
Everything in this world with centrally planned

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,583
The farmers were told what to plant by a Communist Party official from outside the Village Inn

80
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,703
Sometimes they were told to grow rice even if they didn't have enough water to properly grow rice

81
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
Indian Child says back in this era

82
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,335
Every morning a whistle would blow to Mark the start of the work day

83
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
It would have to blow it twice

84
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,223
The farmers would drag themselves out of their huts and go to work on the fields

85
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,551
At the end of the day and everyone would stop

86
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
You get points for working all day

87
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,975
But it didn't matter how much or how hard you work you just had to show up

88
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,071
Even if you had decided to go out early and pull weeds or something

89
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
It wouldn't make a difference

90
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,471
Everyone gets the same

91
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,287
So people don't want to work

92
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,359
And after the Harvest the government collects what everyone is grown

93
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,151
And give the village and allotment of food

94
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,199
In the case of Zell Kong

95
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
Allotment was never enough

96
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
So they were hungry all the

97
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
Their kids never had enough to eat and

98
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
Jensen Chow in the others young farmers

99
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
They had to walk to other Villages and beg for food

100
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Xiaomi

101
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
We will follow

102
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Who is supposed to produce

103
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Tobacco food

104
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Was not honored

105
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,471
Nintendo switch

106
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
Which house is Vera Sheen

107
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
It was hard to not come to us in the back for food

108
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
What you say

109
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,479
This is the way things were all over China this is basically the way the entire economy

110
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Farmers in jalgaon

111
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
We're starving

112
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
And they needed to do something

113
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
One farmer in particular was pushing for a change

114
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
His name

115
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
Ian Hunter

116
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:55,327
We tried to onion hunting as well and we talked to him in this open garage attached to his house

117
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,191
There were sacks of grain piled up along the wall he smokes cigarettes the whole time

118
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
It was just really cold rainy day

119
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,031
And he told us that

120
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
Out of desperation

121
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
The farmers

122
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Came up with an i

123
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,175
But the idea they had was so dangerous

124
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
They had to call a secret meeting to discuss

125
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
Concerts

126
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,111
It was about 5 in the afternoon

127
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
This was a secret meeting

128
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
Doja cat

129
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
We snuck in one by one

130
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,911
There were eighteen Farmers crowded into the small room

131
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Dungeon chalice

132
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
Were there were there

133
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Enough chairs for all of you

134
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
How could there be chairs

135
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
Some of us

136
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Close

137
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Sunset on the floor

138
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
What's up

139
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
Little tiny stools

140
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
We have no chairs back then

141
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,487
Germantown says everybody there was afraid to talk so finally he spoke

142
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815
Tarzana Unified

143
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,375
Everyone is here and knows what

144
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
This is about

145
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007
I know wanted to speak

146
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
Just woke up

147
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
What Argentina

148
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,407
Watch Awkward

149
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
I said we're all here

150
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
Because we have to find a way

151
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
To save ourselves

152
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,879
To save themselves they have an idea that is both revolutionary

153
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
And as old as dirt

154
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
Rather than Farm as a collective

155
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
Each family gets to farm

156
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
Its own plot of land

157
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
And the family grows a lot of food

158
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
That family gets to keep some of that

159
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
You own what you

160
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:40,799
But owning and communist China in 1978 that's something like

161
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Treason

162
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
I was scared

163
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,967
Does the Polynesian scared you wouldn't be able to do it

164
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
And that wouldn't work

165
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:55,135
So in this little dirt floor groom by the light of a broken-down oil lamp

166
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,927
Farmers are talking about this idea

167
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:02,815
Stop the older farmers who remember the days before communism when they could find their own land they said

168
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
We have to try this

169
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
But a lot of the guys in the room

170
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
They were really scared

171
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
Hello

172
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
Yes we want to do it

173
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
I don't think this will work

174
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,247
This is like high voltage wire

175
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
Farmers have never seen electricity

176
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
They had heard about

177
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
You would die

178
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
But they decide they have to do this

179
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
The alternative is to

180
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
Shunyi beijing

181
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
I'm going hungry

182
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
They decide they need to write this down

183
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Write down a contract

184
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
Laying out how this is going to work

185
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
Put their names on it so they're all bound to

186
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
So no one can go back on

187
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
There's only one problem

188
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,663
Paper just plain paper is hard to come by in jalgaon in 1978

189
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,735
Yen Ching tell us he's going to write on a cigarette

190
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
But it turns out this other farmer had some paper

191
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
So he runs together

192
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
And then

193
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,903
Yin hun Chun rice this historic thing

194
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,207

00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023

Enrolling myself

206
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,719
I remember

207
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
Can you tell it to us

208
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Bummer

209
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,583
Gandalf

210
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,607
Chattanooga weather

Each family will give a share of the crops and the collective at the end of the year

214
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,759
Who are put in prison or executed

215
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
We will not complain

216
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
And the others in a group

217
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,159
Well raised our children to 18 years old

218
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
There in a sentence

219
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
The first capitalists of modern China

220
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
Their livelihood is in their own hands

221
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,839
If it works

222
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Don't have enough to

223
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
If they get discovered

224
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
They could be killed

225
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
But one by one

226
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
The farmers come forward to sign on to the car

227
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
They realize they need to hide this thing

228
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
And eventually

229
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,711
Ventana winds up sleeping it inside a piece of bamboo in the roof of his house

230
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,807
Engine shout remembers the first day he went out to Farm after they sign

231
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
I just felt different

232
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
Basilica

233
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
I felt

234
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
I feel comfortable you my heart

235
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Energize

236
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,583
I show off my abilities

237
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
Did you work harder than before

238
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
The summertime Comedia

239
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
Of course I work hard

240
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
Will do

241
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
Because whatever I produced was mine

242
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
If you didn't work hard

243
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
Nut cookie origin

244
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,063
And we all secretly compete

245
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
Everyone wants you to produce more than the next person

246
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Pat

247
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
Got people watching hot

248
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:16,863
It's amazing to think this is the same land they have the same tools it's the same farmers

249
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,959
But just by changing the economic rules just by saying

250
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,519
You get to keep some of what you grow

251
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Everything Changes

252
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
What y'all doing

253
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,151
We started work before the sun came up

254
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
And we would interior Woodstock

255
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
This working all the time thing

256
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
Actually get them into trouble

257
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,135
Engine House of the neighbors noticed it and they started to suspect something funny was go

258
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,975
Why were these crazy Farmers going out to work before the whistle blew

259
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Before Dawn

260
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
Why were they working so late

261
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,119
And at Harvest time there was an even bigger problem

262
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
It was impossible to hide

263
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,215
They had an enormous Harvest

264
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
It was more food according to gun hunt Chong

265
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
Then they had grown in the previous five years combined

266
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
It was both exciting and Turf

267
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,015
One day young sean gets a call from some local party officials

268
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
They some of them to their offices

269
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
When you get there he says they swear at him

270
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
And they treat him like he's on death row

271
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
They said they're going to lock him up

272
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,767
Fortunately for Jensen Chong at this moment in history

273
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,839
There is this really broad debate going on in China

274
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:25,215
They're powerful people within the party who are saying we need to try some economic experiments

275
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,031
In fact the regional party Chief in this area

276
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
She was one of these

277
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,151
Pro-reform guys and he had visited yet hun Chun and it said to him

278
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,223
What you're doing here it looks interesting you should keep at it

279
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
So when yin and yang get called in

280
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
He begs for permission to make one

281
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
He gets it and he calls the regional party to

282
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
The guy who been supportive

283
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
And luckily for him the official answers the phone

284
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,559
But the local official next again hun Chun

285
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Grab the phone away from

286
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,423
Hoverboard

287
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,959
I could still hear what

288
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
Regional party Chief was saying

289
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
He said

290
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
Do not change anything

291
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,407
I approved

292
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
This experiment

293
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,271
Challenger blow him to continue working on the phone

294
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
So they let young chango

295
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,671
He goes back to the village and keeps farming and this experiment it keeps working

296
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
Eventually word what's happening in Saigon

297
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,327
Mix it up the chain of command through the Communist party to the very top

298
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,143
The Deng Xiaoping the guy basically running China

299
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,959
Danielle Kang is one of the pro-reform guy

300
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,079
At this moment he is poised to become the key reformer who creates China's modern Econo

301
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,919
Think nothing has been wanting to change the way farming Works in China

302
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
Any lights what's happening as y'all gone but

303
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
This is still communist China

304
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
It's just 2 years after the death of Mao

305
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,879
And lots of people are opposed to what's going on in jail

306
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,463
So then can't say anything bad about Mao or Collective farming

307
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
Things big picture idea is

308
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,119
Let's not worry about whether something is capitalist or communist or socialist

309
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
Let's worry about whether it works

310
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
There's this

311
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:04,287
Famous quote that's attributed to dang that they would we actually heard all the time when we are in China

312
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,639
It doesn't matter if a cat is white or black as long as it catches mice

313
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
It's a good cat

314
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,759
Things up and doesn't stand up in public and give these jogging Farmers metals

315
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
He's quieter about

316
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
He decides to have these two writers tell the story

317
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
He calls them in and says

318
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
I support this

319
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,207
You guys should go tell the jog story to the rest of China

320
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,559
And pretty soon people all over China are farming like the people in jalgaon

321
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
Farmers on what they grow

322
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,679
The government starts trying out other economic experiments

323
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
Factory spring up in cities along the coast

324
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
China lets foreign companies

325
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
Coca-Cola open the plants in Beijing

326
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,871
And China's economy grows like

327
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,503
And this crazy economic growth has gone on and on for more than 30 years now

328
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,319
Who's the farmers in jail gang sign that contract

329
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:52,415
Something like 500 million people in China have risen out of poverty

330
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,743
They moved from mud huts with dirt floors and oil lamps 2

331
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
Houses with electricity

332
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,375
They moved into a world of cities and high-rises and New Roads and bullet train

333
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,471
People all over China know that one sentence version of visual Kong story

334
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,567
If you're driving by the town on the highway this little sign by the highway exit

335
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Is a small Museum in

336
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,383
Telling the story of the contract

337
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:17,247
And it is this incredible true story that marks the beginning of China's economic rise

338
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,831
But when you look at what has happened to Jug on since then

339
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Things get complicated

340
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:29,535
I get especially complicated when it comes to you and hung Chong the guy who should be a hero of modern China

341
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,095
The guy who was the first one to speak at the meeting who

342
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,911
Actually wrote the contract and heated in his roof

343
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,799
But on our first day in town when we asked the local Communist Party officials if we could talk to Yong Jun Chong

344
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
They told us he was out of town

345
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
But we went back to jogging the next day

346
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
And we found Ian Hunter

347
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
Which is why you're hurt him in the story

348
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
We asked if he had been out of

349
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
Were you here yesterday

350
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Bonanza

351
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
I was here yesterday

352
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
We were told you were not here yesterday

353
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
Photography

354
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
I was here yesterday

355
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,375
When you asked about what happened in that Hut in 1978

356
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
Everybody agrees everybody tells the same story

357
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,775
But when you ask about what has happened in sell guns since then

358
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,359
Devin Chong in the party officials they tell two very different

359
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
The official version is that everything in town is

360
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,247
New factories are springing up there lots of jobs

361
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
Shelgon is living happily ever after

362
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,623
Nanchang says he's had a different experience

363
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:31,487
He says he started a few businesses over the years but once they became profitable the government

364
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
Took them away from him

365
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,839
