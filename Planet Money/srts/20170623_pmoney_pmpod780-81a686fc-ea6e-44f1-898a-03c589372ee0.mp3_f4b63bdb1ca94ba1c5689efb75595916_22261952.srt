1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,560
If you think one thing

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,096
And then at some later moment youth

3
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:04,864
I think something

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,168
If another words you change your mind sure you

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,448
You become farmer

6
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:11,520
You get called mean names wishy-washy

7
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,312
Flip flopper

8
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,848
In England is apparently

9
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,920
You Turner and in Australia

10
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
Back flipper

11
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:19,968
On the other hand

12
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
And if you do not

13
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,040
People say oh I like

14
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,600
He sticks to his guns I know where he stands

15
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
This is messed up

16
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,696
This is backwards changing your mind

17
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
Is Brave

18
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
You face the world

19
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,280
And you're saying

20
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
I was wrong

21
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,864
Admitted

22
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,168
Changing our minds is what we're supposed

23
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
To do

24
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
Because what are we

25
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
Right all the time about everything

26
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:47,104
No no no we're not right about everything and when we realize we're wrong

27
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
We should change armor

28
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:55,296

32

People help each other change them

First Step Catherine Baker

43
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
To the health economist

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,776
Set Harbor and she told us about something you care about a lot and that is

45
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Hospital Emergency

46
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
Cheap rooms are full of people who won

47
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
Do not have health insurance

48
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
N2

49
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,944
Do not have a medical emergency

50
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
Because

51
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,040
In the emergency room under federal law they have to treat

52
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,576
You even if you don't have insurance

53
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
They can bill you later

54
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,648
But they cannot send you away

55
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
You had insurance and you could afford it you go to the doctor but if you're uninsured the emergency room the only place you can afford to

56
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
This is a problem for for a few reasons

57
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,216
For one thing it makes emergency rooms more crowded in general

58
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
Time for another

59
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,312
It's really inefficient the emergency room is annex

60
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Pensive

61
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
Bad place to get Basic Metal

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
Interferes with Katherine Baker thought

63
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
If you gave people health insurance

64
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
You could solve

65
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,112
This problem they'd be less likely to go to the emergency room when they didn't have a medical emergency

66
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,696
Their health would improve you would spend less money

67
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
Because

68
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,072
Insured people don't go to the emergency room to get their basic care

69
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,424
And by the way over and above the emergency room thing in that back anomic case

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
Just believed in

71
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Expanding health

72
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
So I've

73
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,384
Always held the view that it's a public policy priority

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
To ensure low income people and

75
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Make sure they have it

76
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
The food and housing

77
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
But I know those are my views as

78
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
A voter

79
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
And is a taxpayer

80
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Haha

81
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
That doesn't

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,096
Mean that there scientific evidence to say that's what everyone should think or that's what we ought to do

83
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
A while back

84
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
Baker Ford about this thing happening

85
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
The state decided to expand

86
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
It's health insurance program

87
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
Medicaid

88
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
1000 more

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176
But Baker says there were still way more uninsured

90
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
People then there were available spots

91
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
So Justice

92
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
Fairway

93
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
Hand out those limited spots

94
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Del Lottery

95
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,952
They got a whole bunch of people to sign up on a waiting list

96
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
They drew names by chance

97
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,048
And the people whose names were drawn

98
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
Got a chance to get the public insurance

99
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
And the people whose names were in

100
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Didn't

101
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
The Sims

102
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Kind of

103
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Holder

104
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,264
Cruel somehow but

105
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
You know they had to choose some way to do

106
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
This is the way that you

107
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,664
And crucially for Baker organs decision

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Do it this way

109
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
Create a disc disorder of natural Xperia

110
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
You know you have this big pool

111
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,112
Some of them are randomly selected to get Medicaid

112
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
Some of them are randomly denied

113
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
Baker looked at this in real life

114
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
You followed both groups of people

115
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
And compared what happened to them

116
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
You could learn so much

117
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
That provided

118
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,703
A perfect opportunity to figure out exactly what Medicaid does

119
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,263
The in particular you could actually test

120
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Weather people in fact

121
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Go to the emergency room

122
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
Less after they get mad

123
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,223
So Baker and her colleagues went out to Oregon talk with the people who are getting insurance

124
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
The people that weren't

125
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
But you know what the official

126
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
And then

127
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
They posted their entire study plan in advance

128
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,927
They explain everything they were going to measure and how they were going to measure them

129
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
So that everybody knew they weren't just like waiting until the end

130
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
And cherry-picking it was

131
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
Once I did this it was

132
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
Just a matter of waiting for the results

133
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
And then

134
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
The day arrived

135
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:02,079
Thomas like a movie we joked we should get popcorn and just watched the results and where were you and

136
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,663
Are you with like your co-authors just what where were you in the day.

137
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,783
Life isn't like a movie I was sitting by myself looking at my computer

138
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,599
And I got the results via email

139
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
She clicked open on the email

140
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
You saw the result

141
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,719
People who got health insurance

142
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
Did not

143
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
Go to the emergency room

144
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Less

145
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
In fact

146
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
They went to the emergency room

147
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
More

148
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
40% more

149
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
And people who did not get insured

150
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,263
Her first thought was like maybe they done the math

151
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Made some errors

152
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
The processing it was so surprising

153
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
I had not expected

154
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,175
A result of nearly that mag

155
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
40% increase was really

156
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
Much higher than I had even

157
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
Imagine

158
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
The math was correct

159
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,647
Bottom line Baker says her study showed

160
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
Very clearly that when people get Medicaid

161
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
They get more health

162
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Not only do they go to the emerging

163
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
They go to the regular doctor more as well

164
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,423
Her study found that Medicaid does not save taxpayers

165
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
For science

166
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
It seemed

167
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,055
Like a really interesting important find

168
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
And

169
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,735
Frankly not every paper elicits that reaction I think most of my papers are dull

170
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
Important end

171
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,623
A major scientific contribution and that's exciting

172
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
On the other hand I felt

173
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
Disappointed for the

174
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
Cause

175
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Of expanding health insurance coverage

176
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:33,215
The thing you're discovering as a scientist is bad for the thing that you want as a city

177
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Yes

178
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
And that's

179
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
Really

180
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Hard as a

181
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,711
Person who is both of those people at the same time

182
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
I have to say

183
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,575
This is a thing that I love about

184
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,903
It is it is this whole system of thought

185
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
And action that is designed

186
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
To change people's minds

187
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Sure you

188
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,095
You have some belief about the world some story that you're telling her

189
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
Yourself and that's fine

190
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
Button test

191
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
And if it doesn't hold up

192
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
You change your mind

193
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
You come up with a new story

194
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
And obviously this is an idealized version of Sia

195
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
I know it doesn't always work

196
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,687
That way but sometimes it does write it worked in this case

197
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
Catherine Baker changed her mom

198
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
Here is her revised story

199
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
About what happens when pee

200
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
People get Medicaid

201
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
Wearing my

202
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
Economist hat

203
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
I couldn't really be

204
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
Oh that's

205
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
Surprised which is what made me realize my

206
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
Prior view was more of a

207
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Hope that anything else

208
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,751
Because one of the basic things we know from economics is that when something Cost Less

209
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
People use it more

210
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
Emergency department no exception

211
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,199
It used to be really expensive to go even though they couldn't turn people away

212
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:49,759
They could still issue a Big Bill at the end

213
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,879
And so uninsured people were reluctant to use the emergency department because they couldn't pay for it

214
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,463
Once people get insurance they don't have to pay any more

215
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
So they go to the emergency room more often

216
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,399
The other results of the study were mixed but he did show that there were several ways in which people on Medicaid

217
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
They did seem to be

218
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
They reported being in better

219
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,543
They were less likely to get into financial trouble

220
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,151
And Baker still thinks that giving Medicaid to more people is a good idea

221
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
She thinks it's worth the money

222
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,247
But she says that is her view as a citizen

223
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
Not as assigned

224
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
Okay so just give it to you haven't heard from you or do you know if you have a name

225
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
Memorize I have a memorize but I read them out in order

226
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
As they are

227
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
Okay

228
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
So brulee is

229
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
This is Cowper

230
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
He's 21 years old

231
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
And he's helped to come up with a set of rules

232
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
That has done something miraculous

233
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
Created a place

234
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
On the internet

235
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
Where people can calmly and rationally

236
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
Change other people's money

237
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,295
It's a group that Turnbull founded on Reddit called changemyview

238
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:00,159
He found it about 4 years ago it now has more than 300 thousand members

239
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,023
It has been the subject of multiple academic studies where people are trying to figure out

240
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
I would think like this could actually happen

241
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,375
And internal says the magic for this

242
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,935
The secret sauce is these rule

243
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
Bruce would have taken years to figure out

244
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
And he walked us through

245
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,871
So Brule is explain the reasoning behind your view not just what that view is

246
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Here's a changemyview

247
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
People go there and they post something they believe

248
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Some view that they

249
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
We put some real examples of these

250
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
The minimum wage should be abolished

251
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
Or communism isn't that bad

252
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Or

253
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,975
Voldemort from Harry Potter is actually kind of crappy

254
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
That person Route 6

255
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Paragraphs

256
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
Explaining the reasoning

257
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Behind the Voldemort

258
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
And that the idea behind

259
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Making people

260
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,959
Explain the reason behind their view is

261
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,031
If you want to change people's mind it's not enough to know what they able

262
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
If you have to know why they believe

263
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Okay next

264
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
Ruby

265
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,455
You must personally hold the view and be open to a change in

266
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Turnbull told us that

267
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
He wants change my view to be a destination

268
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
Hope use that they're open to change

269
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,415
But that there may be embarrassed or uncomfortable

270
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
Talking about in real life

271
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,279
Like a couple examples of use people and posted recently

272
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
One of them

273
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
If you date outside your race

274
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
You are a race

275
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
Traitor another one

276
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,263
Christianity Judaism and Islam are all generally

277
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,591
Evil the people who posted those two they both change their views

278
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,639
Direction rules are basically house

279
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
Keeping roof C is about formatting

280
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
Ruby no method post

281
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,039
Other words for through love changemyview

282
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,599
Do not talk about change my view on change my view

283
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
Is a whole other subgroups

284
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,791
He only post if you're willing to have a conversation with those reply to you and are available to start doing so within 3 hour

285
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
Hours of posting

286
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,375
We don't want you to just hit and run with your post

287
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
You're if you're entering a relationship

288
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Yep

289
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,007
And these are committed relationships on some of these posts

290
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,055
People go back and forth and back and forth for like

291
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
5080 pages

292
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Hundreds of comments

293
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
Good next

294
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
Don't give you the hostiles other users

295
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
When you started the subreddit

296
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
Did you have a lot of these kind of

297
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
Personal attacks

298
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,647
Yep

299
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
This rule Usher obvious

300
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
But it's paired with another rule it's a little bit more surprises

301
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,887
This other world says you are not allowed to reply to someone's View

302
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,215
Buy just confirming or validating what they already

303
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,543
People were just coming in and saying yeah I agree with you

304
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,663
No reason to change this view productive

305
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
In these two rules the

306
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
Don't Be a Jerk rule combined with

307
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
You must disagree

308
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
Rule the show just

309
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
How difficult it is what turned

310
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,951
Civil discourse here is on a Razor's Edge

311
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
One side

312
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
The thinking spiral off in

313
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
The fighting

314
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
And then on the other side spirals off into agreeing

315
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
Into like an echo

316
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
All right last rule we're going to talk

317
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,847
Award a Delta if you've acknowledged the change in your view a Delta that the Greek letter that looks like a little triangle

318
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
And is the symbol of change

319
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,967
And this is basically like I change my view merit badge

320
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
And so the waitresses like

321
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,295
Say I show up in post my

322
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
Bob Dylan is underrated

323
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,255
And Kenny than you show up and you you and I say underrated they gave him a damn

324
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
Nobel Prize

325
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
And it's okay fair enough maybe he was appropriately rated

326
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,191
You have changed my view

327
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,007
And now I award you a Delta

328
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
And and what is happened

329
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,383
On the group's introduces is Delta's have become

330
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
This status

331
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
What I find

332
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Really into

333
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,087
About this is I feel like they have flipped upside down the way status Works in this

334
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
Typically

335
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
The way you get status ended

336
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
Is not actually buy a

337
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,791
Appealing to the other side to the people here nominally trying to convince

338
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
What you're really doing is like showing off for your

339
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
So you get status for like

340
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
For like a sick burn or a good comeback Irwin

341
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
But those are not

342
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
What kinds of things actually

343
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
Change other people's mind

344
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
Until what the Deltas have done is

345
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
Transform the way you get status

346
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,967
There is like a leaderboard for the people who get the most deltas

347
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
To change other people's mind so

348
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,783
So in this group

349
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,159
The way you get to be you know a big deal is by really changing other people's money

350
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
And that's it those are the 10 rules

351
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
And taken together they

352
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,559
You really seem to work people come in

353
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
They post their views on things

354
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
Controversial or silly or whatever

355
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,703
And then there is this civil conversation

356
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
On the internet

357
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Without name calling

358
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
And sometimes people change their views

359
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
Did you feel like you come up with rules

360
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,711
You know for for the world not just for your subreddit

361
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:45,087
I mean yeah that's that's why when I look at these I think this is the kind of thing that people should

362
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,183
Should follow when they're trying to persuade other people or just in general conversation

363
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
And having rules

364
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
Some people that sounds a bit like

365
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
Authoritarian or something

366
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
But they're not

367
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
Really rules

368
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
They're kind of advice

369
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:03,519
Because this is what works and this is what doesn't work and that's kind of what we're saying

370
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:10,175
I mean they are rules but your saying there for our own good

371
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
Exactly

372
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:17,343
In a minute we'll have the third and final chapter

373
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:23,743
I think is a lot more interesting than it would sound if I describe it now

Cory doctorow is one of these people

381
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,343
Has like seven different jobs or whatever he writes novels

382
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,647
He's one of the editors of the website boing-boing

383
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,719
And he is one of the biggest names in the fight over

384
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Copyright law

385
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,815
Doctor who thinks that copyright law is

386
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
Is broken that the way it works and I was bad person

387
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
Society

388
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
Bad for people who do

389
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Do creative work

390
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
But

391
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
Doctor did not always feel this way

392
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
And the Ark

393
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
How he changed his mind

394
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
Is really Illuminating and it's a useful way to

395
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
You think about

396
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
The Arc starts

397
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
With doctors

398
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
First Servpro

399
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Professional ID

400
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Is a science fiction

401
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:25,183
I started writing science-fiction when I was a small kid like literally when I was six and I started sending it to magazines when I was

402
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975
16 and selling it when I was 17

403
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
What is first publish stories

404
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
Was called craphound

405
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
It has been an alien who loves

406
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Yard sales

407
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
You know I was a baby writer

408
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,727
I'm so what I knew about copyright was what I learned from other writers

409
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,079
So I thought that copyright was a thing that authors got

410
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
Because they made something new

411
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
With their brains

412
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
And that they had a moral right to it

413
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:54,111
And that by holding onto that moral right they could also make sure that big rapacious companies didn't rip them

414
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,207
He thought copyright should probably extend forever like if you build a house

415
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
You can pass it on to your children

416
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
They can pass it on to their kids

417
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
And so on

418
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,095
Why should it be any different if you write a book

419
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,167
Doctor went off to college became a programmer

420
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
And started a company

421
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
That in some ways grew out of that view of

422
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
Copyright this was the era of Napster

423
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,895
You know that the program that made it super easy to download music for free on the internet

424
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
Any idea behind doctors company was

425
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
Let people download files on the internet

426
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,343
But put rules on Powell and and whether they could share those files

427
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,207
For example you're allowed to listen to this once when you download it from someone over the internet

428
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
But if you want to listen to it again

429
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
You've got to pay some money to unlock it again

430
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
To make this technically pasa

431
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
Dr. Oz company was going to use with

432
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
Call digital rights

433
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
DRM

434
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,775
Basically this is a way to encode these kinds of rules

435
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Into the software

436
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,615
Doctors company raised 19 million dollars

437
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
He starts flying around the world to speak it,

438
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,735
And it was on the road to one of those

439
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
This one was in Hong Kong

440
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
That he had his conversion

441
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
He was traveling with a corporate copyright lawyer

442
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
Who was going to go to the same card

443
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
I sat down and coach

444
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
Doctor Who was on the Isle the lawyer was

445
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Was in the middle seat

446
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
It was in the days in which

447
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:11,167
You know I books were look like toilet seats and had a battery that lasted for 30 minutes

448
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,471
Atlanta laptop for our younger

449
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
Yeah that's right

450
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,335
And so 30-45 minutes in

451
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
We have nothing to do

452
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,967
Airplane food and argue about copyright

453
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
Its 30000

454
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
60 / the Pacific

455
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
The copyright lawyer

456
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
Start in on.

457
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
He says

458
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,647
Your view about copyright is naive

459
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
Overly simplistic in fact

460
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
This whole way of thinking about creative work

461
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
Is wrong

462
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
We don't have copyright because there's some kind of

463
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
Moral right of ownership

464
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
That that people have to their creative

465
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Because

466
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,287
What thing that I did doesn't even make sense

467
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,079
You know the way creative stuff works

468
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,151
Everybody is always taking stuff from everybody else

469
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,199
This is true you know in music

470
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
Rock and roll was basically

471
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,575
The blues and if x equals all the way back everybody has always.

472
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,135
They call brahms's First Beethoven's tenth

473
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,207
That's good that's a lawyer says

474
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,511
Look your stories are full of ideas

475
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,815
You borrowed from other science fiction writers

476
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:15,679
You know all the people who wrote about aliens before you do they have a moral right

477
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Own all stories about aliens

478
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
Indoctro says something like

479
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
Maybe maybe not

480
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,383
So by the time we got off the plane

481
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
1215 hours later however long

482
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
The flight is from San Francisco to Hong Kong

483
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,807
I had serious doubts

484
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,159
And then one around Hong Kong for the next two days and we weren't at the conference going to the

485
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:41,023
Cuz you're all horribly jetlag to so like going to the temple Street Market at 2 in the morning to eat

486
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
You know tentacles

487
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
And shouting about copyright

488
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,887
My dream trip

489
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
The lawyer convinces doctor that copyright is not about some

490
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Moral right to

491
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Pretty it's much more practical

492
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
In fact it's spelled out

493
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
Recently in the US comes

494
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
Institution

495
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,735
The new transform Cory doctorow can quote it off the top of

496
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,855
To promote the useful Arts and Sciences Congress shall create monopolies of limited times right

497
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,903
Soap so not because

498
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,207
You got property rights and everything you make

499
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
Butter promote

500
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
The useful Arts and Sciences

501
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,071
In other words the point of copyright

502
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,631
Used to get people to make more stuff

503
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,703
Because it's good for society when people make stuff

504
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,263
When it right songs and books and make movies

505
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
More

506
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Is better

507
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
And in the end

508
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
I realize that

509
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Copyright

510
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Weather was a policy

511
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
That's created

512
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,551
To encourage certain kinds of creativity

513
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
And that

514
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:42,207
The limits on copyright like how long it lasts or when people can use your work without your permission

515
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Those aren't just

516
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,863
Off to one side of copyright there as important as the exclusive rights that the Creator gay

517
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
Conference ends

518
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
Dr. Agosto

519
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
Before long

520
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
He decides

521
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
What my company is doing

522
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
Using digital Rights Management

523
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
Putting all these copyright rules indica

524
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Computer code

525
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,943
It's not doing what I thought it was doing

526
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,991
It's not really encouraging creative

527
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,807
It's not really helping little artists

528
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
It's mostly helping big cup

529
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,671
And I wrote a letter to the investor

530
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
And told him I was going to work there

531
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
I was quitting

532
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,303
He goes to work for this Foundation that pushes for Less

533
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
Strict copyright

534
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Start arguing publicly

535
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,471
That the details of copyright law serve big corporations were than little artists

536
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
He says copyright protection should be shorter

537
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,079
Is essentially out in public arguing

538
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
The exact opposite of what he believed

539
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,943
This makes him a star among a lot of

540
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,759
Tech nerds but a lot of espousing Science Fiction world

541
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
Much less impressed

542
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
My writing teacher

543
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,719
Once threatened to punch me in the face and a panel about copyright years later and there's another there's another writer who

544
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
I think literally hate

545
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
Over this

546
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,815
And she still one of mine

547
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
It sucks to have people say

548
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,191
That I have done something

549
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
Thuja

550
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
Describe the children of working artists

551
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Of their do

552
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
I think they're wrong though

553
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
One thing is striking to me about doctors

554
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
I feel like

555
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
He changed his mind

556
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,759
In part because
