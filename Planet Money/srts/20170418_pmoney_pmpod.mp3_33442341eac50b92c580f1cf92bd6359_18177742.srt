Cat Wine

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,440
What you described it as decadent

This drive me insane

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,592
Because it feels like we are suddenly swimming in Bizarro holidays

34
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:23,712
Tomorrow is national puppy day is National Pancake Day

35
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,808
Just seems like someone is inventing holidays

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
The try and sell us a bunch of

37
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
And I wanted to get

38
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
To the bottom of this

39
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
So I came up with

40
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,280
I figured if I could unspool the events that landed one of the

41
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,072
Questionable holidays on

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
If I can follow it back to its origin

43
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
And just maybe

44
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
Understand what was

45
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
Powering

00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Holiday music

47
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
And this

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Is why I wound up on the phone with Edge

I do want buffalo wings

90
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Shockingly hard to

91
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
To get someone to talk to me

92
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344

93
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368

Flatout declined

97
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
I got another station

98
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
He told me

99
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
No one is going to talk to you on the record

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,168
This is like real invasion

101
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,472
Felt like I was kicking stuff up

102
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
But then I finally found someone who would talk our guy

103
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Head shop

104
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336

106
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:05,760
I tell you I've never heard of National Splurge Day so it doesn't surprise me like that we did something about it

107
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,064
It has a 5 and a half hour Morning Show today

108
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,160
He's no shame about National Splurge Day ending up on his are

109
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
But he too was curious how it got there

110
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,791
So he pulls up a log that has every segment has station has ever run

111
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
He flips back

112
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
2015

113
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,191
And there it is okay I'm going to click on this National Splurge Day

00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
!

115
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,567
There's a record of who pitched it and it says what does it say there

116
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
This is emailed by a

117

It is

130
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,031
Kat maudru is the first lead in our investigation

131
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:05,407
She's the pr person for Raley's which is a grocery store chain in California and Nevada

132
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Cat told me yeah

133
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
High pitch

134
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,039
National Splurge Day to Fox 40 it was a way to get the grocery store on

135
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
But she can't remember exactly where she got it

136
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,463
She told me that she just Googled food holidays and there are a crazy amount of

137
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:25,119
Do you keep a running list of these holidays I do I have a folder on my computer with the the different holidays

138
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Do you have it in front of you

139
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Maybe

140
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
Could you open it and read me some

141
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Love

142
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:35,871
National garlic month National meatball day even National raisin day

143
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:40,735
I will tell you right now that that is later on this month and I have a take her

144
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,319
And I haven't gotten around to explore going to talk to you about we wait

145
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,207
You already pitched National raisin Day to a media outlet and they said yes without knowing what you would do about it

146
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,279
Yes and I imagine we can maybe do some trail mix

147
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
We could do some baking

148
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,863
We can throw it in salads put it

149
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,935
Okay so National raisin day is not the holiday Warehouse

150
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,055
But it ended up being a very helpful because because after I hung up with

151
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,079
With cat

152
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
We started poking around

153
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:13,247
National raisin day is over a hundred years old an article from 1910

154
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,647
Complaining about how it was Shameless promotion by raisin growers in the Fresno Chamber of Commerce and this is the way some

155
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,951
Strange days are born it's exactly what you would say

156
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Money

157
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
What's corporate interests

158
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
Was maybe a good

159
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
Good PR person

160
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
And sometimes

161
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Even the governor

162
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Thank you mister speaker

163
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,983
In fact United States Congress

164
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Used to be a holiday

165
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,103
Factory all right today to talk about National Golf day

166
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,455
You hear these called commemorative.

167
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,319
At one point, he's got a little out of hand with the passing of made-up holidays

168
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,135
The peak came in 1985 and 86

169
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
This is during the 99th Congress

170
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
During that time

171
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
One in every

172
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Three laws

173
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
Was a commemorative day or week

174
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Or

175
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
That is to say

176
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
Congress passed 606

177
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
54 laws during that session

178
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,495
227 of those

179
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,799
Worst things like National air traffic

180
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Control day

181
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,895
National bowling week and national birds of prey month

182
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,991
Legislators were spending so much time announcing crazy holidays

183
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,319
It finally in 95 the House of Representative said

184
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Enough

185
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
And the pastor rule forbidding the introduction

186
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
We looked

187
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
And during the Congressional holiday Mania

188
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,279
There was no National Splurge

189
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,911
But we also learned that after the holiday Crackdown people still wanted a way to get there made up

190
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
Special days legitimised

191
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,727
And they found one

192
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Drizly

193
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
Chicago

194
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Cold

195
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
I was here to visit Holly McGuire

196
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,919
If there were a VIP Club for holidays

197
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Holly

198
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
Holly

199
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,551
Holly is the editor-in-chief

200
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
But something called chases

201
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
Calendar of

202
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,207
We walk into her office and she shows me the 2017 edition of the

203
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
It's very heavy

204
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791
I haven't weighed it

205
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:06,399
It's 752 Pages 752 pages of all kinds of holiday

206
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
Everything

207
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
From Easter Sunday

208
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
To talk like a pirate

209
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,871
You guys call yourself like the official keeper of holidays and special days little shy about

210
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
Actually doing

211
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:20,223
Seconds were in the midwest now

212
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
Spectre could be

213
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
That could be

214
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
Yes we try to be

215
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,879
Places like the Oxford English Dictionary of holidays

216
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,695
Yeah but Jesus didn't really mean to be

217
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Become that

218
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
This book started in 1957

219
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
Back then it was a pamphlet to help

220
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,375
Keep track of holidays that change around from year

221
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,215
But eventually Chase has started allowing submissions for

222
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
Special day

223
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
As they call them

224
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,591
And then when Congress issued its holiday Crackdown

225
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
The world seemed to

226
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Turn 2 Chainz

227
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,503
Bright and people started submitting to us to kind of fill that void

228
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
And this

229
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,087
Is where the search for national sports day gets in

230
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
Because

231
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
It wasn't Chase

232
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
But it isn't anymore

233
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
What

234
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
About a decade ago

235
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,327
The inventor apparently called chases or emailed or something

236
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
And ask to have it pulled

237
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Holly doesn't

238
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Know all of the details

239
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
She said she can still help

240
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
So she scoot over to her laptop she pulls up this

241
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
Which is huge

242
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,175
It's device basically every special day that's been and chases since 1990

243
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
85 thousands and thousands

244
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
Next each one

245
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Is the person

246
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Who submitted

247
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
I've organized it alphabetically and I'm in the Nationals

248
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
National soul food month

249
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,095
National soy Foods month then

250
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
There it is

251
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
National Splurge Day

252
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,727
You want to just read the text that accompanies

253
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,591
Today is the day to go out and do something extraordinarily indulge

254
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
Motto have

255
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:57,503
Fun okay and so there is a name attached with the creation of this this particular day

256
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
Yeah Adrian Sue Cooper Smith

257
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
Adrian Sue

258
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,951
National Splurge Day was not invented by a chamber of commerce

259
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,279
It was not passed during the Congressional holiday boom

260
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,839
It was invented and then rescinded

261
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
Spy woman named Adrian Sue Cooper

262
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
And we

263
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
That's a question

264
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
Coming up the last stop on our journey we meet them maker of National Splurge Day

265
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:29,503
And he's not what we expected support for this podcast in the following message come from Delta

To taking us from a TV station in Sacramento to lawmakers in Washington

270
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,055
DC to the holiday gatekeeper in Chicago

271
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
And now

272
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Chicago again

273
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Total coincidence

274
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
But yep

275
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,175
Loretta

276
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Alright I'm like

277
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
A mile away excited

278
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
I'm nervous I'm on my way to me

279
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,743
Kind of an old downtown Adrian Sue Cooper Smith lives in an apartment building in the Rogers Park neighbor

280
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
Chicago and when I get there

281
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,631
Already outside waiting for me and very concerned about my lack of

282
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,775
No no I'm okay it rains or 60s just long brown hair that she wears

283
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
She's very proudly a Leo

284
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,151
She's to be a secretary and did some freelance Public Relation

285
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Show me to take my

286
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Do we settle in

287
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
Read some cheesecake

288
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,295
And she tells me the real story behind Nash

289
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Splurge Day

290
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
It was the 1990s

291
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
It was Taxi

292
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
And she was bombed

293
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
And she thought

294
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
What is the silver lining

295
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,327
So you figure you're going to have your tax return back

296
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
Within two months and three days

297
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,471
It's okay you going to have time to think about the fact that you want to

298
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
Splurge on something

299
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Okay God bless you

300
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,127
It's my cat might catch a sneeze I would say God bless you because she's a little she's a darling

301
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Adrian decided

302
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
The two months and three days after tax

303
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
That needs to be National

304
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
So she wrote it up

305
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
Submitted it to Chase's calendar of events

306
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
The thing is

307
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
National Splurge Day

308
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
That is

309
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
Just

310
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
The beginning of it

311
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,047
Adrian how many holidays have you have you created

312
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,607
1900 that are

313
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
Legally written down

314
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
But there's more

315
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
A few blocks away to a place called Uncle Bob's Storage

316
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,223
Right after this 10-foot by 20-foot storage

317
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
So this is the Empire

318
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
In this Warehouse is Adrian's lifework

319
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,743
Hundreds and hundreds of pages of holidays or

320
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,535
She calls them holiday dates

321
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,351
She's been making these things since the 1990s

322
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,935
Alright let's go in shimmy into a storage locker

323
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
Box

324
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
Open it up

325
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
Let's see what we have

326
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
This is a whole list of

327
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Love holidays

328
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
Right here

329
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:11,039
I have my glasses on so I can't sit

330
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,343
Okay January 2nd To The Great Escape.

331
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Okay

332
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
January 16th

333
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
Dealing with the dentist day

334
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
February 6th

335
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:24,607
Pack pay a compliment

336
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,423
It's big baby that's big-time Adrian doesn't remember all of these

337
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,703
Cuz she only submitted

338
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
The best of her idea

339
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
Chase's in

340
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
She's had to run 20 of these

341
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,847
Including National Hug a GI day

342
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,639
International Skeptics day

343
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
And second honeymoon

344
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
There are a handful of

345
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
People like Adrian who are prolific

346
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,807
Holiday contributors

347
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,135
There's a guy who does pun holidays

348
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,951
There's a couple in Pennsylvania who are known for a river

349
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
Holidays

350
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Adrienne has her own style

351
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
Pur holidays fall somewhere between

352
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Quirky

353
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
And profound

354
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,911
In fact when I was visiting the Chase's calendar at

355
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,495
Holly lost penny day

356
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Her favorite Adrian Hall

357
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Lost penny day

358
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:10,687
To put aside all those pennies stashed in candy dishes coffee cans bowls and jars

359
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
Back into circulation

360
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
Celebrated Abraham Lincoln's birthday

361
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
I just think that's really Charming

362
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,391
It's a poetic little holiday

363
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Yeah and very easy

364
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
For anybody to celebrate

365
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:29,119
Your serve clutching your chest as you read that I don't always do that she sounds

366
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,983
Because Adrian's holidays aren't in Chase's anymore about 10 years ago

367
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
She asked Holly to pull them out

368
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
Which is weird but

369
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,871
Adrian had seen some of her holiday show up in commercials

370
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
Sell things in

371
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
She felt like she was losing control of the

372
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
But I talked to Adrian for our

373
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
And I actually think that there's a story that helped

374
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
Explain why these holidays mean

375
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
It starts in the 70s

376
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
She was dating this guy

377
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
He was a gorgeous

378
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
British guy

379
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,863
He was about five years older than I was I mean he was really really I didn't accent

380
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
The coolness the

381
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
Kill that kind of thing you know

382
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Adrian adored this guy

383
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
It was a bad relay

384
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
He drank

385
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
If you wanted him to go into alcoholics

386
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Synonymous

387
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Kind of did

388
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
But not really

389
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,967
So they eventually broke up and she found out later

390
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
For that he had died

391
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,831
Adrian says it was because of him in this period Of her life that she

392
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Started to think about

393
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Events

394
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
A completely different

395
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:29,279
AA is very similar to an event if you can make it through one day

396
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:35,167
And your event is not doing drugs or not drinking then yes sure that is an event

397
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,727
But that's an event about apps

398
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
It's about not doing

399
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
And there's all this pressure attached to

400
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Will you fail will you see

401
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
Succeed

402
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
To Adrian.

403
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
Maybe it would be easier or at least make

404
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
Happier

405
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
If there was always

406
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Another of

407
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
To celebrate

408
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
So I started thinking

409
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
What can you do

410
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:02,559
In lieu of doing something bad do something that's an event even if it's for a minute a day to get you through the

411
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,119
The date that pulls you away from what you're addicted by

412
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,935
That's kind of beautiful right yeah it is

413
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
But

414
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,079
Very easy very real business machine fueled by these made up holiday

415
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,919
PR people use them to get company's television time

416
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
Is a book made up of these itself

417
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
475 bucks

418
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
It's all true it's all true it's just that

419
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
I think the last thing

420
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Expected

421
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Define at the bottom of

422
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Where do these little homemade holidays

423
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,743
A woman who's not making money off of them

424
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
But who cares about these more than I knew anyone

425
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
Could ever care

426
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
About a holiday

427
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
So we're back at Adrian storage locker

428
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,519
We're still reading through that list of her holiday dates

429
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
