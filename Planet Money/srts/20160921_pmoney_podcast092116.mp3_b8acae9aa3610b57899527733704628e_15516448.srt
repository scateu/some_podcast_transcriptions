1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:04,096
Sounds like 9:30 tonight at the supermarket

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,680
For the story but also honestly because I need milk

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,544
It's amazing how much milk two little kids drink

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,504
Tell me where the milk is

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,088
It's in the very back corner

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
The store

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
Milk

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648
The funny thing

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:32,256
What are the most popular items and they put it as far as humanly possible from the entry

10
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,560
There's a kind of story about why this is

11
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,632
Maybe you've heard that my mom told this to me when I was a kid

12
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,192
You know why milk is in the back of the store she said

13
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,240
So you have to walk through the store to get it

14
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,312
Surpass all this other stuff is too gay to buy more things

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
I believe my mom

16
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,872
She's my mom

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,432
Over the years I told this story to other people

18
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:53,760
You know why milk is in the back of the store so you have to walk through the store

19
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,808
Only recently have I wondered

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,344
Is it actually true

21
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,392
Is that why milk is in the back

22
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,512
Can you really have a business model intentionally built around inconveniencing your customers

23
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,048
Has a long walk

24
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,072
Here it is

25
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,888
1 gallon whole milk

26
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,728
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm David kestenbaum today on the show

27
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,128
Turns out there are two theories big theories to answer this very little question why the milk is in the back of the store

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
Two theories that reflect very different worldviews

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,992
We tried to discover which is right

30
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:32,160
We'd like to say a quick thank you and share a message from our planet money sponsor betterment

31
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,768
Betterment has fundamentally changed the way Americans save and invest for their future

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,864
Traditional investing Solutions are expensive complicated and boring

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912
The betterment was built from the ground up

34
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,472
With sophisticated cutting-edge technology

35
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,032
It recommends personalized investment plan

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,872
Simply put betterment makes it easier more straightforward

37
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
And less expensive

41
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:09,792
We set up today show as I kind of friendly debate between two people I'm going to call them milk

42
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
The theorist

43
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:16,448
When is Michael Pollan food writer author of The Omnivore's Dilemma and many other books about food

44
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,288
Most recently cooked a natural history of transformation

45
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,616
Michael gets his milk at a small grocery store in Berkeley California

46
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
I get a

47
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
Local milk

48
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
Call Saint Benoit

49
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504
That which is not homogenized

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
But pastor

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
In his hole how far is it from the cache

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
40 sheet maybe 50 ft

53
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,952
Seattle

54
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
Yeah it's a hike

55
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,584
Also on the line I called the bay II milk theorist

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Russ rapper

57
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,448
Economist at the Hoover institution and host of the EconTalk podcast

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
Shops at Costco

59
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
For the record

60
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
Is not a milk

61
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm pretty lactose intolerance I don't drink much milk so you're disqualified from this conversation is being lactose intolerant

62
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:04,576
Walden academic I think I'm more than qualified by the fact that I don't you know much about it

63
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,184
First up Michael Pollan arguing for the idea that milk is in the back

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
The force has to walk through this door

65
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
He says stores do this kind of thing all the time

66
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,608
They're always trying to manipulate us into buying more

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,448
Grocery store she says think very carefully about where they put everything

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
What you see first when you walk in

69
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,824
They put items with higher profit margins at eye level

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,432
I've come to understand the landscape of a grocery stores I've been brilliantly designed

71
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,504
Landscape to get us to buy as much food and as much

72
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,528
Expensive food

73
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,112
So my general impression is that the milk is

74
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Is

75
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Is in the back

76
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
And it's

77
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,536
But it's not just milk is in the back but it's also usually very far from the bread

78
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
Both of them are very common items

79
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
That everybody needs

80
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,192
And so it makes you cover a lot of ground

81
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,800
If you want them Michael is there one thing that when you walk by in the store you have a hard time not buying

82
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
I buy a lot of things I didn't come there to buy and that's really typical there in one study something like only a

83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,296
Third of the items bought in the store where on the grocery list or plan for

84
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,440
So you'll see some cool new cracker in your Biotin and you might not notice that it's $6 for a little box

85
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,280
Is that Michael view the first Dairy R Us has a very different View

86
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
The stories she says

87
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375
Are not in the business of trying to manipulate us

88
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,703
They are trying to give us the best shopping experience possible

89
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
They have to

90
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,031
Because of this basic economic principle

91
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
Competition

92
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
Supermarket business is very competitive

93
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
Stores have to please us he says

94
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
Or we'll go to another store

95
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,503
Russ thinks the reason the milk is in the back

96
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
Is practical

97
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
It's easier to keep the milk cold

98
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:47,487
The delivery trucks come into the back of the store milk goes right into this refrigerated room that soften right behind the cooler

99
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
Where you grab your milk

100
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,839
Known as to love the milk through the store cuz I'm cooler in the front

101
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Milk spoils very easily

102
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,239
I was told that for every degree of temperature rises it loses a day

103
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
Being available and being sellable

104
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,895
So the argument I'm making which is kind of a radical argument is that

105
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:10,527
You and I want the milk in the back even though it's a little less convenient if we're in the front be more expensive

106
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Are not willing to

107
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Pay that extra price

108
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,647
So I think they're actually doing what we want out what they were

109
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,719
Russ is it probably cheaper to have milk in the back

110
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
That keeps the cost down for the store

111
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
And for you the customer

112
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Russell points out that

113
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,447
If hiding stuff people want in the back of your store is really a good business strategy

114
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Why don't other stores do

115
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
Why don't bookstore

116
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
Put the best sellers in the back

117
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
They don't

118
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,639
Turn the front they don't make you go through the

119
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,199
Elizabethan poetry not that we wouldn't be better people

120
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
For it

121
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,551
If we had to go through that section but they tend to put it in the front

122
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
How to make it easy

123
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
Ayto Michael you think of his argument

124
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
It's there to serve the

125
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:53,279
Well I think a Russ's assuming a greater degree of rationality in the America

126
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
Summer than the designers of supermarket

127
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,911
They're trying to work on us

128
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Subliminal level

129
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,543
Even like the music you know that the number of beats per minute or per second

130
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
In in the music played in supermarkets

131
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,407
Is designed to slow us down

132
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
And get us not to rush through

133
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
And enter that that

134
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,319
Interesting dream like state that comes over people in supermarket

135
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,367
They've studied our blink rate

136
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,951
Supermarkets in we blink last in the supermarket as we're gradually

137
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
Slowed and lulled into

138
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
State of

139
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
She maybe I should try the

140
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Best new cereal

141
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,935
You think there's something in the air that there that they're blowing in Vegas drowsy or you're that worried

142
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,287
I have no evidence of that okay

143
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
I've got two very different world.

144
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,919
When rice goes to the supermarket he thinks competition is a wonderful thing

145
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,479
Look at how it forces the store to keep cost down

146
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
Look how well laid out the store

147
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
I'm in charge

148
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
When Michael Pollan goes through a supermarket

149
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
He's suspicious

150
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
Why are there certain brands of beers and not others

151
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,767
Why does the granola always seem to be so hard to find

152
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
To him the owners aren't

153
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,143
And they're making decisions that aren't always in his best interest

154
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,471
Rustan's grocery stores profit by helping customers

155
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,031
Michael thinks they also profit by manipulate

156
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
Michael Andros went back and forth

157
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
And then Michael Pollan said this

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,223
What you could instead of having two people you know speculating about it

159
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
And bringing their theories of the world to bear on the

160
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
Ask question that we don't

161
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Clear we don't have a lot of empirical

162
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Go data on

163
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
You could ask

164
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
Somebody who might actually

165
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Do you have any

166
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Have the answer

167
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,279
I could I could be a reporter it actually

168
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,351
Go and answer that's so tedious

169
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,447
So I'm just saying it's another way we could

170
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
We could go after

171
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,775
I decided to try to track down the answer

172
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,103
I got her intern here to look up the top 10 grocery chains

173
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
I called and send emails

174
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Made more calls

175
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
I found industry Consultants who advise on store layout

176
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,783
And I got six people willing to talk on tape

177
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,623
People in a position to know the answer people who know about milk

178
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
I tried not to buy them

179
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Just asked where is the milk in your store and why

180
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,535
When I was done I got Michael Pollan and Russ Roberts on the phone

181
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
I reff

182
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Hello

183
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
I play them excerpts from each of the interview so they could react

184
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
And we could keep score

185
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
First up

186
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
BJ's Wholesale

187
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
Major competitor to Costco and Sam's Club

188
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
Over 200 stores from Maine to Florida

189
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,407
I talked to Rob Olson Dairy buyer

190
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,807
Do you go through a lot of milk is that right regular gallon milk we sell millions of gallons a year and if I walk into one of your stores

191
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Where is the

192
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,695
The milk is in the dairy cooler which is located in the back of all of our clubs

193
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,999
Is it right that milk is one of the most popular items

194
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
At the store

195
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
Why it so why is it in the back

196
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
Traditionally I think

197
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
And this is just my own opinion

198
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
I believe

199
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,543
We want members or customers

200
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,895
To get to the back of the club and see the wide array of items that we carry

201
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,199
It is it gets them into the store I guess

202
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
Look at the other stuff inside out maybe I need that too

203
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
Correct

204
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
We call it building the basket

205
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
In the business

206
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
What do you guys think

207
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,439
I love the phrase building the basket

208
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,559
Like really talked to the Same by Michael talked to

209
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,679
Michael said he'd always hurt and this guy hurt the same thing the same guy

210
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
Second hand

211
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,079
Exactly

212
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Hearsay

213
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:23,711
I was tempted to give this one to Michael the guy after all had a phrase for the idea building the basket

214
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,783
But it turns out he had another phrase also

215
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
The cold chain

216
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
There's another reason we put milk in the back of head

217
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
To preserve the cold chain

218
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:37,791
Daddy is at once the milk comes out of a cow gets pasteurized and putting that gallon jug

219
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
You never want to take the milk out of a refrigerated environment

220
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,191
You want to keep it cold every step of the way

221
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
Very very important person

222
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
It's brought into a cold room

223
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
And it kept in this cold room

224
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
It goes from the cold room

225
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
The coal truck

226
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
Wacoal Distribution Center

227
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
Factorio coal truck

228
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,783
To the club or store and its constant

229
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Call Nicole Chang

230
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,159
After the call the pr person for BJ's assured me this was the primary reason

231
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
I don't know

232
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
I gave Rustin Michael each a

233
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:11,839
I also talked to Kroger 2400 stores in 34 states

234
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,887
The pr person they're also mentioned both

235
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,959
So again I gave Russ and Michael each point

236
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,519
The next answer that was not ambiguous

237
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Kevin Lang works for Wegmans

238
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
Is a store manager in King of Prussia Pennsylvania

239
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
The reason for us

240
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:30,015
Why we have milk in the back is because that's where milk comes in so therefore

241
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,879
We don't have to worry about ever breaking the cold chain I think it's a consumer misconception

242
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
Diagonal

243
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,767
Retailers put milk in the back of the store to make you walk through the entire store it's not true

244
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,351
So he he really I think I got to go Point Ross

245
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,471
And it's a fabulous grocery store but

246
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,031
Fun2give Michael is due

247
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
Describe his incentive

248
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:59,199
Not to suggested it some Sinister policy to get people to buy stuff that we do I keep that in mind

249
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,039
Yeah nobody want none of these retards want to admit they're manipulating their consumers

250
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
Yeah I'm amazed Michael got to vote already

251
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Yeah

252
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,927
It was a fair point which is why I also called him Consulting

253
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
Since to ask them what the Inside Story

254
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,047
Burt Flickinger has advised lots of supermarkets

255
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
He's managing director of a place called strategic Resource Group

256
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,935
I tell the retailers to put the milk in the

257
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:25,055
Front of the store for the convenience of the customers in the Retailer's typically ignore my advice

258
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
I am put the milk

259
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,943
Yeah in the back of the store where they've been putting it for 70 to 80 years

260
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
Why do they say they want to put

261
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,039
Back to the supermarket said they want to put it in back

262
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,319
Because it's

263
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:41,183
Hi it's it's easier for delivery agency of her stocking

264
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
So they say it's for convenience sake

265
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
Cheaper left labor I all of the above

266
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
They don't say it

267
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,631
So that people have to walk through a store and see other thing

268
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
And then they say we want

269
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
The people that walk through this stores

270
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,335
And bye-bye every everything we sell

271
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
Reaction

272
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
Oh that's another split boat there

273
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
Yeah probably

274
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Point reach

275
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
I should mention that both Kroger in Wegmans in a lot of their stores do have small coolers in the front as Berg recommends so people in a hurry

276
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
We can just grab them

277
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,023
At this moment Michael Pollan was behind the count but he was just down by one point

278
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
And the next person with someone

279
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
She had selected

280
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
Brian wansink

281
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,703
Cornell professor expert in all the ways we get tricked when it comes to

282
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
But

283
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
Wangjing sided with Russ

284
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,079
He told me it's in the back

285
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,871
Just so they can keep the milk cold

286
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,687
Store managers he says are not playing Sigmund Freud

287
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,759
They're more worried about whether the cashiers are stealing from the register

288
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
When it comes to milk

289
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,599
It's in the back because it's just much easier to have it there

290
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,487
Piercings going on in Scotia

291
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,071
What matters most bottom-line savings

292
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,119
The money is in the panties to begin with

293
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Are tickets for

294
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,727
Real consumers you can design your own thrift store

295
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:02,079
Eventually after the second or third iteration is in the back

296
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,663
If we designed them ourselves we put them in the back

297
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,223
All right

298
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,527
Michael what were you thinking having him call that guy

299
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,647
Report against yourself

300
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,559
It's taking a lot of you got to know what your Witnesses are going to be able to put them on the stand

301
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,935
I did my best Michael the truth

302
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
Call you put you in a very small Club Sur

303
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
Dial the truth

304
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,663
I think we have this idea in economics in a lot of things really that when there is a question there is an answer

305
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
But tonight there just isn't

306
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
Stores themselves may not

307
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,063
Even have a clear idea of why they're doing what they're doing

308
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,647
It's not like there's some binders every supermarkets headquarters title

309
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
Optimum milk placement in Dallas

310
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,279
I think the real question here unfortunately is a hypothetical

311
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,095
I put it to our last expert Jim Hotel

312
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
Supermarket consultant

313
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,679
Managing partner at a place called Willard Bishop

314
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
If it were easy to put the milk up front

315
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
Do you think stores would do it

316
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
Well there's a dairy

317
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
There's somebody who's

318
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
Running the dairy Department

319
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
Nintendo stock

320
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
And they can just put it wherever

321
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
Do you think stores would do it

322
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
No I don't

323
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
You don't think they would

324
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
I'd know I think

325
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
They like having people

326
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
Product

327
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Probably operational

328
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,543
Reasons why it's there I think that the the secondary or the side benefit of having people walk through

329
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
The store

330
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
It's very comfy

331
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
Michael given that one to you all right

332
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
Fair enough I give that one to my

333
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Alright so

334
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
I don't know guys it's like

335
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
Rails has one

336
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Two three

337
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
Four five

338
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
And Michael has one too

339
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
Should we call this when I draw

340
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
Yeah

341
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
I'm happy I'm happy

342
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
Did you ask your

343
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,007
Let me let me ask the obvious question did this change either of your thinking

344
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,823
Well I think when I'm asked about this

345
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,175
In the future I will be more Folsom in my answer and make sure I

346
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,711
I pay at the fishing

347
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
Attention to the

348
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
To the idea of

349
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Dakota

350
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Russ

351
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:27,487
It reminds me of the importance of culture and history and some businesses Asians but I think

352
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
Which I think plays a role

353
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
But I do think

354
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
The competitive forces pretty powerful

355
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,703
I'm willing to concede that I may sometimes overestimate its power

356
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,031
In certain industries it doesn't work so well but I don't think it's this one

357
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
I think if someone asked you

358
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
Is the milk in the back of the store because it's easier

359
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
