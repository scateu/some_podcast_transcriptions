We return from vacation this week

00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,272
And found that the World As We Know It

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,808
Seems like it is about to

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:29,440
We are not talking about nuclear war or natural disasters although there is that too

9
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,744
We're talkin about the economic

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
Because somehow with everything happening this summer

12
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,376
Someone Congress

13
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Forgot

Is these are all traps that Congress has set

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
For themselves

00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
Let's start with

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
The Dead Sea

60
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,336
Because talking about the debt ceiling

61
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Drive

62
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Mean.

00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,456
It is simultaneously both the most dangerous

00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
Fing

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
The Congress mucks around

66
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
And it is

67
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
The stupidest

68
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
Here's the way I like to think of

69
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
Any picture in your mind

70
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
The most valuable thing in the world

71
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
The Hope Diamond

72
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280

00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Sodium is worth

76
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
But I would argue that the most valuable thing in the world

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Is

78
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,008
Faith and the trust

79
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
The people have

80
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
In the US Capitol

81
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
Fine

82
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
That's not cool

83
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
No but it is worth

84
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
20

85
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Trillian

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
Dollars because that is what people

87
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,320
In this country and around the world have lent to the US government

88
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
People have bought

89
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,904
Twenty trillion dollars worth of government bonds

90
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Because

91
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
It is the safest investment in the world

92
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,024
It's true the US government always pays its

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
Dexter butt

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Every few years Congress

95
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
Come close to screwing this up

96
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
When its face is this

97
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Debt ceiling

98
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
The debt ceiling

99
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
The debt ceiling was a law passed by Congress

100
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
100 years ago

101
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
And it said

102
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
Okay we should limit our debt to at the time

103
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
A few billion dollars

104
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
And if the country grew

105
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,320
It had to keep erasing that number every few years and put in a Higher One

106
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344
Currently

107
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
At

108
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,184
Twenty trillion dollars we are very close days away

109
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Hitting a ceiling

110
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
Coming up on this number

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Really fast

112
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,863
And if the government hits that arbitrary limit it can no longer borrow anymore

113
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
All of a sudden

114
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,495
The government would literally not have enough money to pay for everything it has promised to pay for

115
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
It couldn't pay

116
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,567
The interest to those nice people who lent

117
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
Entrusted us

118
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,407
It might not be able to pay for government salaries

119
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
Are Social Security payments

120
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
Or pay for Medicare or Medicaid Ed Klein Bart

121
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
He's a professor at USC

122
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
Who is study the Dead

123
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
Because we are hoping that he could help us

124
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,207
Make sense of this whole thing

125
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
Small problem though

126
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
It is

127
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:54,911
Completely senseless it is a nonsensical concept is unnecessary for running the government

128
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,775
And the ultimately correct answers just to get rid of it

129
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,615
Congress decides what the government is going to spend

130
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
That is it

131
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Constitution

132
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
And Congress also decide

133
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,295
How much tax revenue it's going to be

134
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,623
Bring it every year Congress spends more than it

135
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
Takes in by a lot

136
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
They know this

137
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
So logically

138
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,535
They have to borrow money to make up the difference

139
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,095
They have essentially said we need to borrow money

140
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
And yet

141
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
Congress has to schedule an extra vote

142
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,287
To raise the debt ceiling and borrow the money that they have already decided

143
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
To borrow many Americans

144
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,711
Misunderstand the debt ceiling and think that it is the driver of debt

145
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,831
When it's not at all it's not the driver that just the result of spending if you don't like

146
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
The US

147
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,159
United States having a lot of debt

148
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,999
Well then you should tell Congress to spend less or tax more

149
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
But the debt ceiling is is it just an artifact

150
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
Because the debt ceiling is a vote

151
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Hosta

152
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
No matter what

153
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,775
This allows any party to hold the country hostage until they get something that they want

154
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,567
In years past it has been

155
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
Conservative Republicans specifically

156
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,223
Who didn't like some form of government spending and they were threatening to vote against raising the debt

157
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
And then they extract

158
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Concessions

159
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
This year it appears

160
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
It is Democrat

161
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Score stalling raisin

162
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,951
As we record this right now

163
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
Does a deal in the works

164
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
Queen President Trump

165
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
And Democrats to put off the debt ceiling for

166
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Three more months but

167
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:33,215
All that means is that we'll be talking about economic disaster scenarios again

168
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
In December

169
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
It is I have to admit

170
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:40,127
Pretty good block because if we do not raise the debt ceiling if we default on US debt

171
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
It'll be a global night

172
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,479
The entire Financial system of the world

173
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Banks

174
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783

177
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
All have at their Foundation

178
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
This really safe investment US Treasury

179
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
And all of a sudden this is not

180
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
The world's safest investment anymore

181
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
That's cause

182
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Panic

183
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
And here in the US

184
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
40% of government spending is borrowed

185
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
If we do not raise the debt ceiling

186
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,543
Lots of people who expect to get paid

187
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
One way or another

188
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
Will not get paid

189
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
I want that happens

190
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,455
He got a reception because all of a sudden

191
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
If I don't have money

192
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:22,111
For my salary as a at the government employee for example I can't pay my mortgage

193
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
I can't pay my grocery bills

194
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
And so

195
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
It trickles throughout the economy

196
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
All of a sudden

197
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
Income is missing

198
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,655
It's also stupid because it is unnecessary

199
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
Congress could just

200
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
Approve

201
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,263
The borrowing when it approves

202
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Spending

203
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
But for some reason

204
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,663
They you have 2-year shackle themselves to this debt ceiling

205
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
Timebomb they do always

206
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
Diffuse it at the last second

207
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
But who knows two different year

208
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Different Congress

209
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Mr President

210
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
It is worth noting even if Congress

211
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Texas Thrift

212
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Brink of default and pulls back at the last moment

213
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
There's only

214
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,791
So many times you can do that

215
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
And keep the world

216
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
When I hear that sound like I feel

217
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Felix wet

218
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Pops out

219
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
On my on my forehead

220
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Can I sweating

221
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Okay

222
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,503
So Congress is sweating it out of the debt-limit thing

223
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,903
But it is not the only thing on their plate the second thing that they have to worry about right now right this moment fact they are behind

224
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
Time schedule on it

225
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
Is

226
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
The Federal Bar

227
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
Here's how a budget is supposed to come

228
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Early in the year

229
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
The president presents

230
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
His own budget

231
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,911
His priorities

232
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
His outline

233
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
The house

234
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
And the Senate they throw it in the garbage

235
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Or

236
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,079
The fourth day take it

237
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,943
Ending choose to ignore some of those priorities and take other than each come up with their own budget

238
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Those are essentially

239
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
Outlines they don't have a lot of

240
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
Details it that because the details

241
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
Are figured out bicycle

242
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,207
Appropriations subcommittees there are 12 in the house there 12 in the Senate

243
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,767
And then they divvy up the money and then they're supposed to pass

244
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,863
12 Appropriations bills in each and then you have to think all these up and make sure been spending the same money

245
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,935
All of this has to get done by the end of September

246
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
The end of the fiscal

247
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
Unfortunately

248
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
It almost never comes to

249
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Raw procrastinators here totally understand

250
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Except every few years

251
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
The Congress is

252
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,735
Pushing it in pushing it the fighting over it and they

253
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
Fail to fund themselves

254
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,855
And you heard of this they have to shut down the Federal

255
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
It was one of the

256
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Worst days

257
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:37,535
That I had a job

258
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,631
That's the department that includes everything from the US Geological Survey to

259
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
The Bureau of Indian Affairs to the Nash

260
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,519
And almost as soon as Sally started the job you know she got hurt

261
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,919
Her little ID badge and here's where the stapler is

262
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,991
Ground so beautiful but she also got word

263
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
Hey you know what

264
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:04,415
You're going to need to make an emergency plan for the Department of the Interior because it is looking an awful lot

265
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
Like Congress is not going to managed

266
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
The past the bills that are going to fund the government

267
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,095
And sure enough within 8 months of starting the job

268
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
It happened

269
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,679
To me it was just incredulity

270
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,287
I mean like is this really happening we are actually shutting down the largest

271
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,591
Organization on the planet

272
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,943
Because people cannot get their act together to provide a budget to keep

273
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
The doors open and in what

274
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
What a waste

275
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Of resources

276
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,623
It's empty the normal jobs Sally's employees were being paid

277
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Do you know

278
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,975
Shut down the Washington Monument before they were furloughed themselves

279
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,559
So they didn't like drag barricades into protected and drained

280
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
Water fountains in lock bathrooms input

281
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
National Park

282
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Closed signs up for the

283
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
The poor lost tourists

284
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
For foreigners visiting our country

285
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
They said what what do you mean

286
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
Your government has shut down

287
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
How do you explain that to

288
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
You know it tourist from

289
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,503
China who's been planning this trip for 5 years

290
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
The 2013 shutdown lasted for 16 days

291
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
Is one of the longest government shutdowns and Reese

292
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,487
I was talking to one of our colleagues Ron elving easterly NPR's master

293
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,791
Of politics talk about this particular

294
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,839
Time Bomb issue and he said

295
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
You know

296
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
These kinds of shutdowns

297
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
Happened maybe more than you say

298
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
It is probably

299
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
The best reason not to use the

300
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
Time Bomb metaphor

301
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
Because in the end it is not really

302
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
An explosion

303
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
So much as it is

304
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,247
It if you could call it an erosion of the things that people

305
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Pandora

306
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
In the last 40 years there have been

307
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
18

308
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Different shut down

309
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
Because Congress could not agree on a

310
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
And many of those were just a day or two and

311
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,047
And shut down like shut down sound a little more

312
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
Harsh that it actually is

313
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Because

314
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
Essential Personnel do get to keep work

315
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
We didn't send home the air traffic

316
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,287
Controllers we didn't bring all of our troops home from their far-flung

317
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
Missions around the world

318
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,455
And we didn't stop inspecting the meat you know that sort of thing now if you did all those things

319
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,503
If all of the federal government's funk

320
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
Literally stop

321
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
That would be

322
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Completely different animal

323
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
If the

324
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
The biggest impact

325
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
Of government shutdowns is usually

326
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,535
Political you can make this very good argument that Bill Clinton

327
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,095
Bill Clinton got reelected in 1996

328
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
Because because there's been these two

329
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Big

330
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
Federal shutdown

331
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,031
And people ended up blaming Newt Gingrich and Republicans for them

332
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
And Bill Clinton actually came out of them looking pretty good

333
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
Iran tells us that

334
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
The shutdowns do service

335
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
Every member of Congress

336
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,991
How to make tough body

337
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
Sometimes decisions that might look

338
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Bad to their constituents back home

339
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,439
Being able to say well you know I had to make a hard vote in a hard choice because

340
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,535
The clock was running out the government going to shut down that's something that constituents

341
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
Might swallow a little

342
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Senescence

343
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
It's not that the shutdown is a real

344
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,959
Explosive ticking time bomb

345
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:02,335
Yeah because in Hollywood the bomb is there to create suspense so that the hero can swoop in and Save

346
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
The day and innocence

347
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
That itself is his metaphor for Congress

348
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,015
Will just answer the question I've always had which is

349
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
I've never understood

350
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,087
Why you have

351
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
Big flashing

352
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Digital numbers

353
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
On the bottom just to make it

354
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Easier to

355
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
Diffuse for the hero

356
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,583
But of course like the whole Congressional process is

357
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
All about the number

358
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
It's the number

359
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
10

360
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Rite Aid

361
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Right

362
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Well that's for the audience.

363
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,871
The right because you're trying to make the audience

364
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
Feal suspension

365
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
You're trying to make the audience

366
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
See consequence

367
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
Cuz if the hero doesn't do something heroic

368
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
And that's an impression

369
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,879
That they are trying to create in their political audience

370
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,719
Much of the way the makers of Thrillers are trying to get their audiences

371
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
Normal year

372
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
This could be

373
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,167
Brinkmanship and games and not have a severe impact

374
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
Remember this is not a normal year

375
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
Because as they are going to

376
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
The process they also have to do the first time we talked

377
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
Definitely have to do it at the same time

378
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,455
As of this recording it looks like the deal that's coming together is going to

379
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,247
Porsche budget negotiations

380
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Down the road

381
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Into December

382
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,623
And so instead of getting to deal with each of these issues individually

383
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
Congress has taken

384
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Two time bombs

385
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
And made them one

386
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Giant

387
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
And that's not all

388
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
There's one

389
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
More huge issue

390
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
They have to deal with

391
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
We'll talk about that after the break

392
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
Support for this podcast

393
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:40,383
And the following message come from State Farm whose agents know that your car and home are more than just big party

394
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
They're a big part of your life

395
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
You put the time into making them your own

396
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
So now it's time to protect them

397
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,599
With your own personal State Farm agent

398
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,647
Not only do they truly get

399
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
But they'll be there for you when you need them

400
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,047
And with over 19,000 agents in neighborhoods across the US

401
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
There could be one just around the corner

402
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
Moritz statefarm.com

403
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
Are 1-800 State Farm

404
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
State Farm

405
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Here to help life

406
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,007
Go right

407
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,823
You know when you're watching a thriller

408
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
And sometimes one of the sidekicks get

409
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Killed off or

410
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,479
Or weirdly like just disappears for no apparent reason

411
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
And no one really mentions it or makes a big deal about it

412
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
Julie DeWitt

413
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Will you take the empty seat

414
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
It is now in the studio

415
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
Niacin

416
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Yeah I don't know why

417
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
Julia is here to talk about the other

418
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Huge thing

419
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
The Congress has to deal with

420
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,959
Is fall something you put off dealing with for a long long

421
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Time

422
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
I'm referring to immigration or more specifically

423
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
Deferred action for childhood arrivals

424
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
So you probably

425
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
Heard about this

426
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
This week DACA was this policy

427
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,111
Obama administration that gave some protection to this one like really specific group of undocumented in

428
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,951
All these rules you had to be under 31 years old

429
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,255
Your parents had to have brought you to the United States

430
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
Before you were 16 years old

431
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
You also had to be like an X

432
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
Exceptional member of

433
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
Society so

434
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Your criminal record

435
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,263
Squeaky clean image of been in or have a graduate

436
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
High school or college or served

437
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,335
In the military and Jen

438
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
Discharged

439
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
And then you had to

440
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,919
Apply for DACA permit

441
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Pay lunch money

442
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,015
And what's amazing is even though they were all of these

443
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Hurdles

444
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Around 8

445
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Hundred

446
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Thousand

447
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
Young people applied

448
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
For this docker protection

449
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,207
Animal lasted 2 years you had to

450
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
Play for every two years

451
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,559
What you got in exchange

452
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Four Points Raleigh

453
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
Poop Squad

454
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
Your life changed into big wave

455
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
You could stop worrying all the time because you were

456
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,751
We're shielded from deportation

457
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
And

458
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
You could work

459
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
Legal you had a social security number

460
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
Doing something for this group

461
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
The dreamers

462
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
People out there

463
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
DACA

464
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,015
It's not actually that controversial on is

465
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,063
What was controversial with

466
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
The way up

467
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
A biologist

468
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
Went around Congress

469
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Schism

470
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
Weather for obvious reasons

471
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,303
Because as we appointed out time and time again in his podcast

472
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Congress has

473
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Trouble getting things

474
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,447
And they could not for the life of themselves solve

475
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,775
This particular part of the immigration problem even though they

476
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
Debated about it for over a

477
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Decade

478
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,127
Because the fate of these dreamers with

479
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Tangled Up

480
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
In a lot of the other

481
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:27,295
Fraud immigration reform issues and so everything just stayed in a big tangle of ball

482
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
And that's what Obama

483
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
Was trying to

484
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,671
TSO in 2012 Obama was like

485
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,999
Screw it might be voted out of office in a few months I'm just going to

486
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Do that thing

487
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,863
And with one stroke of the president pen DACA came to be

488
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
But what is created with a stroke

489
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
Pain

490
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
Can be undone

491
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
With a stroke

492
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
I'm here today to announce

493
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
Set the program

494
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
Known as DACA

495
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
That was effectuated

496
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,199
Under the Obama Administration

497
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
Is being rescinded

498
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:01,087
Stephanie General Jeff sessions from this past Tuesday and in session to President Trump

499
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
We're pretty wildly about the

500
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,927
This whole thing because I didn't just

501
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
Withdraw the duck

502
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
Simply said you know what

503
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,839
We're not going to let these protections start to expire for six months so

504
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Covers

505
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
You been putting it off

506
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Putting it off

507
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
You have

508
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
6 months

509
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
To fix it

510
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
Dreamers are pretty haidian

511
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
On average they were

512
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
6 years old when they came to

513
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
Some of them are in

514
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
And everything is

515
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,759
You know sort of by definition

516
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,855
The people who are covered by DACA were you no pick to be sort of these

517
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
Extraordinary members the community until they have been

518
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Extra visible

519
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
This generation

520
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,327
Kids themselves having grown up in the US has been

521
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
More comfortable

522
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
Being

523
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:52,287
Out is unauthorized immigrants more comfortable standing up for themselves more comfortable interacting with American institutions

524
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,359
Then say their parents were that is Dara Lind

525
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
She's a reporter at 4 box

526
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,943
And she's done a lot of really great reporting on the

527
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
Because she

528
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,807
Great historical

529
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
View

530
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,671
Of of DACA and immigration as it affects

531
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
These young people

532
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,487
And we put it out there

533
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,327
Who reason this was a problem in the first place was because

534
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,167
Of Congress because of a string of unintended consequences

535
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,983
It came from changes in Immigration policy

536
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
1996

537
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Congress

538
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
Tough-on-crime tough on

539
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Grecian

540
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
So they pass this law which may

541
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
Makes it a lot harder to cross

542
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
The Mexican

543
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,903
Yeah you know more surveillance more officers patrolling the sort of thing was meant to reduce undocumented immigration

544
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,207
What are allowances

545
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,535
When you build a wall you don't keep people out you keep people in

546
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Weider explains it is like

547
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
For decades

548
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
People mostly mad

549
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Flowed back and forth

550
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
Between Mexico and United

551
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,239
They came for work

552
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,079
And then when the work was over when they had enough money they would go back to their families in Mexico

553
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
When Congress

554
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
Lockdown the Border

555
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,687
People still came over

556
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,039
What was different was that it became too dangerous to come and go and

557
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,063
Go back and forth

558
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,903
So when undocumented immigrants when men came here to work

559
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
They stayed

560
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
And

561
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,279
They brought their family they brought their young kids with

562
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,095
So what you end up having is

563
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,167
A population of people who are

564
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
Semi-permanently on authorized

565
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,055
I even if they are as they develop ties to

566
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,639
America and develop connections to American citizens

567
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
But

568
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
Are totally routed because they're stuck

569
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
So because of bees

570
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
You know

571
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831
Probably well-meaning laws

572
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
There was this generation stuff

573
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,951
Estimated to be around a million

574
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
Young people at the time there

575
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
General in their twenties now these dreamers

576
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,631
They were stuck in this country couldn't travel back and forth across the border and

577
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
Did not have a path

578
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
To become

579
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
And even trouble

580
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
Himself has

581
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
Express sympathy

582
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:05,407
For this dreamer generation yesterday about how DACA recipients have nothing to worry about

583
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
What Trump did this past week

584
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
Was actually

585
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Pretty sad

586
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271
Toby takes this whole mess

587
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,111
He gets attacked the Congress start in the first place and this time

588
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
Set timer

589
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
Forest around here

590
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:22,560
A ticking time bomb.

591
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
It's going to be

592
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,376
A really stressful Falls

593
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
But it's also

594
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
Going to be really stressful

595
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
For all of us

596
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
Economy

597
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
Especially for the dreamers

598
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,128
There's a very

599
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
Narrow path

600
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
The success

601
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
Which is possible

602
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
As long as they do not cut

603
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
The red wire

604
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:50,976
I thought you said we should cut the red wire

605
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:59,936
If you are in New York City this weekend you should come on over to you now hear this podcast Festival

Thanks

629
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
It's a what I'm thinking here is

630
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,592
Just so we have like a final scene in the final scene leaked pictures

631
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,920
The sun is coming up over New York City

632
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
And the camera store

633
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Zooms in

634
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,760
On Julian die

635
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,576
We're dressed all in black and what's their standing over

636
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,160
An empty cubicle and then you can see in the background of hits of Kenny Malone

637
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
And Julie you like you put a

638
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,768
Bouquet of flowers down on the desk

639
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
And you say

640
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
He would have liked the end of

641
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
Podcast

642
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
He would have

643
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,680
I think he's listening somewhere and

644
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,216
When we really need him

645
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
When Congress gets close to the cliff

646
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
You'll be back
