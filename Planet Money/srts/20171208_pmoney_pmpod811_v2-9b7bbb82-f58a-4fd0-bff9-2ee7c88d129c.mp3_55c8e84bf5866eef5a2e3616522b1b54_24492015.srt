00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:00,768
Stacy

2
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,816
Roberts it's launch day

3
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,608
Launch date for the Planet Money satellite

4
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,144
October 31st

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,680
2017

6
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,240
Halloween today the Planet Money satellite

7
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,008
Pod1

8
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,312
Is going to space

9
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,104
So course the first thing we have to do

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
Is join the lunch crew at a restaurant for pancakes

11
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:18,944
Because

12
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,712
Tradition

13
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,480
Of course

14
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
If you have like a

15
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,320
Montana tonight we're doing pancakes now

16
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
Because that's bad

17
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,160
Part of how we get ready for lunch

18
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,744
If we didn't eat pancakes one time and the rocket

19
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,792
I didn't make it to orbit

20
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,352
So we don't mess around with that anymore

21
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,168
The pancake God are not to be trifled with

22
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,192
Get an omelet

23
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Loser Rock

24
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:47,360
So that was Mike safian and Chester Gilmore from the company Planet you may remember them they helped build the Planet Money satellite

25
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,432
And they make sure it got here to the coast of California for the

26
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
The planet pay for the loss

27
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,296
They're sending up a bunch of small satellites on the same Rock

28
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
It is hours

29
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
And so they get the ceremonial place of honor

30
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,184
Chester you always wears a bow tie

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,048
He will be sitting in mission control as the spacecraft on Mission director

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,120
Highest authority over lunch

33
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
What's that mean you can at the last minute just say like

34
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,776
Proponents say no go and everything stops

35
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,568
He is so

36
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,408
Proud of this title and everyone else at the table just serve rolls their eyes

37
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,224
Assembly company they work for is one of those laid back

38
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,808
Silicon Valley firms but on lunch date there is military

39
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Precision

40
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
Definite IR

41
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,696
All of the team leaders sit in a room with headsets staring at screen

42
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
Working commands in the radio

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
Waiting for Chester

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,608
So if things go perfectly all I'll say is go a couple times

45
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
SMD go for launch

46
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
SM Diego Forlan

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,752
There's a lot riding on that command

48
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,800
This is the first time planet has filled

49
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Any Tire rocket

50
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
With just their satellite

51
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,456
They're taking all of the risk improving a small satellite

52
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760
They can have a rocket just like the big kit

53
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,320
People care about the future of the space business

54
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
Are watching this lunch

55
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
And then there's us

56
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
Anti-satellite pod1

57
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,024
A podcast launching a satellite into space

58
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,328
And this is our one shot

59
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
We're not going to get a second

60
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,824
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith Robert Smith we have a checklist ready for system check

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
Ready rocket status

62
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,200
Safety team

63
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,528
Not sure what you do but are you ready

64
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Chester do the honors

65
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Let's do it

66
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:44,096

I want to rock it

74
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
You need to think

75
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
What three things continue the rocket

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
But you also need a vast empty space with no key

77
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
People from miles around

78
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
And

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,496
An incredible technical infrastructure of radar and Communications equipment

80
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
That is why we are launching from a military

81
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,640
Rebase just north of Santa Barbara California Vandenberg Air Force

82
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Which at least on this morning

83
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,504
Might be the most deserted place on the California coast

84
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,552
I'm lunch date the military

85
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
Clears the bee

86
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:41,184
Keep boats away stop planes from flying overhead this is a completely commercial

87
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
Orbital ATK built the rocket

88
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
Planet Rent to the space on board for it's sad

89
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,888
Because it's on a military base there are military personnel involved in every pot

90
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:53,216
Part of the lunch and Military protocols and Military traditions

91
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,568
I didn't personally I just wanted to see a little satellite Pod 1 blast into space

92
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,640
But there are things that we had to do first

93
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
We had paperwork

94
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
And earrings

95
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
We had to run around the

96
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,552
First stop is a bland little office building called

97
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
J spot

98
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
Like Spock Spock

99
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,464
Like SPOC operations center

100
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,815
This are the air traffic control of space we have to check in with them

101
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
To make sure I satellite isn't being launched

102
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
Smack-dab into

103
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
Another satellite

104
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Boom

105
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,287
Lieutenant Colonel Mia Walsh and Diana mckissick are already on the case

106
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
And they're probably doing a check right about now

107
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,967
To make sure that our rocket will make it through and nothing but clear space ahead frac

108
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
So we will track it all the way from when it launches as it goes through its different trajectories as it reaches its final orbit and then we'll monitor

109
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Entire time

110
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,463
Facebook the keeper of a list that I've never heard of before

111
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,303
The space catalog which is exactly as amazing as it sounds

112
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
The space catalog

113
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
Is a list

114
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
Everything

115
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
Anyone has ever said

116
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Indoor

117
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
The catalog

118
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,335
Self includes every single object man-made objects and Sputnik

119
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
However currently we only track

120
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,223
23000 objects that are currently still on Orbitz

121
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,295
The wage a spark traxys 23,000 objects

122
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
Is amazing

123
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
They have radar and telescopes and they actually

124
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
Watch

125
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
The object moving through the sky they can spot something the size

126
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
Bubba softball

127
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Hurtling around the planet

128
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,191
And over the life of our satellite if our little pod one gets within a kilometer of anything else so

129
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Potentially might

130
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
Crash into some

131
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
He will send us

132
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,103
Email we have an email system

133
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
It says watch out Planet Money

134
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
You might want to move your stuff

135
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:43,039
These emails are a free service of the US government don't say they never gave you anything

136
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:48,415
They send them to satellite owners all around the world anytime a satellite comes close to another satellite

137
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
Which is amazing

138
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,767
But they're trying to avoid an incident like the one that happened

139
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
In 2009

140
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
The infamous iridium Cosmo

141
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
Dead Russian satellite called

142
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
Cosmos 2251

143
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,007
Collided with a communication satellite iridium

144
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
33

145
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
And we don't know

146
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
Animated sound

147
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
We don't know what

148
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
The Collision look like

149
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
But Jace box.

150
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
On the screen

151
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
And from their point of view was frightening

152
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
Self

153
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
Are radars actually

154
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
He said

155
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:23,743
It should be one object here and one object there but now it appears to be hundreds of different objects

156
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
No

157
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,423
Knowing that collided it created hundreds of little bit of salad overall created to thaw

158
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
Thousand pieces of debris

159
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,519
I'm which we still all track

160
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
To this day

161
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Every little bit

162
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:42,943
Yeah well I mean some of the Kaden re-entered but we stay together as a little cloud or no

163
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
They disperse

164
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
When they come close to other satellites

165
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,087
So we're constantly tracking these p

166
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,903
Pieces of debris and now they're actually causing

167
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
Close approaches with other satellites

168
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Still

169
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,511
What 8 years later

170
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
This is bring up my holes

171
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Space junk

172
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
Anxiety problem

173
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:06,751
Yes it would be terrible for pod1 to go down in infamy by smashing into the International Space Station

174
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Always bad

175
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,079
But Jesus tells us that space is

176
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
Much bigger than

177
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
We can conceive

178
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,687
There are tens of thousands of objects up there

179
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
But there's still plenty of room

180
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
We have a clear path

181
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Fingers crossed

182
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
Alright G-spot

183
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Check

184
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
We have one more stop before lunch

185
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,695
It is a golf course owned by the military base

186
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
Really use it for that anymore

187
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
They use it for

188
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
Parties like this one

189
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:35,935
There's one of those big white wedding tents all set up there is

190
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Taco truck

191
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,287
And a selfie station took a picture with a model of satellite and

192
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Cosby dead

193
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
There's a nice

194
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Buffet

195
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:47,199
This is where the folks from planet are Partners satellite company have come to set up shop

196
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,271
We had to confirm all the scheduling pieces of today with planet

197
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
Did you technically own our satellite

198
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,927
Should be upfront about that and they will be doing all of the maneuvering

199
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,535
One spot one in space nobody wants to let a podcast Sierra satellite

200
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
Not a chance

201
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
We don't even

202
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
Really know what's going to happen to

203
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,959
The co-founder and the CEO of the company will Marshall was there

204
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
We asked him to

205
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,031
Where where exactly was a rocket go

206
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
Hopefully many app

207
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,407
Maybe I'll be over there around the Earth

208
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
You to make it simple for the podcast

209
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
We appreciate it

210
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
Will is an old hand at this this is planet

211
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
20th launch

212
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,391
Live roughly 200 small satellites in orbit

213
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
So many satellites

214
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
Did they usually

215
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Do not have a party

216
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
Do not have a buffet or selfie stick

217
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,863
But this was so close to their San Francisco office that they brought in everything

218
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,679
In about an hour will is going to give a short speech

219
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,471
Just like at a wedding

220
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
But unlike at a wedding hopefully

221
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
Will is going to

222
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Warren every

223
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,151
The day could end in failure and disaster

224
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
Loans can get delayed

225
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
That happens quite a lot so

226
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
Bed with us if it gets the light on

227
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
Occasionally they blow up

228
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,927
And that's why I'm fortunate crossing over the work that we put into a satellite

229
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
You said it to the party because we have to be remember that if that happens we go

230
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Backup

231
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
Next

232
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
Launches coming up in

233
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
Hemomancer

234
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
Fat people fat butt

235
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
Generally it's

236
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,127
It's okay just about having fun and watching the launch it is successful it'll be a really really fun

237
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,735
I have to say I've been impressed with how comfortable will

238
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
And everyone at planet is weak

239
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Is concept

240
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,903
Back in the old days when NASA was the only game in town I mean obviously

241
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Nobody wanted to take a risk

242
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,511
Human beings on board billion-dollar spacecraft

243
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
But the advantage of the

244
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Small sad

245
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
Annies cheaper Rockets

246
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
Is elasticsearch

247
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Lower

248
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
You can pick more chance

249
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
You can try new technology

250
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
You can invent things faster

251
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
If something goes wrong

252
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Will says

253
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
You just try again

254
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
And we ask Will how we will know if

255
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,175
This risk if

256
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
Pod1 made it to space for Mission with six

257
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,319
And he gives us these magic words to listen for on Milwaukee

258
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,207
Normally we pop the champagne when we get confirmation that they were successfully injected into orbit

259
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,559
And what did he say if it's successful

260
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
Set Side light decoration

261
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
Satellite separation

262
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
Then pod1 will be

263
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
Free of the Earth

264
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
Friv the rocket

265
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
And finally out on phone

266
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,591
We would love to stay and hear will speech

267
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
And possibly

268
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
Check out the taco truck because

269
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Very delicious

270
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
But we were offered a chance to get closer to the wall

271
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
Fatso

272
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
This is it

273
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
It's finally happening

274
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
A rocket is going up

275
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
In about 90 minutes

276
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,207
We drove to the meeting spot on the other side of the Earth

277
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,863
We got on this old school bus and were driven miles into the most remote part of the base 2

278
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:50,751
A little patch of dirt and scrub brush

279
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
We can't see The Rock

280
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
But they tell us it is just over there

281
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:04,319
They're just a few people here Military Officers photographers people from the rocket company orbital ATK

282
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
People like John steinmeier

283
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
Lily Pad is evacuated

284
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
For at least a couple of miles away where

285
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
Probably about as close as anyone

286
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
At the site here

287
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
You may remember John from our Ferry

288
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
First episode

289
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,959
He stands next to us helping us decode the launch chatter

290
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
It comes over this walkie-talkie

291
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,711
Nominal is this our favorite word

292
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
Everything is okay

293
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
Nominal

294
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
I think the most sort of

295
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,927
Call if there's a word that is calmer than nominal I've never heard it

296
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,999
So someone says it is non nominal

297
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
Probably off nominal

298
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
Domino's

299
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
Previous run

300
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
Centos not not nominal

301
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,055
It's all funny jokes until we get within a couple minutes

302
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
Then

303
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
Suddenly

304
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Everyone gets

305
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
Really quiet

306
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
They said T-minus

307
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
I don't know why it was whisper

308
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:13,439
We're Whispering because it's very serious and tents at the launch site and we're getting all of this

309
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:18,559
Very critical information at a very low volume over like a circus 1985 walkie-talkie

310
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
Did you give us one final

311
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
They said listen do not be alarmed

312
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
When you don't

313
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
Cure

314
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
The rocket

315
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,567
The rocket is apparently so far away that we will see it first

316
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
And then the sound will wash over

317
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
I have this weird feeling

318
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,223
Like when you're in a chair and you tilt back

319
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
And you're

320
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,575
About to fall and you pull yourself back its fat level

321
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Of like beer

322
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
In anticipation

323
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,975
And I find myself hoping that whatever happened to the space business

324
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
This moment

325
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
Never changes

326
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Or hear anything

327
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,687
What was surprised

328
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
Oh my gosh

329
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:14,623
Or shoot up so fast you can barely stare at it oh my God

330
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,023
It's hard to look at it

331
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,423
Vehicle

332
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,223
Successful

333
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,343
This was a really strange moment when I was standing there holding a bottle of champagne

334
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
We just watched a rocket

335
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,207
Shoot into the sky it seems like everything has gone well but

336
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
Everyone is standing around walkie-talkie

337
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,303
Staring at the ground

338
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Looking like

339
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Jet Li series

340
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,495
Because it's not about the rocket everyone's waiting to hear about the

341
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
Satellite that's what everyone here paid for

342
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
It's the most crucial part of the mission

343
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
Everybody's waiting every piece of crowded around that walkie-talkie

344
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,671
Sore falling along with this trying to search a picture

345
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
What is happening right now in space

346
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
And then

347
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
That calm voice say something

348
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Pretty tariff

349
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:38,335
Negative

350
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,919
That means it must contact

351
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
I think

352
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Negative

353
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,087
Telemetry so we can't see the rocket anymore it's

354
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Gone

355
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,159
Do the clouds in the atmosphere somewhere and

356
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,791
Apparently it has stopped sending data back to Mission Control it's not communicating with Mission Control anymore

357
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
It is stopped sending data back to

358
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Need to know what's going on

359
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
For some reason I just keep looking up

360
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
To the sky like I'm going to

361
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
See something before they do

362
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,615
Can we have negative

363
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
It is so quiet

364
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
And you can feel the tension in the air

365
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
And then

366
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:26,719
Coin counter

367
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,791
Are we are we in the clear

368
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
I literally thought I was going to throw up

369
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Well that would happen

370
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:38,495
I was already writing the end of the series in my mind and it was not a happy and

371
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
But even if we can understand

372
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
What number is the man said

373
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
It's clear that everything is

374
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
Back on track perfectly normal

375
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,479
The covering at the top of the rocket has opened up

376
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,831
And at this point we're just listening for any mention of the Planet Money

377
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
Satellite pod one

378
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,439
They do not call it by the name pod1

379
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,999
The nickname on the watch chatter is dove

380
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
And so

381
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,607
The greatest moment in Planet Money history

382
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Almost

383
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
Just goes by us

384
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
It's so quick

385
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,263
1 + 3

386
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
That's it

387
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
All right

388
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
Other people paid the money other people did the work

389
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
The Wii

390
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
We did the reporting cheers

391
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
It must have been the good luck pancakes

392
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Well we did it

393
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Somewhere up

394
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
Above the Earth

395
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
Is a cube satellite with our name on it

396
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
It's a Planet Money Pod 1

397
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
And there's a wave

398
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,495
Form of our voices on the side

399
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
And if you could read it

400
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
In space where that would be it would say

401
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Hello and welcome

402
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Planet Money

403
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,223
The Planet Money satellite is official it is now circling me

404
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
Are producer Elizabeth kulas

405
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
Has been holding

406
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
The microphone

407
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
This whole time

408
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,415
Do this incredibly tense moment

409
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,719
Recording everything not saying a word

410
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,375
And now you can tell she is a little bit choked up

411
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,519
People I know he started crying really sorry I couldn't believe the human Ingenuity could be so

412
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
I get to stand here

413
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
All day looking at the sky

414
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,735
Think about what it just happened

415
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
But

416
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
This is a military base and they are already checking their watches and

417
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,647
Pointing to the boss and being like Planet Money

418
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
Time to go

419
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,231
Don't We Gather for microphones and plastic champagne glasses

420
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,071
Hello Kitty bags and our Newfound knowledge of space lingo

421
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,607
It's been a nominal day

422
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
Extremely nominal day

423
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
And we walked back to the school bus

424
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
At home

425
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
Meanwhile

426
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
300 miles above our heads

427
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
A satellite is born

428
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
And not a soul can see

429
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
90 minutes after launch

430
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
HUD-1 make

431
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
First full orbit of the Earth

432
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
It went over the North Pole

433
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
17000 miles per hour

434
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
At this point it's just a spinning box

435
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
Picture of a loaf of bread

436
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
Tumbling through the sky

437
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,119
But somewhere in the first few hours

438
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
Speaks for the first time

439
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
It's just a pain that says

440
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
I'm here

441
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
I'm alive

442
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,103
Over the next couple of weeks the computers that control pod one try to stabilize the crash

443
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:29,503
There are these little wheels that spin inside of a satellite and each time you change the spin it nudges the saddle

444
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
By mid November

445
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
Pod one is stable

446
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
And it's solar panels have unfold

447
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,719
It is a camera now and it is pointed down at

448
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,535
And just this week just in time to finish the series

449
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
We get a call from

450
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
Are satellites has taken its first

451
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
This moment

452
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,447
It's called First Light

453
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Light

454
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
We are so excited

455
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
Took a while to set up a conference call

456
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,919
I'm now showing at Echo again okay

457
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Is that because

458
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
Technology

459
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,039
You know we can

460
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,623
Can send a satellite to space right

461
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,975
Okay so Stacy Mike has sent us an email here with a batch

462
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Photos

463
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,791
Up here

464
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
It's beer

465
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,887
This is the first thing that pod one ever saw

466
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
Oh my god there it is

467
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
Blue and white

468
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,055
Images

469
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,871
Who has collected over Northeastern Russia

470
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,687
Like Siberia sakhalin

471
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
So somewhere under those clouds

472
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Yeah

473
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
Yeah and in those are just

474
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
The first

475
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,623
Crappy photos first Pancake

476
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,159
Does it does get better luck

477
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:44,255
The next image is in North Korea

478
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,535
Everyone's favorite

479
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Place to

480
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,911
Azim around them have your satellite oh no way

481
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
North Korea

482
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
I've always wanted to see North

483
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
Create and there it is

484
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
I think that is

485
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
A Runway

486
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,407
NEC mountains in NC this

487
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,527
This road here in some buildings in a big river there are little tiny boats on the river

488
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,391
Where hasn't it's already see more of the world than I thought

489
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,999
We can see it all I feel like this is a crochet

490
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,327
But the earth looks really beautiful from 300 miles up

491
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,631
It's really extraordinary to see the world in

492
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
I've seen a lot of photos from space

493
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
But these feel personal

494
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
It's like when you're

495
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
Toddler

496
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
Draw Surfer

497
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,359
But I better check with Mike Mike

498
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
How do these photos compared with

499
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
The other satellites

500
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
This is pretty good

501
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,575
Quite pleased with Edwin performance

502
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,623
I feel like I knew part 1 was

503
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
What is the people that work at Planet

504
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,279
They said one of the things they enjoyed about this Siri

505
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,703
Was to see people excited about satellites again I mean to have almost 200 of them and Mike was telling me

506
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
He just

507
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Sort of thinks of it is at

508
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
A cloud of satellites

509
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
Inata

510
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,127
Not alike a single miraculous thing

511
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
I think that

512
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,479
It's in some ways I think about it

513
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,063
Commercial air travel big deal

514
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
When an airplane with

515
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
Flying

516
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,440
And now it's kind of like a man

517
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
Got to get to New York and I think

518
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
20 minutes late

519
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
It's a sign of progress

520
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,936
I don't know how to feel about that I know that's progress but it's kind of stupid

521
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
Well

522
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
I know what you mean I don't even

523
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,408
I don't want to end this whole thing in sad way give me give me an inspirational way for us to end

524
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,832
You have a satellite in space there's nothing to be sad about it is zooming around taking pictures of everywhere and

525
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Imaginable

526
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
The satellite

527
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Satellite

528
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Hit the satellite

529
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,144

537
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:36,800
For sticking with us through our space mission I sort of felt like we were doing it on behalf of all of you so please

We have been getting all of your emails about a possible future mission for pod1

540
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112
And we will have a follow-up episode in a few months

541
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,696
Where we use our satellite to hopefully change the world

542
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,976
For the better

543
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,048
Didn't say that

544
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:04,960
Today's episode was produced by the wonderful Elizabeth who produced the entire space series and made it happen

545
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:11,360
Alex goldmark azar supervising producer and brian dorsett is our editor

546
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
To Michael stonecipher out of Vandenberg

547
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:19,552
Air Force Base who kept us on time and on Mission and a special special thing

548
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,368
To Trevor Hammond and all the people

549
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
At Planet

550
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,696
Who believed in US

551
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
A satellite

552
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,024
One of their companies missions is

553
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
2

554
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:34,144
Teach people about the world to make the world a smaller better place

555
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:40,544
And they were fantastic and allowing us humans view inside the small satellite industry we would never have done

556
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
Otherwise

Thing that ever went to space

581
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008

And we are here with a new show the indicator

589
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,816
It's 3 days a week about 5 minutes for show and it is from the people who make Planet Money mostly about work

590
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,096
Business and the economy

591
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:14,496
On every show we take some number in the news or term or a story and we died

592
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,544
Intuit to find the big idea behind it

593
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,944
And we really hope is it an every show but look at least almost every show will bring you a new idea

00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:28,576
Some new lens through which to see the world indicator Planet Money
