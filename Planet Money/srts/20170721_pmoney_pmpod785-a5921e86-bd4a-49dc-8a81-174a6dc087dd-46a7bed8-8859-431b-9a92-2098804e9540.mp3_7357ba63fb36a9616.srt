00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:47,872
As I speak

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,200

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,248
Basketball sneaker history

Today on the show we know that you can put a famous basketball players name on a pair of shoes and charge more money

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,792
But what happens when you put an NBA All-Stars name on a pair of shoes and charge less

20
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,912
Much much less but like

21
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,984

The Man Behind the sneakers that I'm wearing

29
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,288
Is an NBA All-Star Game Stephon Marbury

30
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,848
And he grew up during the basketball sneaker Revel

31
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,944
You go your mom and you would you say I'm playing basketball I need

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,016
The sneakers I said I want

33
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,856
Important distinction here of course especially with my mother

34
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:07,744
Gwen Stefani was born in 1977 basketball shoes were essentially just a piece of sports equipment

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
Like knee pads for your

36
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
The most iconic brand for decades

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
It was a shoe called

38
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
Chuck Taylor All Star

39
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,216
Basic affordable Shoes Canvas rubber nothing fancy

40
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,520
But when Stephon with 8 years old

41
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
The sneaker game

42
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
Change

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
In 1985 Nike release this commercial is Michael Jordan

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
Soaring in slow motion through the air

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Air Jordan with the first Air Jordan sneaker and it was beautiful and look like a sports car white and black leather with

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
Streaks of red

47
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
Stores couldn't keep these things in stock

48
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,680
People wearing them has shoes not just as basketball shoes

49
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
And they cost a lot

50
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,288
The Air Jordan 1 retail for $65

51
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
150 bucks

52
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
In today's money

53
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,504
And then the next year 1986 Air Jordan The Jordan 2 came out all of the Imagine

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,576
Those hot even more $100

55
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,160
The Jordan fours cost 210 the Jordan 5s cost

56
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,952
$125

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
Stefan was 13 years old when those Jordan 5

58
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
About his living in Coney Island Brooklyn

59
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,608
One of seven kids

60
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
His family didn't have a lot

61
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
And so

62
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,472
When Stefan asked his mom for those shoes

63
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
She was not happy

64
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
I mean my mother I asked my mother

65
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
Look for a pair of shoes at that price

66
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
The reply was

67
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,688
Boy those are groceries for the month

68
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,248
Why am I going to go spend that type of money

69
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
For a pair of shoes

70
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
And you would say what

71
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
Cuz everybody else got them

72
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,464
Oh yeah you're not going to be the one that's going to have a pet

73
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,048
But it wasn't because she didn't want to buy them if

74
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
Because she couldn't

75
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,400
Define says this planted a seed

76
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
He always wondered

77
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
When there be another option here

78
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,080
Does a famous players basketball shoe always have to be so expensive

79
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
No lot of kids my

80
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
Think this but

81
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,456
Stephan got to do something about it

82
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Because

83
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,272
He grew up he got very good at basketball

84
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,344
In 1996 he was drafted into the end

85
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,184
With the first pick the Milwaukee Bucks

86
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Select

87
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:20,607
Stephon Marbury the camera cuts to the whole Margaery family they are freaking out

88
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:27,007
Stephon Marbury is standing by now with brexit

89
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
Is this moment right here

90
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
That makes me love step on Mars

91
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:34,431
Because on the first question was totally just sounds like an ice breaker

92
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
She disturbed

93
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
20 login

94
00:04:53,887 --> 00:05:00,031
Can talk about your family what is it been like the camera cuts that stayed and now Stefan's mother is

95
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:05,151
Dancing is just feels so good I can put a smile on my mother face

96
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
Define join the NBA

97
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
Became an NBA All-Star twice

98
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,111
And year after year famous player after famous player

99
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,695
Signed endorsement deals to sell shoes at ridiculously high

100
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
Safari doesn't remember the exact moment

101
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
But an idea started

102
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
You can think of it this way

103
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,423
Sneaker is made up of foam and rubber and leather

104
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
By attaching a famous basketball players name

105
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
Can you get to charge more

106
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
And kids go crazy for

107
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
Could you use an endorsement to do the

108
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Exact opposite

109
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,711
Topeka same shoe of foam and rubber and leather

110
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
And attach a famous basketball players name

111
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
But charged

112
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
Less

113
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
And still have it be cool still get the kind of buzz the Air Jordan

114
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
Stephan wanted to know

115
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Could I

116
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
Make affordable sneakers

117
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Cool

118
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
I can see my mom

119
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,911
I can see my mom being able to do something for all of her kids

120
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
Suzette is that who you pick

121
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Picture windows

122
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Of course

123
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,615
In 2005 after he been in the NBA for almost a decade

124
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,199
The phone finally met someone who could help him make this

125
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
A guy named Howard

126
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
Schecter

127
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
He's always talked about there has to be a different way well

128
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
We were the different way

129
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,511
Howard work for a clothing company called Steve & Barry's founded by a pair of long Islanders named Steve

130
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Amberry

131
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,583
It was a relatively unknown chain

132
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,399
That's sold clothes at ridiculously low

133
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,703
Prices and they said they were able to do this

134
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
A couple of ways

135
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,335
For one they cut out the middleman they manufacture Their Own Line of clothes in China

136
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,639
They took the smallest markup

137
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
But they could possibly

138
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Afford

139
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,247
They basically had no advertising budget

140
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,319
And then they open stores in struggling malls where they would

141
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Ask for

142
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Discount

143
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Free space

144
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
This was a business mod

145
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
But now

146
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Steve & Barry's

147
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
Wanted to get in

148
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
To be athletic sneaker

149
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,375
Howard personally had a vision for cheap basketball shoes

150
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,447
And he wanted to have a famous basketball player

151
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
People have told him that Stephon Marbury

152
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,079
Happened to be a famous basketball player

153
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Looking

154
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
To make shoes cheaper

155
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,479
There was just like a light bulb went off and they said you know staff

156
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
Could be the perfect

157
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Athlete

158
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,367
So where gets the stuff on that Steve & Barry's would like to me

159
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
And his first thought

160
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
Who and who

161
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,327
I didn't know I mean I learned of them before the meeting and I was like this is

162
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,375
You know I got to see this for myself

163
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
Justified took this meeting

164
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,495
And he remember Steven berries laying out their vision for the sneaker

165
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
They're going to call at the star berry

166
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,591
That's been Stefan's nicknames in high school

167
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
And they had brought some prototype

168
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,455
Plus some clothes that would be part of the star berryline

169
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
They start showing me and you know

170
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,087
The stuff that we're making the quality is really good that is

171
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
I'm saying

172
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
OK Google I was like how much is all that how much

173
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
It's like $15

174
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,767
You're going to make all that stuff

175
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
$15

176
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
Damn

177
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
And then he

178
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
No we're going to sell all this stuff

179
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,215
All the stuff you see is going to be $15 or less

180
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
I said

181
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
T okay

182
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Like I

183
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,335
And it was like no serious

184
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
For real

185
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
And then I was like

186
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:21,503
Do you telling me you can make all of these different things and you can sell everything under $15

187
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Let's do this deal

188
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
Now there are two ways

189
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
To think about it.

190
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
The obvious one is it

191
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
You want to go out

192
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,327
And find the most famous the biggest like the best

193
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Person and attach them to your product

194
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,703
At this point in his career Stephon Marbury wasn't

195
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
Really any of those the

196
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,103
But the other way of thinking of endorsements is it if you have the right product

197
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
In the right person

198
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
In a story is

199
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
Perfect

200
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,271
Then maybe you don't have to be the most famous person in the world

201
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,599
So yeah there's a place for the Air Jordan where you have the most

202
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,183
Famous basketball player matched up with the most expensive most elite

203
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
Shoe

204
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,023
But maybe there's also a place for the star berry

205
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,839
Where you have a less famous basketball player

206
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,423
Who has a great story about how he couldn't afford those shoes

207
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
But now

208
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
He's matched up with a v

209
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
$18

210
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
On August 17th

211
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
2006

212
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
The shudra

213
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
The strawberry one went on sale

214
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
Exclusively

215
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
@steven Berry

216
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:30,879
Another basketball star is lending his name to a new sneakers

217
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,463
At a low cost is starbury one basketball shoes

218
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,839
$14.98 for low income families

219
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
The story was everywhere

220
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
And so is Stefan

221
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,679
Showing off

222
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359
Strawberry one is a mostly white shoe it has dark veins of blue cutting across the upper that's the part that goes

223
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
Over the top of your foot

224
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
The sole of the shoe with New York Knicks Orange

225
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
The Team Stefan with playing

226
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
I'm

227
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
People seemed

228
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Excited to see it

229
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
But

230
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Over and over

231
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Same question

232
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:11,327
One question I might ask is are you cutting Corners at the production and cuz that's a sensitive issue everybody thought

233
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
If this cost $15

234
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
It cannot possibly

235
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Be a good bass

236
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
I'm Good Morning America Diane Sawyer was worried about the bottom of the shoe

237
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:28,223
Basketball in here Jimmy Kimmel show the picture of Stephan holding up a shoe that look like

238
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
Someone had pulled it out of

239
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:34,367
Dumpster $15

240
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
Price signaling

241
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Problem

242
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:41,023
In the marketing and Retail World prices communicate so much information

243
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
Especially

244
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,863
In an aspirational market like Athletics so

245
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,959
When you go out and you buy a new golf club for a little bit more money you're hoping

246
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,823
But that is going to buy you performance like maybe your drive will be 10 yards longer

247
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,199
And so pricing the star berry at $14.98

248
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
Had unintentionally signal to that this sneaker

249
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Is crap

250
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:09,439
The Fancy Shoes are ten times more money does that mean that they are 10 times better does that mean

251
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
That the star berry is

252
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
10 *

253
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Worse

254
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,559
See Premier the shuo

255
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
I forgot that so before we talked I went on eBay

256
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
The price signaling problem

257
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
Dominated the starburys

258
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
And what's the phone kept saying was

259
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,895
If people would just try these things out they would see that these are not

260
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
10 * 1

261
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,247
To be shoes for 10 years old I bought these on eBay they're my size

262
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
I'ma put you through the wringer man

263
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,063
I'm a play

264
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
Play games on it

265
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,927
I might try to run a half marathon time prediction is that they're going to hold up

266
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,719
You going to run a half marathon

267
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
Try try having

268
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,559
I haven't trained for it you good

269
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
Okay

270
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
On The Go baby go for it go for it

271
00:11:53,983 --> 00:12:00,127
Don't breathe well but not the problem I am the problem

272
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,735
6.55

273
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,831
Terrible idea she was hella fine

274
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,159
They also actually held up really well running and cutting on a basketball court

275
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:17,535
But listen these are not the exact same as $150 pair of

276
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,839
Many of the differences are just cosmetic

277
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
It looks very simple the laces aren't

278
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,263
Fancy and I suspect the leather upper is actually pleather although I've never gotten a straight answer on that

279
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,615
But there are things that seem more important like there's no match for breathing there's no air bubble in the

280
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
High heel

281
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
That said

282
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,223
It is way closer to an expensive shoe than I expect

283
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
And so when the shoe came out

284
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
The goal was

285
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
To get people to try it and have the same experience

286
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
I had stuff on went on

287
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
Interview after interview

288
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
Trying to convince people just give it a chance

289
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,559
My favorite way that Stephon did this

290
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
What's he tried

291
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
I tried so hard

292
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
To just get someone to take a star berry

293
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
To take an expensive shoe and to do an analysis

294
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
My chopping them both in half

295
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,127
If you take a $200 shoe and you take my shoe when you cut both of the shoes down

296
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
Got a motor with a chainsaw

297
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
Over and over

298
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
You took both of the shoes you took a sword

299
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
Cut both of them down the middle

300
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,879
And then finally someone actually took Stephan up on this

301
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,439
Cut it down to half and to do the same exact

302
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Really

303
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:23,071
It was John Stossel on 20/20 actually took a pair of Jordans and a pair of starburys

304
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
Sneaker X

305
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
So he cut both shoes up

306
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
And he and others in the business

307
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,079
Concluded are constructed the same way your Jordans do have this thing that looks like an air vent but

308
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
It's closed

309
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:40,735
I actually talked to the guy who is in charge of Designing Air Jordans at the time a sneaker Legend

310
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
Name Dewayne Edward

311
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,111
Oh yeah we bought a pair just to see cuz we were curious to like how they pull this off

312
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,951
Andy Wayne said Yeah we actually chop the pair of them open to

313
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,815
It was about the bare minimum you need to build a basketball shoe he wouldn't go play in

314
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
But that said

315
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
Is it better

316
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
Then you would expect a $15 in

317
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
It was

318
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
It was obviously no actually

319
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
People cutting shoe open

320
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Great

321
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
But Howard Shack

322
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,383
You're from Steven berries

323
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,687
It says that both he and Stefan new

324
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
There's really only one

325
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
Test adult

326
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
Can an NBA player

327
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
Where these $15 shoes

328
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
In a real

329
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
NBA game

330
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,511
It is very easy to rip a $50 anything

331
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Yeah

332
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
But if an NBA player

333
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
Kenan Trust

334
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Their bodies

335
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Tilly's

336
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
Gotta be good enough

337
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
It's got to be good and

338
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,775
The shoe launched in the summer during the autopsy

339
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
People had months to speculate

340
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,383
About whether the shoe could hold up or not

341
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
And then on November 1st

342
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
2006

343
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
The day arrived

344
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
The first game of the Seas

345
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
New York Knicks

346
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
Versus the Memphis

347
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:54,719
The opening tip your Stefan wearing the black version of the starberry the version he wore for away games

348
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
Howard sheckter remembers watch

349
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,119
Enormous Pride every time they showed up and you saw that logo

350
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
We

351
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,215
Chilitos little company nobody ever heard of

352
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
We we made it we got this NBA star is wearing the sneaker we thought about on

353
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Concord the game was going great it was

354
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
The third quarter

355
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
Stefan and the Knicks were leading by nine

356
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
And then

357
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
All of a sudden

358
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
I think Steph trip

359
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,463
Or something

360
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Imma

361
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,863
I'm thinking it better not been the shoe remember he's playing in those reduced

362
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
Price shoes

363
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,959
But the wind is knocked out of me like

364
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
God forbid

365
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
The shoe ripped on court

366
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,127
Or it didn't hold the traction any any slipped in

367
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Tours near something

368
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
You know

369
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
It's done

370
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
Stephon goes over to the bench

371
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
The game goes on without him

372
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
And somebody rushes over to look at his foot

373
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,415
And everyone is like oh my god let's hope it wasn't the shoes fault

374
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Like like like

375
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,999
We don't know talking about

376
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,071
Define was totally fine he gotten kicked in the shin or some

377
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
Came back into the game

378
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,399
And honestly he doesn't even remember it

379
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
You know this is Sparta basketball

380
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
When the next game came

381
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Stefan

382
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,847
Weather $15 shoe again

383
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
And then the next game and the next game

384
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
Where the entire season Stephon Marbury

385
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
War 1/5

386
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
King Dollar

387
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Sneaker

388
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831
Sales of the star berry

389
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Tok off

390
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,695
Steven Berry's expanded the line Beyond just the basketball sneaker

391
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,743
And in total over the next year-and-a-half

392
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,095
They sold 4 million pairs of starbury sneakers

393
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Insta font

394
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
For his part

395
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Sperm Durante

396
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,239
Million dollars in royalties off of clothes

397
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
And shoes

398
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,847
Duffy's Bar not Air Jordan numbers but remember they didn't have to

399
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,919
Because Stefan was making affordable shoes

400
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Fat people

401
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Wanted

402
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,503
And he was making money

403
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,783
The experiment

404
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,343
What's a success it had worked

405
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,927
Sofantex the point of this one moment in

406
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
Particular that sums the supper

407
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,767
It's from one of his store appearances in his ex

408
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
When is a little kid

409
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,887
He shopping with his mom

410
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:16,287
And he's picking out all of these clothes and then he just goes and he walks to the camera he said

411
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,591
I'm living in a dream

412
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
How many me

413
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
I'm in a dream

414
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Veteran

415
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
It did not last

416
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Forever

417
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
Because in 2008

418
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
The financial

419
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Crisis-hit

420
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Howard schachter

421
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,671
So that hit Steven berries

422
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
Retailers

423
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,767
That work on thin margin

424
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,583
Rely heavily on the credit markets

425
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,191
To give them a line of credit in which to go out and buy inventory

426
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,775
And then you saw that inventory and pay back the bank and

427
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
And keep going

428
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,591
But credit lines

429
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Froze up

430
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
And Steven Berry's filed for bankruptcy

431
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
Without the store

432
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
The $15 sneaker experiment

433
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,295
Steven berries was the

434
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,367
Exclusive provider of the sneaker and they were the ones

435
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
Handling the manufacturer

436
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
Those with their connect

437
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
Those were my connection

438
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,559
Other things were also going badly for stuff on it

439
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
His father had died tragic

440
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
Is basketball team was struggling

441
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
And he was getting blamed

442
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
M4a Plus

443
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
He wanted Young

444
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,823
And so in 2009 he decided

445
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
Was time to move on

446
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
Stefan left the NBA

447
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
And you left the starbury sneaker experiment behind

448
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
But then

449
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,551
Stephon Marbury resurrect

450
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
Did his career

451
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,927
In the one place that might still give his sneaker dream

452
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
A chance

453
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Niihau

454
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
Washu ma bully

455

456
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
Stephon Marbury

457
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:49,471

467
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:16,095
In 2010 after Stephon Marbury had left the NBA he went to play professional basketball in

468
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
In China

469
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,935
After a couple years he landed on the Beijing ducks

470
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,239
Hey beloved perennial Underdog

471
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
They had never won

472
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
So we go we went 13 games in a row

473
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Out the gate

474
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,919
Stephon Marbury led the Beijing ducks to a

475
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
First championship

476
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
And then another

477
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
And then another

478
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,111
He has since become one of the most famous basketball players

479
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
In Chinese basketball history

480
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,487
It's like a whole new life baby I can't tell you no lie

481
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,767
It's the truth

482
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,327
Statues Museum

483
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,911
Am I mistaken there's like a musical also did a musical

484
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,495
Either play

485
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,847
The Vice news organization actually went and recorded this play

486
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,599
Stefan is now very well connected in China

487
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
The global capital

488
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
Of sneaker manufacturer

489
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
And of course basketball players

490
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,535
Are still putting a names on basketball sneakers

491
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
And charging an absurd amount

492
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
And so Stefan

493
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,911
Has decided it is time

494
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,703
To bring back the star bear

495
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
A solid

496
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,287
Affordable basketball shoe with his name on

497
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,383
Is currently a limited run of starburys available online

498
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
They're ramping up production now

499
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
And Stefan will still sell

500
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
A $15 Bass

501
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,087
Can you still make and sell basketball sneakers

502
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
For $15

503
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
That you could

504
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,159
Play basketball in

505
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
Yes you can

506
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
The fappening

507
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
It is happening

508
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
Excited I'm very excited

509
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,143
Cuz I want all the little kids to be happy when they playing on the court

510
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
Fresh Pig cakes

511
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,983
You understand that's what it's really about

512
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
This time around though

513
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
He's also going to be selling some higher-end

514
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
Although

515
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,383
The fun higher-end means

516
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,151
50 bucks

517
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
60

518
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,735
The shoes will mostly be sold online

519
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,807
But there is a plan to have a couple of flagship store

520
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,416
One in Brooklyn possibly Coney Island the neighborhood where Stephon grew up

521
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,440
The other one

522
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
In Stefan's new home

523
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,000
