1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,304
They say that money makes the world go round

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,096
Let's be more specific

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,888
It is actually the US

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,704
Dollar a French wine exporter

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,520
You need to lay in Oak for your wine barrels

6
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,800
You paying US dollar

7
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,336
If your Brazilian coffee maker

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,408
You want to sell your coffee to make drinks in Turkey

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
You get paid in US dollar

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,832
In every other country in the world every country that is not the United States there are basically two currencies

11
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
That matter

12
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,648
When to use at home with their friends

13
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,208
The Brazilian real to French Euro

14
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
In the one they used to trade

15
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,280
Which is the US dollar

16
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,816
And this is very

17
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
Very good

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
For the United States

19
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,656
Crucial really to our place in the world

20
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
Everyone wants our money

21
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,728
Everyone takes our money

22
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,800
And it's valuable to United States in all sorts of ways

23
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
What is when us businesses want to trade abroad

24
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
In u.s. dollars guess what

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,408
We already have

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,432
US dollar

27
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,736
And pretty complicated reasons it basically means

28
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
And when it comes to trade

29
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
The wind is at our back

30
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
But it wasn't always like this

31
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,112
There was a moment

32
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,160
Weirdest became the way we do business

33
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,232
The world got together in a rare display of

34
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,048
Global economic planning in decided

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,632
You need to cooperate and we need one currency

36
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
2 train

37
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,728
But exactly which currency would be was up for

38
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,544
Congrats to the fight between two men

39
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
1 British

00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
Kid is brilliant utopian dream of a common currency

44
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,344
The world give a guy the guy who ended up

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Winning

46
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,160
Despite almost no one knows his name

47
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
Harry Dexter White

48
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,840
Somehow he managed to outwit John Maynard Keynes and put the US dollar at the center of

49
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
The world

50
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,264

The song went down in the cool mountains of New Hampshire

73
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,264
We have near the Canadian border there is a giant hotel its Whitewood up on a ridge looks like a bee

74
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Cruise ship

75
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,080
And it is still open today

76
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,480
Good evening welcome to the Mount Washington hotel in Bretton Woods of course we had to go see it

77
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
I was checking in

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,832
Yes I do want to go to the reception desk right to the left

79
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,672
The town of Bretton Woods would become famous for what happened in this hotel

80
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
Was the end of World War II and the great economic minds of the world came together to figure out what's next

81
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:20,192
The newsreels of the time make it seem like a very sober and serious endeavor

82
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
At Bretton Woods New Hampshire delegates from 44 Allied and Associates countries arrived for the opening up the United

83
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
Monetary and financial conference

84
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,992
On the newsreel you can see dozens of men in their wool suit

85
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:36,064
Hats

86
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,624
The flooding into the ornate lobby of the Mount Washington

87
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,720
These meetings are designed to promote trade in the postwar world

88
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,792
How to create a foundation for a lasting peace

89
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,400
The delegates here would create these big Global organizations that exist to this day

90
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,472
The international monetary fund the World Bank

91
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,800
But the newsreels lead out the real story this hotel was

92
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
Off the beaten path

93
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,176
It was up in the woods and it was pretty chaotic inside

94
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
A lot of the real action

95
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
To place in the basement of the hotel

96
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
In a bar called the Moon Room

97
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
The owner of the hotel

98
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,416
Strolls down a lot first night so that the the moon Raymond

99
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
Just have a look around our guide is Ed Conway he's a reporter for Sky News and he's the author of the new book The Summit

100
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375
Representatives of almost every

101
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Country in the world

102
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,727
That before him drinking away

103
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
Enjoying themselves

104
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,335
And I think that was the sense that never before had this

105
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,639
This corner of New Hampshire

106
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Quite such a cosmopolitan

107
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
10 crowd

108
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,991
And the power of Ashen face

109
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
Still needed to be taken away

110
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
Because he was so shocked that the proceedings

111
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,647
I mean you sure about that more back in the day people used to faint

112
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
A lot more back then

113
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
When you picture Bretton Woods

114
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
Pictures

115
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Cigar

116
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
Whiskey

117
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
High levels of emotion

118
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,863
There episodes where even the canoe

119
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
The strongest men that

120
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,471
Burst into tears because it was entirely stressful

121
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
They were working

122
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
18 hour days

123
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
And on top of this

124
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Drinking

125
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Copious amounts of olive

126
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,151
I rarely read

127
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
Anything economics or otherwise any account

128
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
That has

129
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
So much about the amount

130
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
Booze that way

131
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Was conceived

132
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,879
Achieving a short period of time and that's

133
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
That was

134
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
One of the Fizz that that that

135
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
Canes have going into this

136
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Casey said that

137
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,071
Avoid alcohol poisoning was going to session before the end of it

138
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
There was a reason for so much out

139
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
Because the problem they were dealing with was huge

140
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
They were trying to put

141
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
World.

142
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,799
Even before the war the global economic system was broken

143
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
Countries that mostly stop trading with

144
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,663
First there was The Depression countries put up these

145
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
High trade barriers

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
To try to protect their domestic industries

147
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
And there was a bigger problem

148
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
The world had gone off

149
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
The gold standard

150
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,159
How did the gold standard every country's currency was backed by a

151
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
Precise amount of gold

152
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
You knew exactly what a French franc

153
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
Gore US dollar was worth

154
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,887
Gold me trading easy gold standard countries could print money and they did

155
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:04,287
It and the value of their currencies went badly up and down it was hard to trade when you never knew when any given day with the

156
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
Other guys currency

157
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
She was work

158
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,151
So this was the issue they're trying to solve at Bretton Woods

159
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
How do we stabilize the world currency

160
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
So people can start trading at

161
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
They're basically two ideas

162
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
To deal with this

163
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
Two pretty different ideas

164
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
To buried

165
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Different men

166
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
The first guy

167
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
John

168
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Maynard

169
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,791
He ride the Bretton Woods has the biggest celebrity Economist in the world

170
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
He had a long a

171
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,447
This kind of stuff you'd watch the world screw up the economic recovery after World War 1

172
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
Helpguide Britain

173
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Depression

174
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
The man is

175
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
Gregarious he's brilliant

176
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Magnetic

177
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
He's the one that's in all the photos

178
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,151
He's the one that talks in the newsreel

179
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,991
Who was the man

180
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
New Hampshire

181
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
And I doubt

Eye doctor

183
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
We are bringing in

184
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
I love that the bigger thing we are bringing

185
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,375
Even today when people think about Bretton Woods conference they think about John Maynard

186
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,727
Hurricanes when you're at the hotel everyone knows exactly what room you stayed in

187
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
We went to it room 219

188
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Still in use

189
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Hi

190
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,943
Economics reporters and this is the room that

191
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
Famous economist slept in

192
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
John Maynard Keynes

193
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
We're just wondering if we could look at it

194
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,391
Sorry to bother you

195
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,975
It's a beautiful room fireplace big bedroom looks out on the mount

196
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,791
I'm so waiting here this is where John Maynard

197
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Quintas wife

198
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
The Russian ballerina

199
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
You heard aunt

200
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
In Kansas

201
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
We know

202
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
That it was

203
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
Is this room because downstairs

204
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
Weber tried reset

205
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
Secretary morgenthau was trying to sleep

206
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
His wife Eleanor and they were getting mad

207
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
Kids ball the ballet X

208
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
Exercise is over

209
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
Bretton Woods was like a summer camp

210
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
You know if

211
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
If it's summer camp determine the

212
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
Future of the economy

213
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,647
It's like Dirty Dancing if John Maynard Keynes were there

214
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207
Nobody puts the British pound sterling

215
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
In a corner

216
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,791
Because Kansas walking into this

217
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
Worried about Britain

218
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Place in the world

219
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,911
When he grew up in Great Britain

220
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,983
It was a colonial power it ran the world economy

221
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
And now the best

222
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
He could hope for

223
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,359
Is a new currency system that does not put the American

224
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
He wants something where everyone's included

225
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,735
Frankly Britain is not bossed around by the night

226
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
Kinjaz rival is America

227
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
Harry Dexter White

228
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,183
He was actually the man running the conference and today everyone knows the room that

229
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
Teens

230
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
Stating no one has any idea where White

231
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,839
Stayed and even when he was alive he was an enigmatic

232
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
We did find a little archive

233
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
Representatives of 44 Nation

234
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
Bretton Woods

235
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,263
Steps to prevent a repetition

236
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,591
The currency chaos which is usually followed in the wake of War

237
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,991
Harry Dexter white was the assistant Secretary of the United States Treasury he's sort of wormed his way in there while

238
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
Kings was born an aristocrat

239
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,087
Wait was kind of from the wrong side of

240
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
The tracks

241
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
He had these immigrant parents his dad was

242
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Hardware Peddler

243
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,999
We've worked his way up from a temp in the treasury

244
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Department

245
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,863
And where teens was magnetic and Charming

246
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:14,239
What is about the most unlikeable character you will ever see even

247
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
His colleague

248
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
X4

249
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Meyerism

250
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Disability

251
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
Never had anything nice

252
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Say about

253
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
No one

254
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Says anything

255
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Nice

256
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
About him

257
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
Bent deals with the

258
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,903
The Council on Foreign Relations and she wrote a book about the two guys it's called The Battle of Bretton Woods

259
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,999
He says Harry Dexter White had been fantasizing about this conference

260
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,023
4 years

261
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Before it has

262
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,375
Who's time wait felt that America take its

263
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
Proper place as the leader of the world

264
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,239
While waiting caneswear maneuvering

265
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
Power behind the scenes

266
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:54,175
The rest of the representatives from all those other countries were having a final time arguing about global economics during the day

267
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
And partying late into

268
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
Like there was this one draft

269
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
Sherman went on to become a governor

270
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Central Bank

271
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,159
He made sure every evening to the

272
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Supply

273
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
15 minute recess

274
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,487
At 1:30 a.m.

275
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
So they were trying on

276
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Pretty evening

277
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
Is 1:30 a.m.

278
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,143
To enable and I quote to enable the members of the drafting

279
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
Including the chairman

280
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
The joint pain

281
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,799
Downstairs in the moon room and observe the titillating gyration

282
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,359
The Peruvian bombshell

283
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:30,783
Does refreshed and reinvigorated we were able to carry on with renewed vigor

284
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
For another hour

285
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Elmo

286
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,135
John Maynard Keynes allowed himself a little shampoo

287
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
But he was mostly careful

288
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
Get a bad heart

289
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
His wife was with him made him go to bed early

290
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,815
Harry Dexter white said he never slept for more than five

291
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
Hours cuz he was

292
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Working all the

293
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
Can you put pretty hard during the day because

294
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,983
You had this plan that you come up with before the conference

295
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,799
The even now seems amazingly audacious

296
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
To get countries to trade with each

297
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
Kane said what the world needs

298
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Is to create a new

299
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
International currency

300
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
To replace goal

301
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
Every Nation could still use their own money

302
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
Play inside the country

303
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
When a country traded it would use this

304
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
Brand new currency

305
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
The Brits even had a contest

306
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
To name it

307
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
Anniston Star

308
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Flooding into

309
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
The treasury you had

310
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,583
Suggestions like

311
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Traudel

312
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Unity Bank

313
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Bit

314
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,751
Hound all that

315
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Kansas

316
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
Favorites was old

317
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
I don't know why

318
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
But he really likes old

319
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
By the time you get up on the line.

320
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,391
A few times but then later on because I ran a note to his church recall eggs

321
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Do you think it's any use

322
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Detroit

323
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Unicorn

324
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Honorary

325
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,863
It is across much more picturesque and romantic and would have the advantage

326
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,703
Supplying a suitable Emblem three institutions notepaper

327
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
Ferno tissue should the course of evolution

328
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Have a bring them to

329
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
When kings actually drop his plan

330
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
There was no mention of eunuch

331
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
Can you call the new currency

332
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Bancor

333
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,503
Bancor

334
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
It's French

335
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
Bank gold

336
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Bancorp

337
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,135
And it was such a king's like idea right that

338
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,463
Governments could come up with something that was actually better than gold

339
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
Can I do with the same

340
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
When you trade with another country you would use

341
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Bancorp

342
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
And they would get Central Bank of the world

343
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
Keep track of all the Bancorp

344
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
And it would make sure that no one was

345
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
Exporting too much

346
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
Importing too much

347
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,335
It was utopian but it was also a little selfish for cane

348
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
Because his plan was to base this

349
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Global bank in London

350
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
And the new currency was better than gold for

351
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
The British because

352
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,063
Great Britain has sold most of its gold to fund the war

353
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
He was in their best interest

354
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
To create something new

355
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:47,743
So that was the Keene proposal and Harry Dexter White had a different idea

356
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,815
His big plan for the world also involve the kind of

357
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Universal currency

358
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
Not the Unicorn or the

359
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
Orb

360
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,471
He thought it should be the US

361
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Dollar

362
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
Harry Dexter white knows that the best way to ensure this is here at Bretton Woods if you could somehow get all of the

363
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
The new international rules

364
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
These countries were going to sign on to

365
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,295
To include the dollar amount than every country

366
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Cedar wood

367
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Dollars

368
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
Harry Dexter white drove

369
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Teens

370
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Nuts

371
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
White was always try to control everything

372
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,255
Typical American

373
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,327
He was trying to slip the dollar in and all these complicated ways

374
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
It Conway read us a quote from John Mayer

375
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
This is intolerable he said

376
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,007
We could simply better break off negotiations

377
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,383
Terry Dexter wait replied to Keynes we will try to better create something your highness

378
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Can under

379
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,479
This is how Harry Dexter white pulled off his little

380
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
He never openly suggested that World Trade should be based on the US dollar what he did instead was here in this UFO

381
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
Feminism in to all the

382
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,511
Numbers needed to talk about some form of international trade

383
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
He referred

384
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
2 gold convertible

385
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,191
As in every country on Earth should pick their currency to some unnamed

386
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
Gold convertible car

387
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
Of course what country

388
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,639
We had the gold the United States the US had 80% of the gold of the world

389
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
Ben Steele told this story

390
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
One of the committee

391
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Indian

392
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
Got fat

393
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,879
Ben said that it was high time that the Americans explain

394
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
What a gold convertible

395
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Currency was

396
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,999
At that point the British delegate

397
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Skins was on

398
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
Dealing with the World Bank

399
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
Dennis rabe

400
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Bella in Twilight

401
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
He thought that they would

402
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
Discussing a minor

403
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
Accounting issue and suggested that

404
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
Sake of clarity they might simply say

405
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
White thinking very much

406
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,991
And said that the matter would be referred to

407
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Technical

408
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
Harry Dexter White had

409
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
The green light.

410
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Heathen

411
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,415
Looking for Heatran this technical committee

412
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:57,535
The British suggestion that someone should just write in the word dollar he took that and ran with it

413
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,119
The technical committee stayed up all night going through the relevant documents

414
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,471
That night they went through the draft IMF articles of agreement

415
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
Ultimately 96

416
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Pages

417
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
And changed every reference

418
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
Constable convertible currency

419
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
TUS

420
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:18,271
The British author that we talked to a Conway he doesn't think it was quite this since turquoise

421
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
This much of an ass

422
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
But the result was

423
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:27,487
All the documents governing the new monetary system had the term US dollar written right

424
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
Kings didn't even know it was all happening

425
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
He was stuck in these meetings about the World Bank

426
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Making another part of the

427
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,215
Under the new agreement basically every country would have to pay their currency

428
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
To the US dollar like

429
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,591
Make sure that roughly is certain number of frames as always can equal the dollar

430
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:47,967
And in order to meet this work every country would have to keep a lot of dollars in their vaults

431
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Sazitza

432
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Reserved

433
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,367
That way if the currency went up or down because use dollars to stabilize it

434
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,415
And dollars would be the new anchor for

435
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,023
And these new organizations they created Bretton Woods the World Bank and the IMF

436
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
They too would use dollars

437
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,167
In order to become a member of the organization's you'd have to pay a fee in gold or

438
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,959
Gold convertible currency

439
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
Dollars dollars

440
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,079
Enemies organizations would lend those dollars to indebted countries at

441
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,663
Ben Steele says if you put a plaque up at Bretton Woods

442
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
This is what it would say

443
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
This is where

444
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
The US dollar was

445
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
Crown

446
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
The Supreme unrivaled

447
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
Currency for the world

448
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,743
But no one other than Harry Dexter white really knew this at the

449
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,119
Everyone is working such a Breakneck Pace no one had time to read over the documents as they're being written

450
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,679
John Maynard Keynes was struggling just to keep up

451
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
His health wasn't great

452
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:45,567
It was so overwhelming that it one point as Kansas rushing up the stairs to go to a meeting

453
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,591
He collapses

454
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
His wife tries to hush it up but word spreads

455
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,967
Quickly the Peeper say he had a heart attack

456
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,783
German newspapers ran obituaries

457
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,831
Keynes reportedly was pleased by what

458
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
But it's time to comfort it stretched on

459
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
3 weeks and there was a push to finish up

460
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,047
Food Supplies at the hotel we're running low final dinner at Bretton Woods

461
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,095
All they had was chicken and green bean

462
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
Appealing John Maynard Keynes managed to

463
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
To make it

464
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,543
To the podium and superstar that he was give an inspiring speech to send everyone home with

465
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
A Conway reeds

466
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
The Brotherhood of Man

467
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Will it become

468
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
More than a phrase

469
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
List of presidents

470
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
My move to accept

471
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,855
Big words for a man who hadn't actually seen the final

472
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
They were presented with it for signature

473
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
As they were checking

474
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
There's no record of Harry Dexter White

475
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
Speaking at the final

476
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,095
Even though he had orchestrated everything

477
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
The IMF

478
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
The World Bank

479
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,471
Both headquartered in United States and

480
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,567
The thing he was really after the dollar would be the way the world did this

481
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,639
Tell me the Kingston read the fine print until he got back to Britain

482
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
Was reportedly Furious

483
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
That's specifically about the dollar provisions

484
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,063
What about all the little ways that he felt Britain had been

485
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Screwed over by the emir

486
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,671
Who is laid out at Bretton Woods did work for a few decades

487
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,511
Everyone stayed Peg to the dollar the dollar stayed pick two goals

488
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,143
In 1971 famously that goes away but the Dollar by that point is entrenched

489
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,447
It's the way that countries trade with each other

490
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,519
For seventy years it's been the center of the global economy

491
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
Harry Dexter white the man behind it all

492
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
He didn't fare so well against

493
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,527

Before we finish we need to have

502
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
A little serious talk about

503
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Harry Dexter

504
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,943
Our hero the guy who sealed the dollars dominance in the world

505
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,479
Well

506
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,295
It turns out that is not how he is going to be room

507
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:09,183
Because he got in a little trouble

508
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
Harry Dexter White

509
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,863
Dexter white it turns out was Moonlighting as a Soviet spy

510
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
Passing some information to the Soviets

511
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,263
This apparently was not that uncommon at the time

512
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,847
The Soviets were our allies and historian Ben Steele told me

513
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,431
The treasury Department with literally littered with

514
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:35,039
The 1946 white defended himself in front of a congressional committee

515
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
He died of a heart attack the next day

516
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,927
A few years later there was a dramatic moment where is Soviet double agent

517
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,487
Pulled some microfilm out of a Halo

518
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Pumpkin

519
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,631
That's where he'd hidden some evidence that white was indeed passing information to the Soviets

520
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
Steelbrick ounces

521
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,519
But no one claimed that anything he did at Bretton Woods with anything but

522
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Patriotic

523
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:00,895
Although that is what Harry Dexter white is generally remembered for

524
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
Ild

525
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
Instead of the victory

526
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
For the US dollar

527
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:20,863
