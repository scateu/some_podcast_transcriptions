He is of course he famous actor he has been in dozens of films but we are talking on today because

17
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,840
He is famous for another reason

20

This is big business

24
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
This is the American way

25
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,528
Mr. Snipes

26
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320

29
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,952
Because as crazy as it sounds

30
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
Wesley Snipes

31
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,768
By not paying his taxes

32
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,352
Actually acting in an economically rational way

33
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,888
He been cheating on his taxes

34
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
4 years

35
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,448
And no one seemed to notice that this

36
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,496
Incredibly rich and famous person

37
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,288
Had failed to file taxes

38
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,384
Texas doing what basically everyone does when they fill out their taxes

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
They're making a mental calculation

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
The cost

41
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
And the benefits of lime

42
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,296
The benefits are clearly

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
Getting away with not paying taxes the cost are

44
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Getting caught

45
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696

49
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,376
He says that for people who are self-employed or

50
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912
Take certain kinds of deductions

51
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
There's actually a big Financial

52
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Incentive

53
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
Wesley Snipes

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
For those types of income reporting

55
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:55,712
Your chance of getting caught a really pretty low and even if you're caught the penalties that you would pay would not be able to at great and so

56
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
On those types of reporting

57
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,576
We should see people cheating more than they do

58
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368

00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,288
The fundamental problem is this

78
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,616
People know that they should pay their taxes it is

79
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
The law

80
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
But it's so tempting to cheat

81
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,760
Text collectors can't be everywhere they can't know everything

82
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Cash is untraceable

83
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,416
I want to come to the moment when you report your income when you actually sign that form

84
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
You are generally alone

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,512
No one is looking over your shoulder

86
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
No one

87
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
He's going to know

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
All of the tax collector tricks

89
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
We're going to talk about station or something in common

90
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,216
They're designed to make you think twice in that

91
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Private moment

92
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
To make you sweat

93
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
Turn around and think

94
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
Maybe someone's watching me after all

95
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
The first stop on our tax enforcement tour

96
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
The Philip

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,248
And we picked this country because

98
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,064
This is one of those places where people do not pay their tax

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
Access where there's a high level of corrupt

100
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,416
And they have an interesting solution

101
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,184
They're in the

102
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Their solution

103
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
Make

104
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
The tax collector

105
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
Normally the head of the internal revenue

106
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Is this faceless bureaucrat

107
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
But not in the Philippine

108
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
She's a celebrity

109
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:30,591
My full name is Kim as Jacinto Hernandez and the commissioner of internal revenue of the Philippines

110
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:34,687
All right let me describe Kim for you because her secret weapon is her tough

111
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
Image she's got the short cropped haircut and dresses like an off-duty

112
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
T-top

113
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,343
And she is his expression on her face

114
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Such as

115
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
You're lying to me

116
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
And I know it

117
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
And here's the kicker

118
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
When she's photograph

119
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
She is invariably holding a gun or actually shooting a gun and this isn't just for

120
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,935
Little automatic pistol

121
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
She carries around

122
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,263
She is shooting assault

123
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
Weapon when Filipinos think

124
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
Tax collectors

125
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
That is their image

126
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
A woman with a very large guy

127
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,991
Says before she took office there was a certain mentality

128
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
It's no big deal to cheat on your taxes

129
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
Because what's the worst is going to happen

130
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
For years people think that

131
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
Anyway when they get caught they can always

132
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
Talk their way out of it

133
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
Pay their way out of it

134
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,655
Or they can always wait for an amnesty program

135
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
So Kim decided to

136
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Look deep into the hearts and Minds

137
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
If you look at the psyche of the Filipino

138
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,871
How do you make them toe the line

139
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
It's either

140
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,735
They realize that they will be punished if they do something wrong

141
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Or they will be

142
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,831
Placing an embarrassing situation

143
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,927
The Philippines has almost a hundred million people and so

144
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
JJ isn't that

145
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
Kim is going to flash her gun

146
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
At every tax cheat

147
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
She has a much more targeted

148
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
She is going to go after

149
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
The big dog

150
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
The most high-profile tax evaders

151
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,799
Old thing that you always here in all the prison movies

152
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
On your first day in prison you're supposed to

153
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,175
Take down the biggest meanest guy in the yard and then

154
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,455
Everyone will be afraid of you

155
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
That was Kim's plan

156
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:13,759
Anna Phillips

157
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
When you ask

158
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
Who's the toughest guy around here

159
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
There's only one

160
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Obvious answer

161
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,231
When I was a boy I had to fight to feed my family

162
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,655
Entire life iPhoto survived my only ho

163
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,727
Manny

164
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Pacquiao

165
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
The legendary Filipino boxer

166
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,359
Be the man who famously Rose from poverty

167
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,663
Two become one of the richest athlete

168
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
In the world

169
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,015
Super famous in the Philippines even want a seat in Congress

170
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
The dude is on a postage stamp

171
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,135
And Kim says when she got the job she went down this list

172
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
The richest people in

173
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Philippines

174
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
And there was Manny Pacquiao

175
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Strangely

176
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
What you checked

177
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
She realized

178
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
She was paying less taxes

179
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
He had the year before

180
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,399
Even though he was clearly more famous

181
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,263
Successful so Kim looks into it and she finds that Pacquiao owes

182
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,335
50 million dollars in back taxes

183
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
And so

184
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
She

185
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
Did something that people

186
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Tend not to do in the Philippines

187
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,759

00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
Everything knows all the cheaters

Taxpayers were afraid of Kim

260
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
It's the people who work for her

261
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Tax collectors

262
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,591
Kim says that she's cracking down on corruption in her own Department

00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
This is a place where the former prime minister

284
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Silvio Berlusconi

285
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415

00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,743
Text Rod he committed while he was running the country

292
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,311
Both of them those dudes Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana

293
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
Were convicted of tax evasion

294
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Even

295
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
Giorgio Armani

296
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943

297
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:38,111
And yeah I'm like the Philippines all these are rest of these famous people then it seemed to have helped the problem I mean

298
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
People didn't seem scared

299
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
In fact it kind of the opposite effect like oh well those guys aren't paying their taxes

300
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Why should I pay

301
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863

305
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
To translate it would be

306
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
Something like

307
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
Income matter or

308
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663

If you agree

311
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,271
It's nice to keep the Italian word

312
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
Rave theater

313
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111

There's no tough tax agents

316
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,463
The gun in Italy

317
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,279
Instead there's Kiara patola

318
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
And this program

319
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Redito Metro

320
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
Mickey and behind-the-scenes

321
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,751
The Chinese government has basically declared that they're watching how Italians spend their money

322
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Literally

323
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
Keeping list

324
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
What Italians Buy

325
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
So they can look at

326
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
Some Italian businessman

327
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Giovanni

328
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,223
Looks like they can see what Giovanni declares his

329
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,295
And then they can check a list that they put together

330
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,599
Exactly what Giovanni has

331
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
In spending his money on

332
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
His purchases

333
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,743
The government can see if Giovanni is spending more money than he says he may

334
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
So they know what kind of house do you want

335
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
Or a car

336
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
If you buy a car

337
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,751
Of course you have to register the car in the in the right in the public register

338
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031

339
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Ultimo DIA

340
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,127
And we automatically gathered information

341
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,991
So if Giovanni has a Ferrari he had better be reporting enough income

342
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
To afford a Ferrari

343
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,111
The tax office can also make private businesses rat you out

344
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
Some stores report to the government who exactly is buying what

345
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463

378
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,647
When there is a big big big discrepancy between

379
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
The two

380
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Well

381
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
You may be off

382
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,767
Come to the revenue just to

383
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Explain

384
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,119
What is the your source of income

385
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
She makes it sound so polite

386
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:35,263
She even said they sent you an invitation letter to come down to their offices

387
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
So far they sent out

388
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
20000

389
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
And just like in the Philippines the power of this

390
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Is it

391
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
Everybody knows about this new program

392
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,319
In fact we're looking some of the news reports from Italy

393
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
And when this was announced

394
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
People

395
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Went

396
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,535
Nuts are going to Ono I can't buy art down you know I spent all my money on Earth

397
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,119
There was one woman who was complaining that did she has

398
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Free horses

399
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
Because I have three horses in yet

400
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,007
I've spent all my money on these horses so I'm not rich

401
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,311
I'm just a poor person with three horses

402
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
The government

403
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
The government's going to assume that I'm rich

404
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,991
And then there was his Art Gallery owner complaining that people would stop buying luxury

405
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
Because they would worry

406
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,087
That the government was going to get tipped off to them

407
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
Which you know

408
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,695
If true is not a good thing for a country coming out of a recession

409
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,511
But you know what else is not good for Country coming out of a recession

410
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
Nobody paying their tax

411
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,839
That's the argument the key Arabic

412
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Aqi says

413
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
Hey if Italy

414
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
We got to try some

415
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,007
All right so so far we have two very different ways the tax man

416
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
Or woman gets into your head

417
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
The gun-toting sheriff

418
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Sneaky bureaucrat

419
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
All scary in their own ways

420
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
But maybe

421
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
There's an easier way

422
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:52,063
We're going to hear about that after this quick message

423
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:56,927

All right we taking you from the Philippines to Italy next up let's go to the UK

431
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,903
In the past it was it was generally thought that Pino enforcement the only thing that matters

432
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,767
But increasing people thinking other things Metro

433
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Not just

434
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,607
Am I going to get cool but is this the right thing

435
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
To do

436
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
This is Michael Hall

437
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
And he was part of a special team of a

438
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Economist

439
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Policy folks

440
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
Put together by the UK government

441
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:48,895
Did you a bunch of stuff including think about ways to get more UK residents

442
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
To pay their taxes

443
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:55,807
This bunch of brainiacs who spent years studying social science and behavioral economics

444
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111
It was called the behavioral insights

445
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
Italy or the Philippines

446
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,231
Okay we're in a minute the UK barely has

447
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
What's the problem

448
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
They are some law-abiding folks there

449
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
But still

450
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:13,471
When the principles of life is the tax man does not rest until he or she is at 100% enforcement

451
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,311
And that was basically what they brought to the behavioral insights

452
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
We want to make sure that everyone in the UK

453
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
100000 people

454
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,759
Filed a tax return but hadn't paid up

455
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
The deadbeat

456
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Deadbeats

457
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,087
With an address

458
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
So they decided to conduct this

459
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Experiment on

460
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
Is there a way to guilt

461
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
Linda Payne there taxes

462
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Without sending a Cop 2

463
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,095
And in this is this is the dream of

464
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,167
Tax enforcement agent everywhere you can just send out

465
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
A threatening letter and someone going to send the money

466
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
And it rarely rarely work

467
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
These guys wanted to figure out

468
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,383
How do you send out a letter that will convince

469
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,175
Double get inside

470
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
Text Sheepshead that will make her

471
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,783
Him her feel bad it will make someone do the right thing

472
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,575
If you look at it

473
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,111
Diverse Nomex

474
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
I want to see

475
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
Important Concepts

476
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,463
The keeps coming up to social norms

477
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,791
So what influenced by what other people do in the same situation

478
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,095
And they started by figuring out what does

479
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
Okay we can be bureaucratic

480
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,703
We can be whiny or mean

481
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
Did you consider anything like more extreme like listen idiots it's your taxes you have to pay that video you don't have a choice

482
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,711
No not really

483
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,039
This is actually a serious point which is that

484
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,111
Timing is really important we know that

485
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,463
People pick up from this if if the tone is preps overly

486
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,071
Aggressive people may actually react against them so they will know I'm not cancer

487
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
Looking to do this

488
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,399
So we really wanted to come up with something which

489
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Which

490
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
Reasonable time

491
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,519
For two years they try different wording in

492
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
The tax letter some simply said that most

493
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
People pay their taxes

494
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,895
Others talked about the good things

495
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
Set taxes pay for

496
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Hospital

497
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
In school

498
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
And in the end the message that work the best

499
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
Is this simple phrase

500
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Quote

501
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,183
You are currently in the very small minority of people who have not

502
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
Peanuts yet

503
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
I love at the very small

504
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
Minority

505
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,631
A people who have not paid us yet which is probably how it makes you feel right very

506
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Small

507
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
And Electric

508
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,519
Fit into what we know in economics about fairness

509
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:28,639
Basically if you think that nobody else is paying their taxes you're not going to pay your tax

510
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
Either but

511
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,759
If you think that everyone is if you think that you're the small or

512
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
In the morning the letter D very small minority

513
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,111
You will tend to go along with the crowd

514
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
And this message at work

515
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Michael says

516
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:45,279
People more than any of the others sent in the money they owed to the government

517
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,655
It was so successful that the UK is still using this messaging and letters being sent out to

518
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,935
Delinquent taxpayers

519
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Right now

520
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,519
The Economist James arm that we spoke to at the beginning

521
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
The guy who said that

522
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Text cheats rarely get caught

523
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
He says when you use

524
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
All of these kind of techniques that we

525
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
We talked about today

526
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
When you use them

527
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:07,295
You're really making people redo their economic calculation

528
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
There may only really

529
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
Be a 1%

530
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,671
Or 2% chance of getting audited

531
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,207
What's the chance of getting caught

532
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,279
What you doing tricks does is it makes you

533
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
Feel

534
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
Like the chance of getting caught

535
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,143
The chance of somebody seeing you is big

536
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
Do you have to use

537
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,823
Lots of different approaches lots of different tools and import because there are so many different motivations for

538
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
People

539
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
In deciding whether to

540
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
To pay their taxes

541
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Properly

542
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,759
Context matters institutions matter country matters

543
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,807
Until you you can't simply take

544
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,855
A one-size-fits-all

545
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Approach

546
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,695
And assume that it's always going to have the same effects at all settings

547
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,743
And James alms for the records

548
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,791
He told us he pays all of his tax

549
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
Even at time when you 150 bucks

550
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
In NCAA

551
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
He declared it

552
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,751
So what is it for you like what motivates you personally to do things like

553
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
Declare your NCAA pool

554
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
Which as you yourself said

555
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,871
Yeah they're not going to catch you on

556
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,991
It's not because I am afraid of getting caught that's not because

557
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,807
Getting the special good service from the IRS I think it's

558
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
Because I think that's the right thing to do

559
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,903
To the social norms are at work on you

560
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,304
