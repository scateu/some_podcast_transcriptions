00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,280
Hi Alex goldmark here

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:03,072
This is a bonus episode

3
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,120
Because we're celebrating a special occasion

4
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,936
Are other podcast the indicator from Planet Money

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,472
Turned one-year-old this month

6
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,008
It is daily

7
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:15,104
It's short and we're proud of it so we have picked out one of our favorite episodes

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,896
From the indicators first-year to

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
This one ran back in March

10
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
It is

11
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,016
Standardized test

12
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:26,880
Kids I know it's a very

13
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,440
And we thought this would be the perfect time

14
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,512
Explore this really interesting little economic story

15
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,792
About creative

16
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,120
Creative destruction that is the idea that the

17
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,168
Economy is always evolving

18
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
If there are new products

19
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,984
Are constantly being invented

20
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
And those inventions make the

21
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,800
The old products

22
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Absolutely

23
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,360
And his forces usually pretty

24
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,408
The movie reel

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,688
The video cassette

26
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
Comes to DVD becomes

27
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
Is online streaming

28
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,808
Things are always getting more convenient

29
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,088
Faster easier

30
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:57,856
Cheaper

31
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,392
But there are little pocket

32
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,464
The economy or the laws of creative destruction RC

33
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,280
Suspended like little islands of old school

34
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,352
Places where being old and outdated

35
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
Is a competitive advantage

36
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,216
This is the indicator on Stacey Vanek Smith

37
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,568
Ankara Garcia indicator is 1994

38
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,616
Take yourself back Bill Clinton was President

39
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
E stamp

40
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,688
Cost $0.29 and

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
The SATs decided to allow students

42
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
Graphing calculators on standardized tests

43
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
Support also comes from the UPS Store

44
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,448
From printing packing and copying

45
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,752
To faxing mailboxing and notarizing

46
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,616
The UPS Store offers everything for small business and this Memorial Day weekend

47
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,944
May 24th and 25th when others may be closing

48
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,016
The UPS Store is doing another thing altogether

49
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Opening

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
Because small businesses

51
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
Owners can't afford to take days off

52
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
The UPS Store

53
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,976
Every ink for small business and of course shipping

54
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,328
So card if I don't know what your living room look like when you were a kid

55
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
But if we took

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
A time machine back to my childhood home

57
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,472
The technology would seem pretty amazing right now

58
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,776
I had in my room of course a boombox

59
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
It was pain

60
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
It's a lot of D batteries

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,176
We had a VHS player we had a landline telephone with

62
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
Is answering machine that played

63
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
These little tapes

64
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,136
We had a family computer it was enormous and it was beige and it weighed like a million pounds and it was connected to

65
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
A dot matrix

66
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
I remember those days

67
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
None of that technology is around today

68
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,304
And the reason is not around

69
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Creative destruction

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
A phrase that an economist named Joseph schumpeter came up with Mark Perry is an economist at the American Enterprise

71
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
Institute

72
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,104
And he says creative destruction can be this really

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
Difficult and destructive forces

74
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
But it's also a really

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
Creative destruction is just

76
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,064
Continue all and Powerful

77
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
Very positive force in a market economy

78
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,232
It just reflects the dynamism and changes in technology and I'll differ

79
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
Some types of fields and so sometimes in my

80
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,096
On my block I call it hurricane Joseph

81
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
Ssds gales

82
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
Creative destruction that are kind of

83
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
Disrupting markets

84
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
Hurricane Joseph

85
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,800
Economist never change

86
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
In Creative destruction is why none of the

87
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
The technology

88
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
From my childhood exist today

89
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Except

90
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
Cardiff it's all coming back around

91
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
The Graphic Edge

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
What

93
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952
I know it do I don't know do you remember I said there was big calculator there like the size of a Hershey bar yeah

94
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,536
Borders you are sick they were like the original iPads

95
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
But without being able to do anything

96
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
Except give you a nice cosine graph

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,728
Right they could they could do calculus in an absolutely nothing else

98
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
Screen and you could type equations

99
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
I remember mine 12

100
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
We spent a lot of time together me and my graphic

101
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
And I looked on Amazon the other

102
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,552
And TI is still making these calculators

103
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
And so is Cassio and

104
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
Cartas de look

105
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
Exactly the same

106
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
Really busy or not

107
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
Are they still work

108
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Even going to believe it

109
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
I mean hopefully

110
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
It

111
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,959
Appears to be every bit as complicated and

112
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Like is dense with

113
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
Tiny button

114
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
As I remember

115
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,431
So yes you're right you're not wrong and ends in thinking it is to look and feel

116
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Peter Belita is

117
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
The president of Education technology at 10

118
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,647
We could easily add features to a calculator is like a touchscreen Wi-Fi or camera

119
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
But we don't

120
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
I mean

121
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,767
Are blenders that can connect to the internet matter connect to the internet

122
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
Well done

123
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:54,143
Thank you my mind is still quite analog I'm afraid

124
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,263
But the idea that a piece of modern technology would not connect to the Internet is almost unthinkable

125
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
And yet

126
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,895
That fact is what makes these calculators special in fact

127
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
If the graphing calculator

128
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
Were connected to the internet

129
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
It would be less valuable

130
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
There wouldn't even be a reason for its exist

131
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,463
Because it you can compromise the test security and really detract from what the calculators are designed to do

132
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
Did once represent cutting-edge

133
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Technology

134
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
It took standardized

135
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Cast designer

136
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
Years

137
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
Before they would allow graphing calculator

138
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
To be used on the

139
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Their testes

140
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
Test makers worried

141
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
Data calculator

142
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Would give students

143
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Unfair advantage

144
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
Now it's exactly the opposite

145
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,407
Graphing calculators are pretty much the only technology

146
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,967
That standardized test makers will allow

147
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
Because I'm like smart phones or laptops

148
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,807
The graphing calculator is not

149
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
Connected to the internet

150
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
Yes its value lies in the fact that

151
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Technology

152
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,487
And speaking of value people pay a lot for this

153
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Anachronistic

154
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,815
Most graphing calculators cost

155
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Around $100

156
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
Which is about what I paid when I got mine

157
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
The technology was really cutting edge

158
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,823
And now you can buy devices that will do far more for far less money

159
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
M&S Peter at TI about

160
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:12,479
It does seem like the price hasn't gone down that much it seems like the price

161
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,039
You know considering the technology involved Maybe

162
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
Should have gone down more buying graphing calculator with graphing calculator

163
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
Really

164
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
A solution for a classroom

165
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,327
Apus if you think about it high school calculus and

166
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
Physics students are a captive Market

167
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Mark says

168
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Hurricane Joseph

169
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
Is usually inescapable but these

170
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
Or like Island

171
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
Isolated peoples

172
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
Creative destruction

173
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Doesn't reach

174
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
Had a really interesting

175
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,199
Product you just think about her or appreciate I guess for there

176
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,319
Ability to stay frozen in time after many many decades and over a generation of changed

177
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
It's disrupted everything else

178
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
These calculators are giant in

179
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Bulky

180
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
And students basically are forced to buy them

181
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
For school

182
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
They also look like something

183
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
From another era

184
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
And honestly

185
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,143
Given the archaic technology that use their still

186
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Pretty expensive

187
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
But Peter Belita says

188
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
A lot of people still get attached to

189
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,591
A lot of students he says he gets calls and letters from them

190
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
All the time

191
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
