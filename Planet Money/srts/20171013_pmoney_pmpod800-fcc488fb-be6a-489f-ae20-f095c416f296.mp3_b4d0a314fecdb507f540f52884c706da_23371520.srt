1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04,352
By now we are all very familiar with North Korea's accelerated mistletoe

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,912
And we're pretty sure we know how they got the

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,680
Technology

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:13,824
How did they get the money I mean Mercury is broke right there Extinction to the teeth

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,176
How on Earth could they afford to get their hands on some of the most expensive

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,224
Coveted technology on the planet

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,296
How old are you what is your age

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,696
26 years old how would you describe yourself to someone who's never seen you

9
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,768
Picture of the Cure

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:37,888
I'm sexy and cute at the same time

11
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,168
This is Jesse

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
She is from North

13
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,568
And she grabbed it has been a town on the northern border on this river called the Yellow River

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,408
Dishonest time is known as

15
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,944
Place that is closest

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
To China

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,784
When we open the door and go outside

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,832
You can basically see China there

19
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,136
Jesse is in Seoul South Korea now

20
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,208
I spoke with her over Skype through my translator G Haley

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
Who was able to affirm that

22
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
Yes

23
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
Jesse is sexy and cute

24
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,584
At the same time

25
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:11,168
It's true I can attest to that

26
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,216
Jesse says money was always really

27
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
Tight when she was growing up

28
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,080
If you needed something you had to find a way to get money for

29
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872
When she was 8 years old

30
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
Her family needed matches

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,968
So she and her brother went up into the mountains

32
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,760
Picked a bunch of wild raspberries

33
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,296
And sold them at the local

34
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,136
The toy of Marco manga

35
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
Mommy went to the market and we started selling and it sold well not because people loves wildberries but

36
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:42,144
Because there was an eight-year-old girl trying to sell all these wild berries at the

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
At the market

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,008
Jesse meet 45 North Korean won selling her Berry set

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
That is about a name

40
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:53,664
It was the first time she's ever had money of her own and she still remembers how it felt in

41
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
So you bought the matches

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
And then she saw these

43
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
She says her mom

44
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
Loved

45
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:05,440
Her mom is one of those people who was always doing things for other people never really did anything for herself

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,768
So Jesse took her left over money and she bought her mom

47
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
Peach

48
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,840
Bolt Santa Cruz

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
When I got that peach and I saw her

50
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:22,080
Getting the peach and eating the peach she looks really happy and it made me really happy that's when I realized

51
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,896
I want to make a lot of money to make her happy

52
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,224
Jessie started selling berries and other things at the market right now

53
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
Saving up for earnings looking for more opportunities

54
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
And then one day she had this Flash

55
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Of brilliance

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,696
She noticed that the men in her Village Railways gather for a drink

57
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
The end of the day

58
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,816
And they were drinking is alcohol that they were making themselves out of the potatoes they were farming

59
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,888
I just thought you could get them better stuff

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
So she hitched a ride to a bigger city

61
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
Oliver Berryman

62
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
All of it

63
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
Ecchi bought corn alcohol

64
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
As much as she could carry

65
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,128
And she walked back to her Village

66
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
It was a six hour walk

67
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:02,272
Doki-Doki because I was little I couldn't

68
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,600
Bring back more than 5 kg of alcohol

69
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
That's about 10

70
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,488
Who does he walks for 6 hours with all this corn alcohol she gets to her house

71
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
She cuts it with a little water

72
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,608
And then she tells her grandmother to go into town and spread the word

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
The day were selling the good stuff

74
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
Ikuto narcotic

75
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:27,360
My alcohol is really really popular because it was very pure there was no hangover and so

76
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
And they said it was a huge difference

77
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
Jesse had more orders than she

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
A small business was born

79
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,320
Little pilot light of capitalism

80
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
Right in the heart

81
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,928
Locked down restrictive socialist regime in the world

82
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:47,328
Hello

83
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
And welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

84
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
North Korea got a lot of its missile money

85
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
From us

86
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,568
From ideas the US has been exporting all over the world for deca

87
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
The free market

88
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
The entrepreneurial spirit

89
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
Good old-fashioned

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Capitalism

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
North Korea's missile money

92
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
Started with people like jazz

93
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,368
Today on the show we go inside the hermit Kingdom

94

And meet North Korea's capital

95
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952

There is a special name for North Korea's entrepreneurial type

104
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Like Jessie

105
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
They're called

106
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
The dungeon

107
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
It means Lords of

108
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,591
3 years ago there is no way that don't you would have existed in North

109
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,967
It's a socialist country people are supposed to work for the good of the whole and get everything they need from the governor

110
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
The idea of Mickey

111
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,831
Making a profit or growing a business or even owning something

112
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Blasphemy

113
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
The North Korean regime in fact had a special

114
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Term for it

115
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
Honey coated poison

116
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
And we the Western General wanted North Korea to swallow the honey coated poison

117
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,191
Wow that is some

118
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,007
Siri

119
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,079
Nicholas eberstadt is with the American Enterprise Institute

120
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
He's been studying the North Korean

121
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,127
Economy since

122
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
70s

123
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,711
Isis the shocking thing to him is the back then

124
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,295
North and South Korea are in a heated economic race

125
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,903
Now South Korea's economy is 50 times larger than North Korea

126
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,207
Just to put this into perspective

127
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
The state of Wyoming

128
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,047
Has a bigger economy than North Korea

129
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,631
North Korea is the only place in

130
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
Human history

131
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,983
That has suffered a famine

132
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
During peacetime

133
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
With an urbanized deliberate population it's almost impossible to do but they managed somehow to do that in the 19

134
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Nineties

135
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
That famine was known as the arduous

136
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,343
North Korea's economy collapsed and made from Russia dried up

137
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
Hundreds of thousands of

138
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
People starve to death

139
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
Bodies were piled up in the street

140
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
And for years the North Korean people were

141
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
On their own

142
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,143
So they started scraping together what they could little bits of food basic necessities

143
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,191
I'm coming together in Market

144
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
Like the one where Jesse sold her ass.

145
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
And these markets got bigger and bigger

146
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
And the government just

147
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Let it happen

148
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,247
From the North Korean leadership standpoint it was a devil's deal that had to be struck

149
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
To prevent

150
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,319
Big total breakdown of the state

151
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,135
It's got a long way since that

152
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,439
And now there's a hole

153
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Class of

154
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Market

155
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,351
Tiaras and Dungy work I gave my side don't you like North Korea Miyabi's

156
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,423
The country's leader Kim Jong-il what occasionally Crackdown

157
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,471
On the don't you throw some of them in prison

158
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
Close down some markets

159
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
But when Kim Jong-il son Kim Jong-un

160
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Give me the power

161
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
He had a very different approach

162
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
City Island

163
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:21,087
Immigrant Song

164
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
But the era struggle is over

165
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
We declare two main goals for his country

166
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
Number one to build up the weapon

167
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
At number two

168
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
To grow the economy

169
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Growing the economy

170
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,983
That meant making a little more room to maneuver for this tiny glass

171
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
Don't you

172
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
The North Korean government

173
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,335
Has

174
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
Illicitly

175
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Reveal

176
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,247
That they believe they can take a little bit more of that

177
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
Honey-coated poison

178
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
Then would have been tolerated in the past

179
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
And that's getting economic results

180
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
But North Korean entrepreneurs with a real disadvantage

181
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
Things that are just like in our blood in

182
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,119
Marketing two-for-one sales venture capital

183
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,679
These things don't really exist in North

184
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,007
Kim Jeong Hoon decided to help out the don't you

185
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,359
He started letting business experts come in from overseas

186
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
And Coach them

187
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,991
For the last several years I've been involved with a nonprofit called just an exchange

188
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,599
The trains North Koreans in entrepreneurship and economic policy

189
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,391
This is Andre abrahamian

190
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,695
He's been to North Korea dozens of times

191
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Teaching classes on things

192
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
Marketing management

193
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Counting trade

194
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
North Korea cool with this they'll say like

195
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Great

196
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
Come like spread your

197
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
Capitalist ways in art like heaven

198
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
Heavens no we're not

199
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,847
Spreading capitalism by any means

200
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
We are just

201
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
Introducing

202
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
Management techniques

203
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
So that

204
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
They can

205
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,527
Develop their economy

206
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
More

207
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Efficiently

208
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,135
In 2010 Andre caught in a plane in China

209
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
Headed to north

210
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,999
He was on a quest to train the North Korean d'anjou

211
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
Western-style business

212
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,631
Basically bringing honey-coated poison into North Korea with

213
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
Kim Jong On Blessing

214
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,959
Nothing about this was normal

215
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Not even the play

216
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
So it's sort of like

217
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,847
Stepping back in time and they were running quite old Russian play

218
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Kind of like from the 60s wear

219
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,503
Cute doilies on the window as if you were

220
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Visiting

221
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
Grandmother's house rather than

222
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
An airline a little lace curtains

223
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
Yeah I like little lace curtains

224
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
As soon as the plane took off

225
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Music started

226
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
Blasting

227
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,375
For the cabin these loud rousing songs about the government and its

228
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Triumph

229
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,263
They were promoting a very important National technology that they had developed

230
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
And so they had a song to go along with it

231
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
And

232
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
And you know after one or two rounds it would really

233
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Get stuck in your head

234
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
Andres plane landed just outside of Pyongyang

235
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,495
Van and rode into the city for the first time

236
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
The city that had been

237
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
Totally sealed off to people like him

238
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
For decades

239
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,527
As you approach Victory Street your start to get confronted with the monoliths of the city so there's a huge

240
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,087
What they call a mortality Tower

241
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
Massive kind of obelisk

242
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
When you come around the corner and your

243
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,767
You're confronted with those huge statues of Kennesaw and Kim Jong-il

244
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
20 meter high

245
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Bronze

246
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
At just

247
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
Looking out over their domain

248
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
For eternity

249
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,287
Audrey says it's really beautiful city very August

250
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,127
It's a lot of parks lot of Green Space what people outside

251
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
One thing he did not see

252
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
There are no ads

253
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
You know you're not saying

254
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
Sunglasses are

255
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
Makeup bag

256
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,623
The only odds are for the country

257
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
It's Elfin

258
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
Their socialism in their leadership

259
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
No

260
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Advertising

261
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,815
And that was just one of the obstacles Andre encounter

262
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,143
Trying to teach this equal groups of don't you how to grow their businesses

263
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
Another problem

264
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
There's a lot of stuff they could not

265
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Talk about

266
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,335
So in one case we wanted to talk about the trade relationship between

267
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,919
China and North Korea but that is obviously very political

268
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
And so what I Workshop leader very cleverly did

269
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
Was he traded

270
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Two fictional island

271
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
Big island and small island

272
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
And

273
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,671
Everybody in the room

274
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Newegg

275
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
Because they knew who the small island bus and they knew the big island was

276
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
But they were able to have a really shoot fruitful

277
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
Discussion about how to manage a trade relationship

278
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
With a much larger partner

279
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Because it was abstracted

280
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
And Reese's don't you would

281
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Crowded to his classes

282
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,615
People who ran retail shop shoe factory software companies

283
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
People with startup ideas

284
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:07,295
The government even let chosen exchange take a group of entrepreneurs and brought to see how people run businesses overseas

285
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,671
Understood some of the dones you were so poor they brought their luggage in plastic shopping bag

286
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,511
They were so excited to go and so excited to see it

287
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
What do you want to see in Singapore

288
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
That's what's in a what

289
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
What are you curious about

290
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
An ATM

291
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
Never seen one

292
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
I heard about him

293
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983

294
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,335

295
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,151
The guy was like awesome

296
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
This is this is so cool

297
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
Can't wait for us to get these in my country

298
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,295
Would you like taking photos of ATM

299
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
I took photos of everything

300
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
The don't you or getting training

301
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
Port businesses were growing

302
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,511
The growing local businesses was not going to be enough to

303
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,583
To expand North Korea's economy the way Kim Jong unwine

304
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
To do that

305
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
They were going to need to bring in money from overseas

306
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
Oh hello

307
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
Ojai

308
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:58,751
Can you hear me

309
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,079
Yeah although your voice is a little bit

310
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
Oh sorry I will

311
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
Is that better

312
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
No it's not that

313
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,479
Call Tia is a Dutch business consultant

314
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
We spoke over Skype

315
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Currently the connection was

316
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Great

317
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,855
Paul Pierce Western companies up

318
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
With Asian businesses

319
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,927
He's been working with North Korea since the 90

320
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,815
He says since Kim Jong on to power a lot more international business is being done in North Korea

321
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,911
For example maybe your smartphone is from

322
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
Come Samsung in South Korea

323
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,495
Food maker

324
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
In that case it contains some software

325
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,871
Which was made in North Korea

326
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
Paul says you cannot find products like

327
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,479
Heineken beer and Philips Electronics in North Korea

328
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Korean stores

329
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,343
We talked about companies they denied doing any business in North Korea

330
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,415
But pauses it can be hard to know what's actually

331
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,743
Because companies always deny doing business in North Korea

332
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,303
The associated with the country is really bad

333
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
PR

334
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,935
Butthole says the sanctions are not as tight as you think and a lot of Western company

335
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Do you do business with

336
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
North Korea

337
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
Although some of them don't actually

338
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
No it

339
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
Your Walt Disney Company

340
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
It happened soft area

341
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Animation

342
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
Work took place in North Korea

343
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
Is that true was lying

344
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
The lion

345
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,879
Apparently partially drawn by SEK Studios

346
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Pyongyang

347
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
North Korea

348
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,487
So it was outsourced I think to the Philippines

349
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,559
But then somebody decided it was cheaper

350
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
Situated North Korea

351
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
So it was actually done in Pyongyang

352
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,239
Without by the way do not Shuffle this

353
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
Kim jong-un's plan was working

354
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:42,943
Local businesses were thriving foreign investment was increasing and North Korea's economy was growing

355
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,807
Capital City pallet construction boom ice skating rink in a floating restaurant

356
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,367
Pyongyang is tightly controlled by the government

357
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
It's kind of a show place for

358
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,767
Princeton's people with wheelchairs are not allowed in the city because the government thinks

359
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
Nevertheless party says

360
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
The changes he saw were strike

361
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
Do you see a lot of

362
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:10,335
Recent new buildings let's say 30 40 or 50 stores

363
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,639
Haifa skyscrapers

364
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,711
Much more traffic than in the past and sometimes

365
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,783
You even come across traffic jams

366
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
N

367
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
I see fit

368
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
North Korean

369
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,951
You see fat North Koreans wear in the fall

370
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
The real change says Paul is in the mentality of the North

371
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,607
Everybody talks too now has a startup ID

372
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
They all want to go into

373
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,703
There's almost no venture capital.

374
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
We had in North

375
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
But there is the startup mentality

376
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,847
The tech sector has grown a bit there's a domestic

377
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:49,247
Internet and even an Amazon type company called men will song where you order online anything from noodles to two

378
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
By fours and can get them delivered

379
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,183
Andre abrahamian the business teacher says he has seen the effects of his teachings first-hand

380
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,511
Most recently when he visited the cafe of one of his students

381
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
In Pyongyang

382
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,095
I did notice that the barista

383
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
At the coffee shop starting to give

384
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,959
A little freebies making me tiny decisions

385
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
On their own. Generally North Korean

386
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Weight.

387
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Just do not do

388
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
So I'd like to think that we

389
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
Contributed to

390
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,967
Slight change in mindset there did you get a little freebie

391
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,759
As a customer

392
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
What did you get your number

393
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
Extra shot of espresso

394
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,671
Jesse aren't North Korean entrepreneur, bootleggers

395
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,719
Also caught this entrepreneurial spirit

396
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:35,583
Her business grew and expanded and she started trading products back and forth with China

397
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
Smuggling things across the border

398
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
She would send medicinal herbs

399
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
Animal skins and pine nuts over

400
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
China across the yalu river in

401
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
These boats

402
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,847
And she would bring very in-demand items back

403
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
To North Korea

404
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
I'm going to

405
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
What you doing

406
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
And what we would get in return is

407
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
Sausages

408
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
And we would get

409
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Soaps

410
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
And there's something called

411
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Macarena

412
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,743
That is an artificial sweetener that North Koreans like to use in desert

413
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
This is one of Jesse's biggest seller

414
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,351
In fact she uses it at her home in Seoul

415
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,423
She ran to the kitchen to let my translator jihae try some

416
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Taste like

417
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
Dried whipped cream

418
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,871
Jessie's business had gone

419
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
International

420
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Carnival

421
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,503
Jingle getting the business was prospering on a whole new level

422
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
And so was North Korea's government

423
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,367
Kim Jong un's plan to grow the economy with work

424
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
The don't you like Jessie Ware doing better

425
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,767
They were making more money and paying more in taxes and bribes to the north

426
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Korean government

427
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,351
It was also more money coming in from other country

428
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
Trees from overseas

429
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,983
Political Economist Nicholas eberstadt says all of that money

430
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Whistling Straits

431
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
21 place

432
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
Nuclear weapons

433
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:55,455
You have to assume that the real a rapid increase in the tempo of the testing

434
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
Has something to do with getting more funds to do it

435
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,599
The economic Prosperity that you helped bring to North Korea

436
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
Made the nuclear program possible for

437
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,535
And all the subversive semen capitalism the marketing training International relationships

438
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,631
All of it is ultimately gone to support the military ambitions

439
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
Of Kim Jong-il

440
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:21,055
And this puts people like Paul and Andre in a really strange position when they originally started working in North Korea to try to

441
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Help

442
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
People's Credit

443
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,639
Bring money into the economy

444
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,735
And help a population that had at one point literally been starving in the streets

445
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
But they did help North

446
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,087
Korea become a wealthier country

447
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,879
Abe Mor weaponized

448
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,927
Do you ever feel

449
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
In ethical conflicts

450
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
Working with North Korea

451
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
I don't have to be ashamed

452
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
To support this

453
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
Economic cooperation

454
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
Because it also helps

455
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
The individual worker

456
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
In the Garment Factory for example

457
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
You will not hear me

458
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Torquing

459
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
Sfsf Fentanyl

460
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
The North Korea

461
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Cortical cyst

462
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
I'm not a fan of them

463
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,343
If we want to see changes in North Korea

464
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
It has to be changed from the inside

465
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
Like

466
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
We have seen in China

467
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:15,071
It is only because of an upcoming middle class

468
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
The second weekend

469
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Chase

470
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,447
But that upcoming middle-class is in a really

471
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,287
Is North Korea the state technically owns every

472
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,359
Don't you were always operating in a legal Gray

473
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
Everything they have could be

474
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,943
Be taken away at any moment

475
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,271
And the wealth that they accrue can make them targets

476
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
In fact that is what happened to Jesse

477
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,879
Her business is booming she was making more money

478
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,439
And people close to her started to notice

479
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,255
A tattoo

480
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,559
My uncle realized that I was doing all this

481
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,119
It's business and he didn't approve of it at all in

482
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,167
And he reported me

483
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,751
I felt like everything vanished and everything just evaporated in

484
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
Snap of a moment

485
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Basically what I had was

486
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,615
Almost all gone

487
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,919
Years and years of work just

488
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Went up in smoke

489
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,247
And Jesse said she was actually lucky she wasn't sent to

490
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:11,135
But it was at that moment that Jesse realize she was never going to be able to have a stable life in North

491
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,207
Korea is far as building her business back up she says

492
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,487
Her heart just wasn't in it

493
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Her mother had died

494
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,375
And her mother was the whole inspiration for her going into business in the first play

495
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
Until

496
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:31,615
It felt like the sky was falling for me I had nowhere to turn to I have nobody to lean on Jessie decided to leave nor

497
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,711
She had relationships with border guards in China and North Korea from

498
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
Smuggler for all those years

499
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
So one night she just

500
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
Smuggled herself out

501
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,695
Across the yalu river on one of the same boats that should use to transport animal skins and sweetener back in

502
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,511
All Jessie's money everything she owned

503
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
Taken by the government

504
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
And again

505
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,863
The government had always owned it all anyway

506
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,679
Political Economist Nicholas eberstadt says

507
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:00,543
People like Jesse are the real tragedy of the current situation in North Korea

508
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,407
Kim Jong on got what he wanted he got the money he needed to grow the nuclear program

509
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
But it came of course at a huge price for the North Korean peace

510
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,807
Yes the nuclear threat yes

511
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
The missiles Radley

512
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
Vicious

513
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
Threats against

514
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
People abroad

515
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
But that's just the Janus face

516
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,280
Of what's happening at home

517
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
All the time to millions and millions of people who

518
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
Don't have a voice

519
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
And

520
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,704
I guess I find that to be the saddest part

521
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,032
The latest round of sanctions and political pressure

522
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
From the US

523
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,360
Is having a big effect on North Korea stones

524
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:40,480
Funding has dried up for entrepreneurial training everything is more expensive and harder to get

525
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:45,088
And Patia says foreign companies are pulling out of North Korea as fast as they can

526
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
But don't you have always been a country

527
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
Prediction in North

528
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
They were allowed to exist got these little freedoms

529
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,816
Because they helped build up North Korea's military might

530
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,888
But now that Kim jung-hoon has that military might

531
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
But don't you are any more fragile position

532
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,336
Will give you an update on Jesse right after that

Jesse is now a student in Seoul South

542
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:47,552
And I asked her if she's planning on going into business for herself and she has

543
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,904
All of this amazing business experience that she's now in a place where entrepreneurship is actually

544
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
Celebrated

545
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
But you told me

546
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,488
She doesn't think she wants to go into

547
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,328
Buspar years in North Korea have changed what she thinks of

548
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
A success

549
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,704
Linda Hamilton age I realize the value of money and

550
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
I think for me

551
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,824
Success is the fact that I'm alive and well

552
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,640
I feel like I've already succeeded in South Korea
