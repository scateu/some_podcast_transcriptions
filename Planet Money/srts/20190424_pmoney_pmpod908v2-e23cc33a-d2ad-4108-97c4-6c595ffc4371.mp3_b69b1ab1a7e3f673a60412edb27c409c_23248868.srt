1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,536
In the year 2

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,840
Everybody was signing up for Yahoo email

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:07,168
This was back before Gmail and Yahoo mail is great

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:07,936
It was free

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,472
You can check your email anywhere

6
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,752
But there was this one

7
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:14,848
And a computer science grad student at Carnegie Mellon University

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,408
Became fixated on this problem

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
His name is Luis Von Ahn

10
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,248
The problem was that they were people who

11
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,040
In order to

12
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,368
Send spam from Yahoo accounts they would have been millions of email accounts

13
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,768
Literally millions not not hundreds of thousands but millions of fake email account literally millions of fake email

14
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,352
The spammers who were signing up for millions of spam account

15
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,400
Weren't going to the Yahoo mail page

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,448
And just signing up for these accounts wanted

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,312
It wasn't like they were like the real Jacob Goldstein at yahoo.com Jacob Goldstein

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,360
99 at yahoo.com

19
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,176
Jacob the Barefoot dancer at yahoo.com

20
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,016
No spammers were writing simple computer programs little.

21
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,344
They just kept filling out the Yahoo email sign up form

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,136
Again and again and again

23
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,160
Day and night

24
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,744
And that would generate an army of email accounts that can be used to

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
Tell fake Viagra

26
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,328
Steal your bank account information whatever

27
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
Don't know what to do about

28
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
But Louis Vuitton have an eye

29
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,496
So the idea was can we make a test that can distinguish between humans and computers

30
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,288
But also a test

31
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,336
That is graded by the computer

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,920
Basically ever signed up for anything on the internet

33
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
That you probably know

34
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
The idea that Lewis Vaughn

35
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
A picture of distorted letters in them

36
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
And then a little

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
Field below that pic

38
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
Picture where you type in the characters

39
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,536
And we actually showed it to the the guy with the chief scientist at Yahoo

40
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,352
He loved it and within a few weeks it was actually

41
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,960
In the registration flow of email accounts that Yahoo it was it was being used there

42
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,312
And we were super happy that they were just using it Lewis gave his little tested name

43
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
So long ridiculous

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
Name that made a short

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Genius

46
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,248
The long name was completely automated public

47
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,136
Turing test to tell computers and humans apart is a famous old idea in computer science

48
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,256
It's a test where you try to tell if you're chatting with a computer or with a human being

49
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,608
If a computer can consistently make you think it's a human being

50
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
That is artificial intelligence

51
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,216
And this sort of Turing test that Lewis came up with

52
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
It became huge

53
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,056
You may even know the acronym for this

54
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Capture

55
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Capture

56
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:30,016
Catches very compelling captures a good name cuz it's like capture them or gotcha or something like that

57
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
It was a good name

58
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,576
You know captcha

59
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
Maybe you do not like captcha

60
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,136
And yet

61
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,232
The 20-year history of captcha is this window into a lot

62
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,024
Artificial intelligence

63
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
Into digitizing millions of books also into a little cybercrime

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,008
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob Goldstein and I'm Noel King

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
And I am not a robot

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
I'm not

67
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
Not

68
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
Not a robot

69
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
But if you were

70
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:01,504
That's exactly what I put on the show a global

71
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,088
Decades-long war and internet that people actually use

72
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
Versus a spammy wasteland

73
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
It is computer vs. computer

74
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,024
And in the end the computers are only going to need us the humans

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
To do a little light data entry

76
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,776

Al.com

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,216
I should say that Luis Von Ahn was one of several people working on capture of like

93
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Tests around the same

94
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
So he's not the only person who came up with the idea

95
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
The other people develop their own

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,176
But Lewis and his colleagues are the ones who came up with the name

97
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
And their version was the one that really

98
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,832
When you bought tickets online when you signed up for your MySpace account

99
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
Pretty soon people were taking Luisa's little test

100
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,952
200 million times a day

101
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,280
It was protecting the world from scalpers and spammers and

102
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Bots

103
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
Emma world of course

104
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Responded with gratitude

105
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,471
Every time that I talk to somebody about about captors you know the first thing they would tell me how annoying they are

106
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
So I started feeling

107
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:32,383
Fair fair I started feeling partly responsible for at least you know

108
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,687
20 million times a day

109
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,015
And each time you type on a lazy waste about 10 seconds of your time

110
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,831
So now I started just thinking

111
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,415
Is there any way in which we can make good use of these this 10 seconds

112
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
This was in the

113
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
At this moment there is this

114
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Who's going on

115
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
Digitize old books and old.

116
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:56,191
And at the time it was easy enough to scan old pages on pieces of paper and put them online

117
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
What computers were still bad

118
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
A turning those scanned pages

119
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
Is into useful online.

120
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:07,199
It's not searchable you cannot change the font size you cannot I mean it's just a bunch of kind of

121
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
Summer crappie pictures

122
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,367
So it occurred to me that you could take all of the words of the computer could not recognize

123
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,231
And we get people to read them for us while they were typing capitals on the internet

124
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
Up to this point Lewis has been giving captcha away for free

125
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
But now he thinks

126
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,959
People might pay to have their print archives digitized one captcha at a time

127
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,847
And he is sitting on over half-a-million hours of free human labor a day

128
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,687
So he starts a company called recaptcha and he goes out looking for

129
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,551
And what happened was I was actually giving a talk somewhere

130
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
I was fortunate that

131
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
At the time the guy who was the

132
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,231
Chief Information officer for the New York Times was sitting at the

133
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
And the audience okay and he said you know what

134
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,375
We have this huge do you know hundred and thirty year old Archive of

135
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,959
Old editions of the New York Times so maybe we can maybe you can help us

136
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,031
The New York Times ended up being recaptures first client

137
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,127
Now when you saw the caption next to a few random letters and numbers

138
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:11,967
There was also a picture of a word from an old issue of the times

139
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
The computers couldn't read

140
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,367
When you typed in that word you weren't just protecting the internet from spam

141
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,511
You are also helping to turn a hundred years of old newspapers into a searchable digital archive

142
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
And I have to say I just

143
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
Love this sort of

144
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
While you're doing one thing you're also doing something else

145
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,703
Efficiency of this like it just

146
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
Hit The Lights

147
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Do you know it's like that

148
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,591
The old dream of riding your exercise bike to power the lights in your houses

149
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,687
Something which by the way Louis told me when he was like 11 he had that dream

150
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,247
And then he like looked into it and realized I actually

151
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
Like a person

152
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Exercise bike is a terrible way to die

153
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
As Louis was getting recaptcha going

154
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,231
Google came out and announced that they were starting to digitize every

155
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,815
Book like every single book in the world or

156
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
Basalt Lewis was doing for the time

157
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:07,263
And in 2009 googlebot recaptcha and started using it to help digitize book

158
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,615
And then a few years later Google started using captcha test that showed

159
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,431
Pictures of addresses on the sides of building

160
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,967
When we solve those captured

161
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
We were making Google Maps work

162
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
Work better doing a little more work for

163
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Unpaid

164
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
So that is the end of Louis's caps

165
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Story but a little digression

166
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
He started a language come

167
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767
Where people did online translation

168
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
While they were learning the length

169
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
Same like doing one thing actually do another thing

170
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
This company became super Papi

171
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Killer is called

172
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,263
Duolingo if I take out so popular

173
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
But they got rid of the translation

174
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,615
I know it's just this app that millions of people used to

175
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,687
Okay end of Lewis and of digression

176
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
So now it is the odds

177
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
Enter wild captcha is working

178
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
The spammers are held at Bay

179
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
And then

180
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
Someone figures out a worker

181
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
Shady businesses

182
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
Started showing up online

183
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,047
An offering to break captcha for anybody willing to pay

184
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
Christina is a computer scientist

185
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
Who started looking into these businesses around 2000

186
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,287
And it's one of those things until you actually think I would actually let's go see. See how hard it is to

187
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,639
Define you might think I know this is some shady cybercriminal underground thing

188
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:22,271
But no Google for if you can find a dozen of these Services very competitively priced within all that stuff

189
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
Just wanted to know like

190
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,111
What's even going on here like is it for real

191
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Do the service

192
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Work

193
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
So he was calling

194
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
Decided to act like spammers me they didn't do the spam

195
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,767
But they did more or less

196
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Everything else they built upon

197
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,119
And this part went around the web bumping into cat

198
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
And automatically

199
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,215
Every time the bot hit a captcha test

200
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
It would send it off to one of these services

201
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Is that offers to solve

202
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,127
And what do those services do exactly

203
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
VP

204
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Human being

205
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:54,015
To sit in front of computers all day long and solve one capture after another

206
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,367
So some person sitting in front of a computer gets a captcha from Chris's bought

207
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
Salsa test in a couple

208
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,255
Send it back to Chris's bought which enters the solution into a web page

209
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
And

210
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,351
Yes that is the plain vanilla version just to see like

211
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
Does this work how long does it

212
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
The take

213
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,471
But Chris and his colleagues also had some other question

214
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
So they did something else

215
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
They made up their own captcha test

216
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Defend out to the soul

217
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
Some of those tests just said

218
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
What time is it

219
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
And the answer to those tests

220
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,039
Told them what time zone the people solving a test lived

221
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
They also wanted to know what languages

222
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
What's this song

223
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,439
So they make capsules with weird instructions in lots of different

224
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
Chinese

225
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:38,559
Spanish to Italian Tagalog Portuguese Russian Tamil Dutch

226
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:43,423
Hindi German male Vietnamese Korean Greek Arabic Bengali kannada Klingon in Farsi

227
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
I'm sorry what was the one before Farsi

228
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Klingon

229
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Klingon

230
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
The made-up language from Star Trek

231
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
I mean of course

232
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,967
But they did it because they wanted to just like for the

233
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
Pusha T servers like how far will these cats

234
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Thesaurus go

235
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
There's no way they're going to be able to answer this but

236
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
The answers we saw it showed us

237
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,999
Like a 1% accuracy rate

238
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,071
But it was on something that was so incredibly

239
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
Long of a of a question

240
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,191
That it couldn't have been right by chance so presumably

241
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
One of these captcha solvers

242
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
Recognize that this was playing on

243
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,943
Either new Klingon just because that's what them people know or look it up online and was actually able to success

244
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Leslie solve this

245
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
Couches that was written in Klingon

246
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
You found the greatest

247
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Captcha solver on Earth

248
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:39,231
Yes based on this part of the study not the Klingon part put the languages and the time zones

249
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,095
They figure out that a lot of people seem to be doing this work in Russia China and India

250
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
And they realize

251
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
This is a huge industry

252
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
People have started calling it

253
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
Captcha

254
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
Farming

255
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,847
And it is basically human beings opening the

256
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
Captcha gate

257
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,919
For an army of bots

258
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Captcha Farms

259
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Work

260
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
Usually they were right

261
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
Usually they were very fast

262
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,135
So that so the services were legit I mean they were

263
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,207
Potentially illegal but they did the thing that they said they were

264
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Correct

265
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
Yeah one of the most interesting things about

266
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,863
Cybercrime as a Marketplace is that it works like

267
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Any other

268
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,543
Like business-to-business type Marketplace your reputation is really important there and you're not going to keep your capture

269
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,567
Dissolving business

270
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
In business

271
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,151
Unless you're actually solving those couches

272
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,431
And how much did it cost

273
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
I won

274
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,527
US dollar per thousand captures

275
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,599
I'm so incredibly incredibly inexpensive

276
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
But this is a task that takes a typical human

277
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
In about 15-20

278
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Yes

279
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
But God I mean you really

280
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,351
Feel for the people doing the work

281
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Yes

282
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:49,887
So

283
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
If you are a spammer

284
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,007
These workers will solve captchas for you around the clock

285
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
For a tenth of a penny

286
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
4000

287
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Pet prices

288
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
Obviously like

289
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
Mind breaking Lilo

290
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
But it is still not zero

291
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
I need to steal enough

292
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
Weed out a lot of

293
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
It weeds out you know

294
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,855
People who are just trolls making spam accounts for fun

295
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,207
And people who are just posting garbage comments on a million garbage website

296
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
Hoping to sell a few X

297
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
$2 worth of

298
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
The garbage Prada

299
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
So even with the caption

300
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Farms captchas

301
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,631
Steeler working to block a lot of

302
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
But

303
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
What would happen if you could

304
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
A computer to solve

305
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Then you wouldn't need the farms in a farmer setting

306
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
The price would go to zero

307
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
And the spammers

308
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Could go what

309
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,759
Support for NPR in the following message come from servicenow

310
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
Making the world of work

311
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
Work better for

312
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,367
Their cloud-based plant

313
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
Form and solution

314
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
Deliver digital workflow

315
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
That create great experiences for employees

316
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
And unlock productivity

317
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
For your whole car

318
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,375
Servicenow digitizes the work your people have to

319
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
So they can do the work

320
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
They want

321
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,959
Using technology

322
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,519
How to make people more productive and engaged

323
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Moret servicenow

324
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
No.com

325
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,895
So this thing kept happening for a long time

326
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,735
Where some spammer would program a computer to solve

327
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:12,063
Then the people making captures would make the test harder

328
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
Eventually the test.

329
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
Too hard for human beings to

330
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
2014

331
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Google set all right enough

332
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,791
We are going to completely change the way captchas

333
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
They called it recaptcha version

334
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
And there are two big changes

335
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
First of all they introduced the

336
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
I am not a robot

337
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Checkbox

338
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,847
Which I have always been kind of mystified by cuz I was four

339
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
The robot just check a check

340
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
What I learned

341
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
When I was working on this show is

342
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,831
When you click on that check box that the site sends back a bunch of information

343
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,903
We'll talk more about what that information is a little later in the

344
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,279
But Google takes that information and decides whether it thinks you're person or a robot

345
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
If it's pretty confident that your

346
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
Person you just get that

347
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,863
Keep going on.

348
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,935
But if you think you might be a machine then you have to take

349
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,799
And the test is the second thing that's really different in this new recaptcha

350
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
This is when they start using those tests that said

351
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:12,223
Click on the picture of a cat or click on all of the pictures of a car

352
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
And the reason they made this is

353
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,319
It is much much harder for a computer to

354
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,879
To beat then just distorted pictures of numbers

355
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:24,511
I talked about this with Jason Pollock is he's a computer science Professor who has studied

356
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,351
Send example is that you want a system where you give it up

357
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,911
Picture of a car and it's going to tell you this is a car

358
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,983
But the problem is that you can have

359
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
100 different types of

360
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,871
Cars different angles different colors different shapes

361
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
Different models so

362
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
Expound from Cars

363
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:49,599
Two trucks to both two planes two trees two dogs two animals to humans everything you can imagine

364
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:54,719
Just even you know if we just go back to the beginning of capture right in and around 2,000 dish

365
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,839
Was there any system in the world that could have looked at a

366
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,935
Picture of a glass of wine or a picture of a dog and said that's a glass of wine or that's it

367
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
No not even close

368
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:12,127
In order to get a machine to solve this kind of problem you would need millions of label digital photos of different

369
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
And Incredibly powerful computers

370
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,295
And very very clever software that could take all the photos

371
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
And learn to recognize

372
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
Nice cats and wine and dogs

373
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
As it happened

374
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,767
All of those things happened to come together in the years right before recaptcha version

375
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
Came out you know the web provided millions of labeled image

376
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,399
Just and then computer scientist started using this technique called

377
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,727
Deep learning or machine learning but essentially trained

378
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
Powerful computers

379
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,823
Deep learning or machine learning

380
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
This is me the biggest behind the scenes

381
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
Technological innovation of the last

382
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
20 years

383
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,807
Impact today a lot of the time when people talk about AI artificial intelligence

384
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
This is what they're talkin about

385
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,903
It's essential to the progress of a lot of things

386
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
Take autonomous cars

387
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,047
This is how a car can see a kid running into the street and hit the brakes

388
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
And it's not just images

389
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,375
Researchers have used other dataset

390
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
Teach computers to recognize

391
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
It's fraud

392
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727
To translate languages

393
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,543
Understand human speech and like a million other

394
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,871
So when is new recaptcha version 2 came out

395
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,991
Immediately thought I want to see if I can use these new machine Learning System

396
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
To break this new recaptcha

397
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,599
Simple I guess he's not a machine learning expert

398
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
And that is actually sort of

399
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
The point

400
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
Because by this time machine learning had progressed so much that you didn't have to be an expert to use it there were these

401
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:40,959
Basically off-the-shelf machine learning systems that anybody would like a medium amount of technical knowledge could use

402
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
Extra pieces

403
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
Entrance room up against

404
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
Take a break recap show with

405
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
And it worked

406
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
I'm not a machine learning person

407
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,711
So the fact that

408
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
Machines have reached that point

409
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,831
And are that good at pass to me it's mind-blowing

410
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,903
Placas publishes a paper about his project in 2006

411
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,511
And other researchers are doing the same thing we beat recap should we be recap

412
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Of course Google knows this is

413
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
In fact

414
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,935
Google itself is doing all this work in machine learning they know better than

415
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
Anybody in the world Maybe

416
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
That machine learning is

417
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
Is just going to keep getting better and better at solving

418
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:24,479
Aaron malenfant runs the recaptcha engineering team at Google so if this is anyone's problem it is his

419
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,391
One day a couple years ago he was telling his boss about all the things that his team was trying to do to stay ahead of the Bots

420
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
But eventually you had to break it

421
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,487
Pretty soon the Bots are going to be able to

422
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
How to solve any kind of captured

423
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Anytime

424
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
I mentioned to her that

425
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Nginx

426
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
325 years

427
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
The current challenges are no longer going to be working

428
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,055
We need to move to a new system

429
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,359
And so she turned to me and just

430
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Ask me

431
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
Why aren't you doing that

432
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
So he did

433
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,503
Aaron and his team started building a new kind of Ra

434
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
Where there is no test

435
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
At all

436
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,647
No letters no pictures no street signs

437
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,463
Apart from a little notice at the bottom of a web page

438
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
You don't even know recaptcha

439
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,839
Google just released it last year so websites are still in the process of

440
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,863
The switching over

441
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,215
It's called recaptcha V3 version 3 reasonably enough

442
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,359
The way it works is you go to a website and Google analyzes your behavior and then sends a score to the web

443
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
And that score is

444
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
Probability that

445
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
You are human too

446
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,271
And then it's up to the website what

447
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,415
Maybe they make you login again if you're submitting a comment or review maybe they sent it to moderation

448
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
So that's

449
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
Like the steps of what

450
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
But there is this

451
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Black Box

452
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
Right which is

453
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:46,399
What's going on in the background how is Google decided whether or not I'm a robot

454
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,727
We know a little bit about how this worked in version 2 when you

455
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
You click the checkbox

456
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,335
In that case Google looked at whether you had visited Google sites

457
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
I whether you were logged into a Google account

458
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,479
And also and this part was almost entirely see

459
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
Google did some kind of analysis

460
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
Based on what you did on that

461
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,623
Page like

462
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,183
You know maybe it had to do with how you move the mouse

463
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,255
It's like this black boxes of course you know

464
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,791
The most interesting thing to me

465
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:18,655
So when I was talking to Aaron about this new recaptcha about version 3 I I just said like

466
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
What can you tell me about what you're doing to decide whether

467
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
So

468
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
What

469
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,591
What's public about the

470
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
The way in which you're making that risks

471
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
Yasso

472
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
The reason we don't say too much is that we do have

473
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
Adversary is trying to beat us at all

474
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:41,439
We do say publicly that we adapt

475
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
To a particular site and

476
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
Behavior for that site

477
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
And when I say

478
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,119
We don't mean people I mean the machine looks at it

479
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,399
And decides

480
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Is this

481
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Request

482
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,287
Expected for this website does it

483
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,359
Look like other good requests

484
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Asus website

485
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
In other words

486
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
For every site that installs recaptcha version 3

487
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
Google's computer

488
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,063
Using machine learning

489
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,135
Analyze specific behavior for that website

490
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,463
And then every time a user comes to that website they say

491
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,559
Is this user doing what a person normally does on this site or are they acting weird

492
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
And this is a big change cuz you know in the sort of recaptcha world that were used to there's like a few diff

493
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Different kinds of

494
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,311
And if you could build a bot that could pass those tests

495
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
Then you could get through

496
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,639
Any recaptcha on any web

497
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
Looks like you had the keys to all the locks

498
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
Now with version 3

499
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,319
It's like Google is making a different lock for every single

500
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
This means that if

501
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,999
Just because you can get a good score on the website if you're an attacker doesn't mean that you can get a good score on a

502
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
All the websites

503
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
I get that

504
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
That makes sense

505
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,375
I mean if that's all true

506
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,727
Does it matter at all env3 whether I am

507
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,335
Login to Google or have a Gmail account or any of that is that even relevant for 4

508
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
How you analyze the risk

509
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
I would say it matters a lot less

510
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
A lot less than what

511
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Then used

512
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
Okay

513
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
Okay goal is that it doesn't matter

514
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
That's your that's your ndk

515
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Right

516
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824
We're not there yet

517
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Getting there

518
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,152
Well I had a knife in Taiwan

519
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
I probably already said too much

520
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,272
A few days after I talked to Aaron a Google spokesman got into

521
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,088
And was able to tell me a little bit more of

522
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
What he said was

523
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,208
Whether or not a user has an active Google account

524
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,232
That matters

525
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Google's risk

526
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:57,888
But recaptcha does not use any information about what the user does on

527
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Is a hurricane

528
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
So they're not looking at like

529
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,496
How often you send emails or browse YouTube

530
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
It's just

531
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Do you have an account

532
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:09,152
For all of the secrecy and the cleverness in this new kind of captcha

533
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,480
It's still a computer deciding who is a human

534
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,808
But now the captcha test isn't just in a little box

535
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
At the bottom of the page

536
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,392
The test is everything you do on

537
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,744
So when the spammers computers figure out how to break this week

538
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,352
And if there's one thing we learned is that somebody somewhere will break it some

539
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,168
The computers won't just be solving a little

540
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,240
The spammers computers will be imitating

541
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
Everything

542
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568

Today Show was produced by Alexi Horowitz Ghazi and

550
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:12,384
Liza Yeager it was edited by Brian First Step family senior producer is Alex Goldman

551
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,224
I'm Jacob and thanks for listening

552
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,600
I have failed many many captured

553
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:28,768
It comforted when our producer Lexi found these videos on YouTube of people losing their mind

554
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Overcapture

555
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Okay so apparently

556
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
I am incapable

557
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,448
Of identifying street signs

558
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Intel

559
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Now that's not it

560
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,800
Is a street sign

561
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,408
It's on the street and it's a sign is that a bus

562
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
I think it's a truck

563
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
But it could be a bus

564
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Bus

565
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,320
Bus bus are there any more cars

566
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
There are right

567
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
Right

568
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,416
Wrong

569
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,232
And now Google throws a foe at you that you've never seen

570
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,000
Before Road

571
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,584
Is that a storefront incredibly

572
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,680
Did someone drunk make this capture the traffic light

573
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,728
I need felicis

574
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,776
Apparently I'm just wrong

575
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,312
I'm not a robot

576
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
I'm not
