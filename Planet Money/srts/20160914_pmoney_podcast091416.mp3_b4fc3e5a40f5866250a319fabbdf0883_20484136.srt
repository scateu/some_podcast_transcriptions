Last year on Valentine's Day Fred Rocco was sitting on his couch at his house in Upstate New York

9
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,600
And his wife Natasha was playing the piano

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
3 planes

11
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
Something she made up

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:35,072
Sometimes I just sit there and let my fingers go and see what Tunes melodies come out

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
Red Lobster

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,608
I love them

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,240
Actually paying that much attention to the music he was paying attention to this new little kitten that they

16
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
They got so who is this

17
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,336
So she can introduce yourself with this is Yoda

18
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,872
Hey Kitty we say something

19
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,480
At some point I'm going to have to get Yoda to meow

20
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:56,064
Got to get the some of the cat radio when I want to try to meow

21
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
We'll get to that

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,392
Anyway friends playing with

23
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,208
The kitten and he takes little toy mouse that Yoda has a

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,512
Throws it across the room and it slides across

25
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,328
The floor and they have a rug that's a little bit Rumple.

26
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
And the mouse slides across the

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,424
Right into one of the little rumbles in the rug

28
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
The cat

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Goes

30
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Bananas

31
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,640
And she immediately attacked it just ran and started putting her paws underneath then playing with it and

32
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:26,272
Fred 70s that there was said we going to make the Ripple rug and I looked at Fred I said what you mean what's the Ripple rug

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Ripple rug

34
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
The Ripple rug

35
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
The Ripple rug is a cat

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,904
It is basically the size

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
7 doormat

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,976
I'm here Robert in the show you

39
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
The Ripple rug this is it

40
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
This is

41
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
The rebel ride

42
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,912
I don't know how to describe describe it looks like someone's taking a carpet

43
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,984
They've cut holes into it so it looks like swiss cheese and then they have

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
Wadded-up

45
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
The carpet

46
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
Turn on the floor

47
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,944
Yeah that's essentially the revelry apparently Disneyland for

48
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,016
A year later Natasha and Fred are selling

49
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
$60,000

50
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
Ripple rug every month

51
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
David on Today Show

52
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
They have set up a shop

53
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,952
Open Amazon Marketplace

54
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Sunprime

55
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,560
And the Ripple rug was one of Amazon's best-selling pet toys

56
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
Three 999

57
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
And then one day Fred gets this

58
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Missed call from him

59
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,056
My brother-in-law's like hey did you see it's on eBay cuz he's always looking at stuff on eBay

60
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
And I was like what

61
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,384
Fred Goes immediately to his computer logs

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
EBay I just typed in the Ripple rug and there was already for sellers selling the Ripple rug and then every single

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
All day there would be five more six more

64
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
10 more

65
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
How much were they charging

66
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,720
They were going as high as 5999

67
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
That's

68
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,304
$20 more than he was selling them for on Amazon

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,608
Beastly people were scalping Ripple

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,704
Buying them on Amazon and selling them on eBay at a market

71
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,056
All these people who read a Natasha never met

72
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,104
We're getting rich off of their invention

73
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:00,480
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith Robert Smith

74
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
The internet was supposed to get rid

75
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,136
Of the middleman that's what they told us consumers were supposed to buy directly from manufacturers

76
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
No more going to people like

77
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,464
Travel agents having to pay fees

78
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,536
Internet was going to be about getting stuff from the source

79
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
For a wholesale price

80
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,864
It did not work out that way

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Just ask the makers of

82
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
The Ripple rug

83
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,496
The internet has made it so that anyone can be a middleman

84
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
Or a middle person

85
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
Middle person doesn't sound as good as middle man

86
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,944

By visiting blueapron.com planet

98
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
Winford Rocco saw all of these

99
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
People selling the Ripple rug on eBay

100
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
He went a little nuts

101
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,327
He started spending hours everyday checking eBay and

102
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Try to get in touch

103
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
The people who are selling his cattle

104
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
Did you ever try to contact any of the

105
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
Mittleman

106
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,591
I have reached out to many of them I've sent cease-and-desist orders to every single one of them

107
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Well hello

108
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
One of them stop

109
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,735
Yes the letters did not work and then Fred started tracking down their phone number

110
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
And personally calling

111
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,159
I am Fred from snuggly cat the makers of the Ripple rug and calling you about you selling our product illegal alien

112
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
You know I'm not selling it illegally

113
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
Well I mean

114
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
BB guns for probably right there's nothing illegal about buying something and reselling it there's even a name for it would use the

115
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
Arbitrage Arbitrage memes

116
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
You buy something cheap in one place

117
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
You sell it expensive another

118
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Yes but this is a

119
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Twist on Arbitrage

120
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Call drops

121
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
And it's kind of

122
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
Genius because there is

123
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
Basically no risk involved it all

124
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,343
These people never bought a ripple in their closet

125
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
And then sold it

126
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
They never actually

127
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Touch the Ripple rug

128
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
They just

129
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
Wait until a customer buys

130
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
The Ripple rug from them

131
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,583
And then they buy it from the Amazon store

132
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,887
And ship it directly from Amazon

133
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
To the customer

134
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
And the customers

135
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
Have no idea where the River Run

136
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Comes from all I know is they paid

137
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,127
$60 instead of $40 and the Ripple rug showed up they thought it came from

138
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Whoever made it

139
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,223
Exactly and the dropshipper can just pocket the difference

140
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
Okay it is easy to resent

141
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
People who have found a way to make some

142
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Easy money

143
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:50,463
This is good for Fred this is good for Fred and Natasha and for the Ripple rug

144
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
Because this

145
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,815
Fleet of middleman whoever they are there advertising

146
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
The product

147
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,167
And yeah they're adding money to order debated making a profit but they act

148
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
It's the sort of

149
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
We have sales people

150
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Out there pushing Ripple rug

151
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
Getting into people's hands

152
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
Yes they don't actually do any of the work

153
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
But they're making more sales

154
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,199
But Fred says there are a couple of problems

155
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,783
The first is that he is trying to build a brand

156
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855
It's not just about selling one ripplerock it's about building the snuggle

157
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Cat brand so part of

158
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
A luxury cat toys

159
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,999
Price is a big part of

160
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,327
Branding and so he wants to control his Brandy wants to control the prices

161
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
She doesn't want people selling it for all kinds of

162
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,727
But the real problem was that he says he was losing money

163
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Because what was happening

164
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
Is people were ordering this product on eBay

165
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,383
And the Box showing up at their doorstep was from Amazon

166
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,991
Two people get confused they would look up the product on Amazon and they would realize

167
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
They had paid $20 more

168
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
For the Ripple rug then they needed to pay

169
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,183
And so they would think I'm just going to return it to eBay and

170
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Order from Amazon

171
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,767
Let's say you feel cheated you say I want to return it cuz

172
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
It's 3999

173
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Honey you know Amazon for real

174
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,935
I paid 5990. They're both free shipping and free returns

175
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
I'll return this one order from there

176
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
But you're not returning the product

177
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
To the middleman

178
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
The people I mean by you're really returning the product

179
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Back to friends

180
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,711
And that comes with a whole boatload of fees of

181
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,527
Apparently so Amazon charges fees all along the way they have a fever

182
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
For the purchase of

183
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
Before shipping if you for

184
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
For the return if

185
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Restocking

186
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,671
And then when the customer reorders from Amazon

187
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
There's another

188
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Another

189
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,559
Sprint has a lot of times the rugs with comeback used

190
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
So he had to

191
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
Destroy that he couldn't

192
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
Resell them

193
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
And just two months after

194
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
Fred noticed all of these

195
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
Dropshippers on eBay

196
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
He said he had over 200

197
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
Which was over 10000 losses in

198
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,383
Just a couple of months

199
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,967
You lost $10,000 in 2 months into months

200
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
Meanwhile the eBay people

201
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
All the people who are charging $60 for

202
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,879
This pocketing the extra $20 different

203
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
They get to keep the money

204
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
Yeah they're not paying any of the

205
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
The genius

206
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,535
Do you want me to go first you can go first

207
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,095
Okay I'm alright though hello my name is Nikki with a

208
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,143
Hello my name is Paris Witherspoon

209
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,471
Nicky and Paris are dropshippers I talk to them on Skype

210
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
And they said he never sold the Ripple rug

211
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,359
But they do sell tons of cat toys and household products and

212
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Supplies and all kinds of

213
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
And what's make any of those things

214
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
They don't have possession of those things

215
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
Mark up the price

216
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
And send them on to

217
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
The customer

218
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
That is what they do

219
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,183
America got started in this business when they were both living in Baghdad

220
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,743
In Iraq they were working for private contractors

221
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,559
And they were spending all of their time

222
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Buying stuff online

223
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
You know groceries and household type stuff

224
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Furniture

225
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
We bought a car online

226
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,311
We bought a house online we bought a dog online

227
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
Cuba

228
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,431
Adam Schiff

229
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:55,039
Legend ship from Oklahoma to Iraq we sure did that wasn't

230
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:00,671
Nicky and Paris are very familiar with buying things online and they decide to give dropshipping

231
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
A try

232
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
Sign up for the company called

233
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,047
DS Domination PS4 Dropship

234
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Exactly

235
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,679
And think it's software that helps them find these best selling products on Amazon

236
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,983
Copy the images from Amazon

237
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
Apple store on eBay

238
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,079
And figure out how much to charge for these

239
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
These products if they're dropped

240
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
They start out selling mostly.

241
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Toys and novel

242
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,271
The items and almost right away Nikki says she realizes

243
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
This is going to be

244
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Be a big

245
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
I'll never forget it it was like an Angry Birds Star Wars set that we had got and it it took off in

246
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
In less than 48 hours

247
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
I mean you just kind of sit back and you're like

248
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
I just paid

249
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,471
$0.30 for this item and it's sold were like 9 bucks

250
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,031
About 30 times today

251
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
You know

252
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
It was just an amazing feeling

253
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
Answer me this

254
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,199
Prophet I mean just in that one day they made you know what

255
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
60 bucks

256
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
Yeah nothing yeah

257
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,367
And after just a few months of this they were making enough money that they were both able to

258
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
Quit their jobs in Iraq

259
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
And move back to the US

260
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
To Houston

261
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,791
And now they say they make more than a million dollars a year in sales

262
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
Dave

263
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
McDonald's

264
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
Well they've expanded into a whole bunch of other thing

265
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
Wholesaling now and

266
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
Private label stuff but

267
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,103
Nikki told me they will never stop doing the drop ship

268
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
It's just it's just too easy

269
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,759
Portsmouth. Some some tools in there that kind of automate everything

270
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,623
Really just a matter of pressing a button and your store is kind of ran for you

271
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
So

272
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:41,791
You know that that's profit that you know if it's that easy to do why would we not keep it you know

273
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
Did you ever feel like

274
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,631
We're not actually doing anything we're just

275
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
Gorgeous charging to

276
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,983
Post-it you don't even like you're not adding anything to the product

277
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Anything like that

278
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
Did you feel weird about that

279
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
Not not really honestly

280
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,223
You know when you're actually doing it it does require some work you're having to do the tracking

281
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,063
You know I'm a say for instance if Amazon is is out of her

282
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
A particular item

283
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
I'm get to go to an actual retail location grab that item put in the Box make sure your customer gets it you're doing all the cuss

284
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,815
Customer service you're making sure that that customer is happy

285
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
There's no issues with it

286
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
Control

287
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,215
If you're doing the whole thing

288
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
When you put it that way

289
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
They sound like a retail

290
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
They sound like a retail store that wants

291
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
Customers to return

292
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
And even though they don't make

293
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
The products are

294
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Or even really even

295
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
Touch the products

296
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
They're the public face

297
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Of the prompt

298
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
Yeah in a lot of ways retailers are

299
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Just middle man

300
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
But to frighten

301
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
Natasha the cat rug makers

302
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
Guys on the internet or just scalp

303
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
They were making the product a lot more expensive

304
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
For customers

305
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
They were not adding anything to it

306
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,935
Jason feifer is the editor-in-chief of Entrepreneur magazine

307
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
He wrote about the Ruffles and

308
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
If there's a bad guy in this story

309
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
Really

310
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
It's us

311
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
What know it's us

312
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
Have you ever bought anything on eBay

313
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Yes

314
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Did you ever

315
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
Think where it came from

316
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,927
No seller the seller right where it came from

317
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
That mentality

318
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Create this opportunity for

319
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,559
Still with our fault because

320
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:24,447
We aren't shopping around because we're not searching for the original Ripple rug at the original $40

321
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,007
Exactly we don't want to look around on the internet

322
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
That's so the middleman or saving us a couple

323
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
Keystrokes few seconds here and there

324
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Yeah and we are willing to

325
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,711
To pay for that $5 10 dollars $20 we are paying for that

326
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
All I have to do is go

327
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
To another website

328
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
NC

329
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
The price is Jeff

330
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
And I don't

331
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
It's crazy like why am I not doing that

332
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
I mean

333
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,231
As long as we are all willing

334
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
To be taken advantage of by

335
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Different Market

336
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,375
Two places even though we have all the information in front of us

337
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:57,215
It would literally take five seconds

338
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
And we don't do it

339
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,055
So if we're not going to do it

340
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,871
Why can't people take advantage of us

341
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
We are the problem

342
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
Just gets to something

343
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,551
Because although economic treat us like economically rational beings always

344
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
Hunting for the best price

345
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
The truth is

346
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
We are all deeply lazy

347
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
And

348
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,999
There's always someone who will help us

349
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Be a little bit lazier

350
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
For a profit

351
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,655
And I guess it's always with all that little one-click shopping the internet has made us

352
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Lazier

353
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,751
And it's simultaneously created all these opportunities for

354
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,359
For people to jump in and make things even easier but to take a little slice of the profiteering

355
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Exactly

356
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
Keystrokes and Charters little more

357
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
Michael Munger is an economist at Duke

358
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,319
He has been studying the middleman for years

359
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,927
All you have to do is have a computer with a connection to the internet the ability to write code

360
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,767
And you can be a middleman it's the most competitive industry the world has ever known

361
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Being a middleman

362
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,887
Being a middleman that's what people all over the world want to do

363
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
I want to write an app

364
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,823
That will sell and I'll make a lot of money but the app itself can't make any good or service all I can do is

365
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Bring together

366
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:11,199
A buyer and a seller who otherwise wouldn't have met that's the essence of being a middleman

367
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,783
Think about it a lot of the hottest companies in the world right now are

368
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
Essentially just middlemen

369
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,391
Yeah and we don't even think of them as middleman right or I'm going to get an Uber

370
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
That's what I say I'm going to Uber so a car is going

371
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,767
Uber all over is a middleman

372
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Between me

373
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
Add a driver they don't own any car

374
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
Cars they don't employ any drivers

375
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,191
They just take a slice of profit for connecting the two of us

376
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
Same with Airbnb

377
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Kayak

378
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
EBay and Amazon

379
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
Alibaba all just

380
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
Mittleman

381
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
So

382
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
The future of the economy is really

383
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
Becoming more and more about

384
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Middleman

385
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Getting

386
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
People much much much more efficiently

387
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
2

388
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,415
Goods and services

389
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
You're not going far enough

390
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
It's about almost nothing else

391
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
It's more middlemen

392
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
Good

393
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
That's like asking is gravity good

394
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
You're comparing middlemont to gravity

395
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:08,543
I'm comparing the economic logic of selling reductions in transaction

396
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
Irresistible inevitable

397
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,943
So inevitable but even middlemen are worried

398
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
About middle

399
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
No

400
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,319
Nikki and Parish Witherspoon the Amazon to eBay drops

401
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
Chippers would not even give me the name of their store on

402
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,767
Because they were worried that someone would go to their store copy all the items they were selling

403
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,559
Set up their own store

404
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
And sell them for a little bit less

405
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:36,447
People that are lazy will go in instead of doing the research like we did

406
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
We'll just go and take what you having

407
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
You start selling it

408
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,847
They're not going to have to do the work that you did to go research the item

409
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,175
Dropshipping way I thought like the whole

410
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
Is that the whole thing

411
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
Absolutely it

412
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,855
It is absolutely it's not for you to call

413
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Copy other people

414
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,671
Right right that's what I was

415
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
But their whole business is copying other people

416
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
Yes but they said that they know things they gotten

417
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,375
Really good at their business with yours and they don't want somebody stealing your ideas

418
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,959
Middle men are like gravity they're just inevitable

419
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,287
If there's any little bit of profit left on the table somewhere

420
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Someone is going to grab

421
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
There is one man who has decided to fight

422
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
To fight the middleman

423
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
Fred Ruckel

424
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
Are Ripple rug maker

425
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,271
He was spending hours a day

426
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Trying to shut down

427
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Dropshippers

428
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:31,231
First thing in the morning check for arbitrageurs last thing at night check for Arbitrage you send out any cease-and-desist before or after

429
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,327
It was taking up enormous amount of time and it was a super stressful

430
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,887
A couple months ago red did something

431
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Drastic

432
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,239
Keep hold the Ripple rug off of the Amazon Prime Market

433
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,823
No more free Prime shipping Amazon store

434
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
That is where the Arbitrage

435
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,455
We pulled out of the hole in Prime shipping thing in May

436
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,783
And at that point we were over 60000 a month in sales

437
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
And in a blink

438
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
60000 went down

439
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
$25

440
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,927
Oh my gosh

441
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
That's a big price you paid

442
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,999
I would say it was a huge price

443
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
Is it worth it

444
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
Well we had put together

445
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,191
Really that's all I mean that's so much money that's like

446
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,471
Integrity is important

447
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,335
Stress Factory trust so we removed all the stress

448
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
Bread and Atasha started doing all of their own ship

449
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
And they converted their garage in

450
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
A little pack

451
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
Gotten really good with those

452
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Envelopes

453
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
And then I before I saw them they both been up in

454
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Until midnight

455
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,487
A video had gone up online with a couple of

456
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:40,351
Cat celebrities minor cat celebrities named Cole and marmalade playing on a ripple rug

457
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
An orders had been pouring in

458
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:48,543
And so we spent two hours each packing last night and then this morning we spent another two hours each packing

459
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
Let's meat hours

460
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
For one person right there

461
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687
Camp so this isn't make you wish slightly that you were still

462
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
Using Amazon zuoz shipping

463
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,039
People would be arbitraging our products

464
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
It seems like

465
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Everybody's

466
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Losing out of

467
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,975
Brenda Tasha are losing money they not selling it

468
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
Beat the dropshippers the arbitrageurs

469
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,351
They're not making as much money reselling these things

470
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
And their product

471
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
Which seems like a great product

472
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,823
Is harder to get cats everywhere are suffering because Freddy Natasha won't just suck it

473
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
Shut up and deal with the middleman

474
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
All of that is true

475
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
But there's an emotional component

476
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
And Fred and Natasha invented this

477
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
This River Rock

478
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Lisa a lot of ownership

479
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
Foreign to them

480
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
It felt like people were coming in

481
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
And taking like a bite out of

482
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
The Sting main event

483
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
Essentially

484
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
Stealing there Prada

485
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,071
And for free that I just wanted

486
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,655
Control back they didn't want to be up at night and up in the morning trying to

487
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
Pull their products back from all these

488
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,471
Forces

489
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,823
They just wanted total control van end the loss of money they told me it was worth it today

490
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,407
Now for the Natasha are mostly selling Ripple rugs Direct

491
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,991
Website and they told me sales are starting to come back after

492
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
For the initial

493
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Big drop off

494
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,087
And they were very pleased to say

495
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
In the last 4 months

496
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
They have only had

497
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,791
To return

498
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,655

Kitty kitty kitty

501
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:31,199
We reached out to both Amazon and eBay Amazon did not get back to us

502
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,759
EBay did respond saying that dropshipping

503
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,295
Is not against its rule
