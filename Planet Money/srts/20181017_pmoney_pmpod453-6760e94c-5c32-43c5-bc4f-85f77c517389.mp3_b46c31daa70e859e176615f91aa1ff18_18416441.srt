00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,864
Hey just a heads up this episode originally aired in April 2013

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,936
10 years ago Charlie Wheeling with living entry

3
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,984
And his wife faced a

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,008
Classic dilemma

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,848
They're trying to figure out where to send their daughter to

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,968
And then we got wind that there was a Chicago Public School in our neighborhood

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,112
That was doing some interesting things and that seemed like it would be a great place to send our oldest daughter to school

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,672
Seems like an easy choice but

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
Charlie was raised out in the suburbs

10
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,536
The people in the suburbs of Chicago

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,584
The city's public school system

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,864
Seems like a horror

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
A terrible place to

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,704
Tell my mother I think the best

15
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,360
Metaphor I could offer is it she was stricken to the point that she kind of had to lie on a couch with a compressor head

16
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,944
At the prospect of her grandchildren her beloved grandchildren

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,272
Spending their formative years in a Chicago Public School

18
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,576
The Charlie really was teaching public policy

19
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,112
University of Chicago

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,208
Wish we had when we were having fights with our parents

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,488
Access to data

22
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
Minecraft

23
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,608
And Charlie started to tell his mother that she was falling prey

24
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
To one of the

25
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Days of Our Time

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Sherpas

27
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,240
Chicago Public School System might have

28
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Lower test scores

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
Higher Dropout rates

30
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
Private schools are

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Even schools in suburbs

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
But that doesn't mean

33
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Chicago Pub

34
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
Book school system

35
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
Caught

36
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
The high dropout rate

37
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
The important

38
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Sing

39
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,392
And figure out whether a school is good not good somewhere between

40
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,952
Is how much value is added

41
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,512
The kids who walk in the front door

42
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:41,376
And in Suburban areas and in public schools and some charter schools

43
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,192
The kids who walk in the front door

44
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,288
Have motivated Highly Educated affluent parents

45
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,176
So those kids are going to do very well no matter what happens and in the Chicago public schools had a really tough demography

46
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,992
XO they walked in the front door with a lot of disadvantages

47
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
This argument Charlie was having with his mom

48
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
Is over this

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
Really basic question

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,160
That we all struggle with all the time whether we know it or not

51
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
That basic question

52
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
What causes what

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Human brain is really

54
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,840
Program to answer this question const

55
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
This is

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
How we have survived

57
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
Do dominate this planet right

58
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
What made that noise

59
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
Bear made

60
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
What caused my hand

61
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
Fire caused my hand

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,128
We're so eager to figure out what causes

63
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:24,896
What

64
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
That we often get it wrong

65
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,248
Oh I wear my lucky hat to the game and my team won

66
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
So I am never

Charlie wheeler you may know him as the author of the book called naked economics

95
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
We've talked about it

96
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
Before the show

97
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
Charlie has a new book out it's called

98
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
Naked status

99
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
O'Charley's

100
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,504
Choose the title naked statistics of the people wouldn't really notice

101
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Part of fix

102
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
We did in fact I did a book signing at Hanover and I saw a woman walking out of the store with 50 Shades of Grey

103
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
And naked statistics

104
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
Tide pod okay

105
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,840
She may be sorely disappointed with one or the other

106
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,656
Soak the book sort of covers a lot of ground in

107
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:56,288
Statistics we're not going to try and cover it all today we're really going to focus on this one thing on this one question

108
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
What causes what really

109
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:03,968
This question is at the core of how everybody makes all kinds of decisions I mean if you think about it

110
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,760
Every decision the government makes

111
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,320
Every decision a parent makes with their kid

112
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
Almost any decision you can think of

113
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Trying to

114
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
Call some out

115
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
Come

116
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,744
Statistics can be very helpful in trying to fit

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
Figure out what causes what

118
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
But as you show in the book

119
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Statistics can also

120
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:20,863
Totally

121
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Screw you over

122
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,935
Yeah we wanted to start with a specific example

123
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
In the book Charlie and a really serious issue which is

124
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
The older women especially after menopause

125
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
They have an increased risk

126
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
A certain disease

127
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
Are quartz researchers

128
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
I said they wanted to look at

129
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
The tells what happened

130
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,319
Well there was a huge longitudinal study

131
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,647
It was a study of nurses over many many years decades

132
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
It was found that women

133
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
As they approach menopause

134
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
Who were given hormone replacement therapy which is estrogen

135
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:56,447
Had lower rates of heart disease and other diseases that are prominent killers of women

136
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
Bandito

137
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:03,103
This wasn't just a random connection this wasn't boy people wearing purple shoes have less click cancer

138
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,663
There was at least some biological

139
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,783
Cooperation early set theory that would make sense which is look what happens as you age is a woman

140
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
Your estrogen levels go down

141
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,183
We're seeing this association between lower estrogen and bad outcomes

142
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,327
So then estrogen therapy if it shows that has positive effects on things like heart disease

143
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
Would appear to be

144
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
A beneficial strategy

145
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,751
And this was like a big serious study I mean this was done

146
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
By Harvard

147
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
People looked at it there's a large sample

148
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:38,175
Full-sized and Doctor saw this and they said well if there is a correlation between reduced

149
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Risk of disease

150
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Can estrogen

151
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
We're going to start

152
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Prescribing

153
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Estrogen

154
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
Ritemed Medical Center

155
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,671
To get the point where not only were doctors comfortable prescribing estrogen

156
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,487
Thousands and thousands of women it be kind of

157
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,791
Became what you did when you got older

158
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,119
But there was even a movement to start giving estrogen to men

159
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Now scientists look

160
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
Bissonet sad

161
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,751
There may be

162
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
Correlation between taking f

163
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Estrogen heavy reduced

164
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
Heart disease but there could be a lot of

165
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Other

166
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,919
Doctors here maybe the people who are

167
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
More likely to go to the doctor and ask

168
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
For estrogen

169
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Argent

170
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
Healthier people

171
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
Maybe there are other reasons we don't know about

172
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Did something

173
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,927
Scientist do all the time and it's called a randomized trial

174
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
Explain what they did

175
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
They took another large group of women

176
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,095
And they randomly assign them to one of two groups

177
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,935
Just like your seventh grade science project the treatment group or the control group

178
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
And one group got the estrogen

179
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
The other group did not

180
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
And what they found was

181
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Was really scary

182
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,151
Scary and tragic they found that the opposite

183
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,431
Appears to be true which is

184
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
Did the women who got estrogen therapy

185
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,831
In this controlled experiment actually had higher rates

186
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,183
Of heart attack stroke breast cancer and other things that were quite damaging

187
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,999
And then when they looked back at the number of women

188
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
Who has been prescribed estrogen

189
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
They assumed

190
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,655
That thousands of women most likely had

191
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,215
These events or died prematurely

192
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,567
Because of what had been really fundamentally a correlation

193
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:15,711
And not a causal relationship and it's actually said there was a causal relationship we went the other direction that estrogen was actually bad for the help

194
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
And this is obviously a pretty girl

195
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
Large particular

196
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
Tragic case of

197
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
Can correlation and

198
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,207
Mistakenly thinking that there is causation

199
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
This kind of error

200
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,839
It happens all the time it happens everywhere I mean when we talk about

201
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
A lot of the show

202
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
The stock market

203
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
50 Cent we talk about the stock market

204
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Market you know that

205
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
The daily moves the stock market is up

206
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
Today or down today

207
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103
Basically every news story about the stock market if it's up

208
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,175
They just find some correlation find some good news

209
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
Assume that that good news

210
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
Is causing it to go up

211
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
On the same day if the stock market went down they would find some other news

212
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
Assume that bad news

213
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
Causing it to go down

214
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
Yeah let me give it a thousand things are having

215
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
So

216
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,607
I read a story not long ago in the Wall Street Journal the admittedly was a little tongue-in-cheek but

217
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
In the run-up to the Masters it pointed out

218
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:12,287
That when Tiger Woods was winning tournaments the Dow Jones Industrial Average

219
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Consistently did better

220
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,919
Well that I should be tracking his golf scores and

221
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Watch

222
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
The Masters another tournament

223
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
It's at you know with your broker on the line

224
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
And of course that is

225
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Clearly

226
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Just correlation

227
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
And I feel like

228
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,743
When we make this jump when we want to go from finding correlation

229
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
Actually figuring out

230
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
Causes

231
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
That's when we sort of

232
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Get to the edge of

233
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Statistics right it seems like

234
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,471
Statistics is amazing at figuring out correlations and even

235
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
You don't getting rid of

236
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
Extraneous variables in whatever

237
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,127
As far as I can tell statistics on its own is not enough

238
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
To get us to cause a

239
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
To get the causation

240
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,271
Stupid people for studying this stuff ultimately need to

241
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Come up with

242
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Clever trick

243
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
Eternally in your book you have

244
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
A number of experiments that Reese

245
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Done

246
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
To get to this

247
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,023
Question of what causes white and it wasn't love was about

248
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Crime

249
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,631
And especially crime in in DC in the district

250
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Columbia

251
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
This is cute policy question about

252
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Cops

253
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
And crime if you just

254
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Ian Moore

255
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Will crime go down

256
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,639
And it's really hard to tease out because obviously high-crime cities

257
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Have an incentive

258
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
To hire a lot of cops

259
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,295
And so the date is really messy but you describe a way in which they

260
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Figured out

261
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
This probably figured out in the desert

262
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Columbia

263
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
Right so

264
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
There were some very clever researchers

265
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
And I said well we need to find

266
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,047
An example

267
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
Where we get a lot of police

268
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
For reasons unrelated to Crime now that

269
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,543
We would think of the relatively rare occurrence why the world would you create a lot of police we didn't have a lot of crime

270
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,615
And they happened upon in this is what great researchers do

271
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
The terrorism alert

272
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,247
System so you get all those colors orange red whatever else they are

273
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
By law

274
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,623
Because Washington DC is likely to be a terrorism

275
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Target

276
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,975
When the terror alert level goes to Orange

277
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:13,375
Then extra police are put on the mall and other parts of Washington to protect against Terror

278
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,191
Has nothing to do with Street crime or things like that

279
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
So they could then ask

280
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
Bond

281
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,335
Orange alert days when there extra police

282
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,895
On the streets for reasons unrelated

283
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Street crime

284
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
What happens if

285
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
Does it go down

286
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Halifax it does

287
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,855
It turns out that when you have the extra police there for terrorism-related reasons

288
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,975
They're all the streets they make the street safer and things like murder robbery assault go down

289
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:45,119
And that to my mind is a very clever way of establishing a causal relationship between at least in Washington DC

290
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,935
Between more police and less crime

291
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
As long as we assume that the robbers are

292
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
Hiding in the room

293
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
Because they're afraid of

294
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Elevated

295
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
Terror

296
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,943
It is entirely possible that they what are they considered was

297
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
Is it possible

298
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
The Tourist

299
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,623
We're less likely to visit Washington or to go out and about the flexbond

300
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Photography

301
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
And you know what they did

302
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Paycheck

303
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
Stat hypothesis

304
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
By looking at ridership levels

305
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
On the Metro

306
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,655
And they actually were not diminished on Haight art

307
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,983
Terre de so they suggested the number of victims was largely unchanged

308
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:27,615
So you even in this very clever Universal funding this very particular time there are ways you could trip up

309
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
I mean.

310
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Do you work Taurus

311
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Hypothesis

312
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Impossible

313
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
No there there

314
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,879
Yes it so you you know even then it's tough to establish causality but you're building a case

315
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
It's circumstantial evidence

316
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,791
In a courtroom where you're getting closer to the point where you can be persuaded

317
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,119
That yes in fact this person did that cry more

318
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
A causes b or that police reduce crime

319
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
After the break

320
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
We asked Charlie Whelan

321
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,919
Is it worth the money to send your kids to an Ivy League school

322
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967

They're not V

Teen 12 + 10

344
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,927
So pretty soon you're going to be facing

345
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
A question that a lot of pee

346
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Face which is

347
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
Which is college

348
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
Where to send your kids to college

349
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,071
And when your tongue

350
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Clever ways

351
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Tease this out

352
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
You talking book

353
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
About

354
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
Schools like Harvard and Yale

355
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
These big-name schools

356
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
Is it worthwhile to send your

357
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
Kid that will it make their life will it

358
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,943
Cause great success if you sent to those schools rather

359
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
Another one is problematic issues like cops and

360
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,415
Right and you can imagine why this is so hard to study people are not randomly assigned

361
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
To Harvard vs

362
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,279
A local community college that kids who get into Harvard

363
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Are highly Talent

364
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
Did that's why they got into Harvard so when you compare

365
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
That wages or life outcomes of people went to Harvard

366
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
Versus those who went to Webster Schools

367
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
It's that is the

368
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,663
The classic apples-to-oranges comparison there's really no legitimacy to

369
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
Did that comparison whatsoever

370
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,015
On the other hand it's a very difficult thing to study

371
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
Neither Harvard nor most families

372
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:51,231
Would agree to participate in the experiment where you at a 50% chance of being sent to Harvard to 50% chance of being sent to a commune

373
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
Any college or not being able to go to college at all

374
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
So it's hard

375
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Tease out

376
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,399
The value-added at these highly selective schools

377
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,495
But you described in your book away that some researchers managed to actually

378
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
It's not do that at least come

379
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,175
Write with a very clever experiment in this was done by two researchers Stacy Dale and Alan Krueger

380
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
They found

381
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
A large group of students

382
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,391
Who had been accepted to a group of schools that they described as the highly selective

383
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,719
It's cool so it's the ivy league and a whole bunch of others you would recognize

384
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,303
And those same students had also been selected

385
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
I admit it

386
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,191
To a group of schools that were less traditionally competitive less highly selective

387
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
So they were good enough

388
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
To get into Harvard

389
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,615
Some of them subsequently went to the highly selective schools and some of them

390
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Didn't

391
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,735
And what that sets up is a nice comparison group where everybody in the sample

392
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
Is smart enough

393
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,367
To get into what we described usually as the very best schools

394
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,903
Some went those schools

395
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
Some didn't

396
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,023
So we can then compare their life outcomes 10 or 15 years later

397
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
And

398
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,703
It turns out that there doesn't appear to be any great advantage in fact I think no statistically

399
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,007
Significant events at all in terms of wages

400
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,407
For most students going to the highly selective schools with one notable exception which is Foreman or do students

401
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
There does appear

402
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,759
To be in a bad mood for the vast majority of folks in the sample

403
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:23,647
There was no real huge advantage to getting into and going to one of these highly selective schools

404
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Well

405
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
So you have three kids

406
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,559
You are a professor of public policy you know statistics you wrote an entire book on statistics

407
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
Are you not the dad that saying queued

408
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
You don't need to go to Yale University

409
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,775
Well it given that I taught at the University of Chicago right now

410
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,871
Teacher Dartmouth I went to Princeton I would eat it

411
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,407
Yeah I know I know

412
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,455
I think that pressure cooker

413
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
High School

414
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:53,599
I'm not going to pressure them at all I think that's the takeaway is that I do think there are a lot of benefits

415
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
In terms of network effect

416
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
And things like that

417
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,207
That are

418
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
Appositive

419
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,047
Outcome related to go into those schools

420
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,423
But I'm certainly not going to put pressure on them and I'm certainly not going to cling to the delusion

421
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
That the thing that's going to shape

422
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,799
The trajectory their lives most is whether they get in or don't get in

423
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,383
Because really in this goes all the way back to the way I felt about

424
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
Chicago Public Schools

425
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,711
It's going to be the talent that they bring to the

426
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
The front door that matters most

427
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,111
So what will end up happening with your kids going to Chicago Public School

428
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
How did your mother end

429
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,791
Well there's a nice little interlude here and that we got an objective measure

430
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,655
Of how they were doing in the Chicago public schools because after they've been in school

431
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,775
For six years so my oldest started and the Chicago public schools in kindergarten

432
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
I had a sabbatical

433
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:52,735
And we move to Hanover New Hampshire Hanover New Hampshire is a privileged little Oasis that spends and ungodly amount on its paw

434
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
Public Schools

435
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:58,367
They would qualify as very good schools by any superficial measure

436
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,927
So these are the Good Foot certainly in my mother's eye

437
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
This is exactly where they should have been the first place so

438
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,767
For one year

439
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
All three kids

440
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,631
In first grade 4th grade and 6th grade

441
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,727
Transfer to the Hanover Public School so we can now see

442
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
Whether they're illiterate

443
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
It has all kinds of other problems

444
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,639
And in fact they did extraordinarily well in the universe

445
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:25,247
Schools with suggested that they were getting a very fine education in the Chicago Public Schools

446
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,063
I ended the value-added there was excellent

447
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
Did you convince your mother about the Chicago public

448
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
What's goes

449
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,255
You don't want to hurt you the first one she was always a little worried about safety that was

450
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,583
Not really an issue either but it wasn't just about the editors

451
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
I was saying her defense that she really did come around and Ona in part because of our experience and because you know was a j

452
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Genuine

453
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,823
Concerned on her part you have to grantor that

454
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,407
That when she realize the kids were turning out okay

455
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:58,015
She has actually shifted her opinion and she's a little more skeptical

456
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:03,135
Of people who pay extraordinary amounts or devote great effort

457
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
To try and get into

458
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,463
A private school when the kids

459
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,863
3 years old in the thinking that this is going to radically change that child's life so I do think and I'm not sure that she be eager to have

460
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,983
Have be sending she still didn't want my daughter going to one of the highly selective high schools in Chicago

461
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,311
But she did come around to some extent so I'll give her credit for that

462
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,199
That seems like a perfect place to wrap this up Charlie will and thank you so much for walking us through the world

463
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,831
That was good to be back with you thank you I should say that we have established that there is a high correlation

00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
Between a trailer Planet Money

And professional

466
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
Exactly

467
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
And I'm glad to be a part of that
