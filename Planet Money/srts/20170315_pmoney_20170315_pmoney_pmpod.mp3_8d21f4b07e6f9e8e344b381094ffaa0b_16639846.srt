1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,304
Hey it's Jacob Goldstein

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,168
Today Show is a rerun of a story I reported with David kestenbaum back in 2014

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,192
Puritas

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:12,288
If you'd walked up to somebody on the street a hundred years

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,312
Inesta

6
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,592
How's the economy doing

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,152
It would not have had any idea what you were talking

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:20,992
Sure people talked about how many ships came into New York Harbor or

9
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,040
How the wheat Harvest was that year but

10
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,856
This idea that we take for granted today

11
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,416
But there's this thing out there called the economy

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,232
That idea did not exist 100 years ago

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,816
And today not only do we talked about the economy

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:40,192
We talked about it with a single number so without even really thinking about what it means we can say

15
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,776
Last year for US economy grew by 1.9%

16
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,544
I was hoping for

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
2.5

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,592
At least

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,152
Today on the show how we started boiling down in

20
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
Entire nations

21
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,456
To a single number

22
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,016
Haven't number made people think they could control

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
At least you have

24
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,512
Support for this podcast and the following message come from ADP

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,072

00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,200
From hire to retire ADP had your business cover

31
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,016
ADP a more human resource

32
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,256
So Jacob we are not making this up it really does seem like V economy

33
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
At least as we know at that notion

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,864
Really was born at a particular moment in a

35
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
You can use

36
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,496
Google the go back hundreds of years and search through old books for the phrase the economy

37
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
If you do that what you find is

38
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
1700

39
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
Basically nothing

40
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,104
1800

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
Nothing 1900 nothing

42
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
And then

43
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:59,552
Two decades after 1900 people suddenly felt this really compelling need to talk about the

44
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Economy

45
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,624
This giant invisible thing that was all around

46
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,928
It was invented because of the Great Depression

47
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
This is Zachary karabell he just wrote a book called the leading indicators and he actually does that Google trick in his book

48
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,888
And it was invented because that was clearly a perception that

49
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,704
There was something really really bad going on

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
But I didn't really know what I mean

51
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,520
It's either homeless people

52
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,312
Call the street you can see that were farmers

53
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,664
You know the Okies heading from their Dust Bowl Farms off to California by the

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,736
Tens of thousands but there was no way of really grasping at

55
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,064
You can imagine say FDR same to his advisors

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,856
Will it down for me how bad is it

57
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
What's the big picture

58
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
But the answer them they needed a number

59
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,744
The number that today we call GDP

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Gross

61
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,096
It's not like no one had thought about this kind of thing but

62
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:50,752
Hundreds of years they would be moments when say the king of England would tell some advisor to go ride through the countryside

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Figure out how much

64
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,616
Stuff England had a tap all the wheat and all the horses and all the swords in

65
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,200
Figure out basically if england had enough stuff to go invade France

66
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,808
But during the Great Depression the US government decides to do this in a much more serious

67
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,880
They're going to go Way Beyond sending out a guy in a

68
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
They're going to try to add up

69
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
Everything that gets made in the end

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
Tire country in a given year

71
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,096
All the houses that get built all the beers sold in bars every

72
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,168
Fedora every Studebaker every visit to the doctor

73
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,728
And to do this they need a numbers guy

74
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128
A guy who is willing to devote his life to waiting through really boring reports and figuring out how to add up last

75
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
Lots of numbers

76
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,456
And they find just the right guy

77
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
His name is Simon

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,064
We called up Economist glenwild who is written about him

79
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
And yes

80
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
What was Christmas like

81
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
Extremely extremely serious

82
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Sundry

83
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
Not surprisingly

84
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
I suppose

85
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,096
But but not just like Economist or serious and dry like

86
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,912
He was extremely extremely sober

87
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,216
Totally data-driven

88
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
Just

89
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
The ultimate

90
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Careful

91
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
Sober scholar

92
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
For even less fun than your average

93
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,016
Adding up all this stuff is harder than it may sound

94
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
First of all

95
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
App to figure out everything that you need to count

96
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,416
Just trying to find what things need to be included

97
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,047
Is an incredibly complicated task time in the steel industry Association

98
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,607
Had figures on how many tons of steel were being

99
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,423
Agricultural Association

100
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
You have many tons of

101
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Grainware B

102
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,335
But no one had made an attempt to actually put that all together into an integrated

103
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
Picture of all the economic Act

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
Activity that was going on

105
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,015
Imagine at some point they added it up and they're like oh wait we forgot ice cream parlors

106
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
Yes

107
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
Once you figured out what the count

108
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
You have to figure out how to count it

109
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,415
For one thing

110
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,231
You have to make sure you're only counting what the US is produce

111
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
So if someone buys up Hershey bar in New York City

112
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,143
But the cocoa to make that chocolate bar came from Brazil

113
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,983
You have to subtract out the cost of the Coco because it didn't come from them

114
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
The Coco is part of Brazil

115
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,615
The Christmas and a bunch of other numbers guys go to work

116
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,919
And in 1934

117
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,479
At the request of Congress they publish this report

118
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
Actually makes me yawn

119
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
The title

120
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
It is called

121
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,135
National income 1929 to 1932

122
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
And this report this report becomes

123
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,279
A bestseller thousands of copies of printed

124
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
And they sell out

125
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,631
Here's a sampling of what Americans were so eager to read

126
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Quote

127
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,311
The economic changes that occurred in this country during recent years are sufficiently striking to be a parent to any Observer with

128
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Without the assistance of

129
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Statistical measure

130
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
There is considerable value however

131
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,223
In checking the unarmed observation

132
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
Given a careful student by the lights

133
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Have a quantitative picture of

134
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
Wealth of David

135
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,463
You can see why this very wonky City

136
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,279
Which at the time was called national income

137
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
Becomes part of an overnight sensation

138
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:01,215
More than anything before its national income is an answer to this really basic question

139
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,519
What the hell is going on

140
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,847
How bad are things are they getting worse are they getting better

141
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,919
I presume you can't turn on the radio without

142
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:14,271
Cheering these new numbers and what they're measuring this new thing called the economy

143
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
Here's Zachary karabell

144
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
By 1937 Roosevelt starts

145
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
Talking about

146
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
The economy and he starts talking about

147
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
National income going up

148
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
National income

149
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,839
Had a mounted in the year nineteen

150
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,863
29

151
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
281

152
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Billion dollars

153
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,335
You never hear Abraham Lincoln or Teddy Roosevelt or George Washington

154
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Talking in

155
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:43,967
That's why one of the things that's remarkable to me is how quickly went from a world where none of these

156
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,015
Terms and none of this conversation

157
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Part of

158
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,575
Our national consciousness

159
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
To a dance at the center of our naps

160
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
This number that

161
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Kuznets is adding

162
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
Becomes part of a kind of

163
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023
Intellectual Revolution

164
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,607
Over in England the Brits are also adding up this number

165
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:05,983
And the British economist John Maynard Keynes starts talkin about the economy is something that the government

166
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Control

167
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
Because you can name something you can boil the economy down to a single number single member that rises or Falls

168
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Falls every year

169
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Starstruck rated peep

170
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
Maybe we can change it

171
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
Maybe we can control

172
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
You got a lot of people who really start believing

173
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
That there's this thing called the economy

174
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,951
That's a that's a mechanical system

175
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
Database laws just like physics

176
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
And that if you can get the

177
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,631
If you can describe the system of the variables correctly

178
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
It's very mechanistic

179
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
Input and output out and

180
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
The part of the reason for measuring is the

181
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
The belief that

182
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
All this fuzziness that had attended human has

183
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
3 round

184
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Waves of

185
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,991
But you verse of growth and then collapse and money going off in money going down

186
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
That we could capture and

187
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
Control it the same way scientist

188
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
We're capturing

189
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
Controlling physical real

190
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,719
This new idea of this idea that Economist and the government could really cook

191
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
Troll this new thing called The Academy

192
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,815
What's about to be tested in a

193
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Hugosway

194
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,167
In 1941 the US enters World War

195
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,007
And the government basically takes over the US economy to fight the

196
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
The fighting an all-out war is not just risky for soldiers

197
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
It can be nasty food shortages at

198
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
Homemade Cannon rampant inflation

199
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,735
Can bankrupt a country almost overnight

200
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
If you're going to

201
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,087
Turn all of this domestic industry into war

202
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Car plants

203
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
The tank plants

204
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
Parts plans into gun plans

205
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:32,767
Cino clothing factories into military apparel

206
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
How much

207
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
How far can you go in the direction of

208
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,143
War output before you imperil domestic

209
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
Production

210
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,263
And how far could you go before people started freaking out and worrying

211
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
That prices would rise and goods

212
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
Fortunately the US has a secret weapon

213
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
The most boring Economist on the planet

214
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Simon

215
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,087
Christmas becomes the chief Economist on the planning committee of the war production

216
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
But fer is apparently not consulted with Guzman

217
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
And in 1942

218
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
He gives his State of the Union

219
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Beach laying out

220
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,327
Incredibly specific plans for what he wants to do inter

221
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Terms of war production

222
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,167
He says this year we're going to make 60000 plane

223
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,007
And 45000 tanks and it goes on and on with specific numbers for

224
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Ships

225
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
An anti-aircraft

226
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,479
Looks at those numbers he really crunches them he uses those tools that he put together to make his early version of GDP

227
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
Videos back to the Roosevelt

228
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
And he says I've got some bad news

229
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Your big plan

230
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
It isn't going to work

231
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,303
Christmas looks at how much steel and aluminum and copper the US is producing he looks at how many factories there are

232
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,447
And he realizes US economy just is not big enough to make all the planes and tanks and everything else that Roosevelt

233
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
And if us tries to do that

234
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,615
It could lead to shortages it could lead to massive inflation it could wreck the US economy

235
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,919
It was the generals versus The Economist

236
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
And The Economist one

237
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Betsy Roosevelt listen

238
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,087
There are many people who have said and I would agree with him that the invention of GDP

239
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
Was

240
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
One of the prime factors in winning the war

241
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
The ability to

242
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
With some confidence

243
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
Be able to dedicate all these resources

244
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,143
Is 11 reasons why America won the war wasn't because we

245
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Fought for

246
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
Chick-fil-A better than anyone else is

247
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,263
Because we had such a massive industrial machine

248
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,311
The dwarf the capacity of anybody else

249
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,663
And it was because we're able to use that with confidence that we weren't going to create huge

250
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Domestic

251
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Destruction

252
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
The Warren

253
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,623
And after the GDP really Suites the world there are these new international organizations that United

254
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,927
Nations international monetary fund the World Bank

255
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,487
And the people running these new Global Group

256
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
They love GDP

257
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,607
First thing you do in the 1950s and 60s if your new nation is

258
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
You open a national airline

259
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
You create a national Army and you start measuring

260
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:55,103
And you start measuring GDP because if you want to go to the World Bank where you want to go to the UN and you want some sort of economic aid

261
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
The sole criteria for those is

262
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
If we give you money

263
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
You have to show that it helped your GDP

264
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,575
And of course once you have a single number summing up your country's economy

265
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
It's tempting to rank country

266
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
By GDP

267
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
Like it's some kind of Olympic competition

268
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,583
Which people do especially during the Cold War which of the Cold War as much as anything with this battle of economic system

269
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Who's winning

270
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
Communism or capitalism

271
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
What is GDP

272
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,543
Politicians around the world start to focus on this thing how do we make our GDP bigger

273
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,079
How do we win this competition

274
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
How do we move up in the rankings

275
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
By the 19th

276
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,735
60 GDP of such a big deal that it gets its own back

277
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,063
Robert Kennedy calls out its shortcomings in 1968

278
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,647
Get the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children

279
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
The quality of their education

280
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
Funny jokes

281
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,351
It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages

282
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,703
Kennedy was the only one complaining about how GDP was being used

283
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:57,055
Simon kuznets the super serious sober Economist who would help

284
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Created

285
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
He eventually won the Nobel Prize in part for that

286
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
But he was not entirely happy

287
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
With how is key

288
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Creation was being used

289
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
Again Zachary Carroll

290
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,599
Just like Robert Oppenheimer who helped create the nuclear bomb

291
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,671
Later camera coiled at the proliferation

292
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,999
Have nuclear weapons and strengthening defined by that

293
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
Cuz that's themselves

294
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
Sylectus the fetishization of numbers

295
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,399
And the use of this number as a proxy

296
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
C for everything

297
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,239
Is what politicians do it's what people do

298
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,335
I would never have recommended that I wouldn't and it's the easy way out

299
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
Avoiding hard discussion

300
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
Data can be easily abused

301
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,807
In just a few decades GDP went from being a useful depression-era tool to a World War 2 weapons

302
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:45,439
2 piece of Cold War propaganda to basing its own backlash in the 1960s

303
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,463
And of course

304
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511
GDP is still with us today

305
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,327
Soap in the end what should we make of

306
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
What does GDP really do

307
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
It does what it says on the tin it measures the economy

308
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
We should try to make it do something it's not intent

309
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,639
Diane Coyle is an economist who just wrote a book called GDP a brief but affectionate history

310
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
And she says look

311
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:11,551
GDP was never intended to measure overall well-being or a nation's standard of living

312
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,879
Certain things that are bad actually make GDP go up

313
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
Hurricane damage that cost a lot to fix

314
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
Sometimes it's not even clear what should count

315
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,863
For example suppose Jacob you and I both stay home to take care of our kids

316
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,703
That labor by the current rules does not count as GDP

317
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:35,359
Even though it's pretty clearly work but Jacob if you come take care of my kids and I go take care of your kids and we pay each other

318
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
And it does

319
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:42,015
And then there's the black market which means everything from off-the-books babysitters to Mafia drug

320
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
In the US

321
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,391
The black market does not count towards GDP but in some other countries it does

322
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,463
Back in the 80s Italy started counting it's black

323
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,815
And overnight the Italian economy became bigger than the UK economy

324
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
Italian celebrate

325
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
They called it you'll Sorpasso

326
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
Nothing is really

327
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Change

328
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
Here's Diane Coyle

329
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
We

330
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
10 things about GDP is if it's a natural object

331
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:12,991
It's like a mountain and we have methods of measuring it that are better or worse than more or less accurate

332
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
But there is a thing that be measured

333
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,367
Actually that's just not true with the economy

334
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
There's no

335
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
Natural entity code GDP

336
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
In the universe

337
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
In other words

338
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,095
Maybe the most important thing to remember about GDP is

339
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
It's not a thing

340
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,935
It's an idea and that idea keeps changing

341
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,799
Just last year the US tweet the way it calculates GDP and in an instant

342
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
The economy was 500 billion dollars

343
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,479
Hate this jacob back in 2017

344
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,807
There is one last thing about Simon kuznets

345
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
The man who invented GDP

346
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,671
You may be more famous today for something else invented

347
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
Call the kuznetsov

348
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Curt

349
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,279
Was his explanation for income inequality

350
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
More than that in just

351
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,679

Christmas in equality and the Christmas

357
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
Simon kuznets came up with the curve in the 19th

358
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
This was a moment when

359
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Income inequality with

360
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Falling in the US

361
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
And in other developed

362
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
He looked at the data

363
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
Thought about the world they said okay

364
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,935
Are basically three phases to historical inequality

365
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Phase one

366
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
Pre-industrial societies

367
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
There's almost no inequality

368
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
Because almost everybody is bore

369
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
Phase 2

370
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:48,479
One comes industrialization some people get really rich most a poor

371
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
Inequalities shoots up

372
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
And then phase 3

373
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,135
This is what was happening in the fifties people move to the cities

374
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
Education improve the middle class emerges

375
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
Inequality Falls

376
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,583
The story fit the date of the time it seemed so true the idea became widely accepted

377
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,935
People named this curve of rising and then falling it equality after presidents

378
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
Equipnet curve

379
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,591
But of course a few decades later in the US and in other developed countries in equality started Rising again

380
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
And the kuznets Curve

381
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
Kind of went out the way

382
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:21,759
Recently that one Economist said maybe we should think about the world in terms of quiz netsuite

383
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,575
Over the very long run inequality Rises

384
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Falls

385
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Sunrises

386
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Then Falls and baby
