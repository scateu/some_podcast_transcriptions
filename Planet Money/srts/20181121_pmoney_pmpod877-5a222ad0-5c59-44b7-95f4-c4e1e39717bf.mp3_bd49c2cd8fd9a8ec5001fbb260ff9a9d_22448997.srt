1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:02,048
Did you look up today

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,608
I'd like the thing I like the thing

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:07,680
The statute of limitations in Pennsylvania

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,984
Misdemeanors is

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,008
2 years

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,544
2 years

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,384
Yeah so can you tell us the story but let us not do it here

8
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,992
Let us do it here alone has brought us to a drug store that has a

9
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,296
Self checkout I used to be

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,088
A cashier at a grocery store

11
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:31,488
When I was about 16 years old you have no idea dude I look like I was 11 years old a day

12
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
I can do that I can

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,840
So one day I learned that my managers

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
I started to keep track of the performance of all of the cashier's how friendly you are

15
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,032
They were measuring our like

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,080
Items scanned per minute

17
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,616
They're posting those

18
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,920
For the other cashiers to see

19
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,712
I'm a little competitive

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,344
Got it that's got to get my boss numbers and then

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,416
I get this item that won't scan

22
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
Rolando never stands at the grocery store cilantro in rural Pennsylvania

23
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:11,680
Food was weirdly hard to scan the label. All torn up and crap anyway I'm trying to scan this thing and

24
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,776
All I can think is like oh my God my items per minute is plummeting plummeting

25
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,824
And then finally I just

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,616
Let it go down the register

27
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
Unscanned

28
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
And I grab the next item and the cat food away for free

29
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
Cuz we would have say I stole the cat food but to be a good employee

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:38,048
I was just trying to be good employee I was trying to get good numbers and I got good numbers my

31
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,912
Items permitted where I believe the best in the entire grocery store was out

32
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
Okay but when your boss has said

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,520
Speed things up I'm sure that they didn't mean

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
Break the law in the process

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Yes

36
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
Yes and that

37
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Is the point of this story

38
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
I

39
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Maven breaking

40
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,224
The normal law

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,504
But I have since learned

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
That I was simply following a different law

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
Known as good heart

44
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
Lock good heart

45
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
Lockhart slaw

46
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
It essentially States

47
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,256
But if a company decides to measure something

48
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,352
The employees are going to find a way to give you good numbers

49
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
You just may not like

50
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
How they do it

51
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:22,848
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Sarah Gonzalez

52
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,456
Dozens of these laws or rules or principles

53
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
Goodhart's law also

54
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,808
The Peter Principle and Parkinson's law

55
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
Today on the show we take a look at

56
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,464
These laws that clean to explain just about everything that can go wrong in an office

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
From Bad managers

58
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
Too terrible

59
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Procrastinate

60
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,352
It may change everything

61
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
About the way you were

62
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
Or it may just prove it

63
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,008
People spend more time reading about productivity then

64
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
Actually being productive

65
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736

Hi is this professor guitar

76
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
Yep speaking and

77
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
You are

78
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
Professor goodhart

79
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Of goodhart's law

80
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:31,968
I am in

81
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
Do you proudly wear that moniker

82
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,624
I get mixed feelings

83
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,672
This is Charles goodhart

84
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Economist

85
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
Former advisor to England

86
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Central Bank

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Professor emeritus at Linens

88
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,424
School of economics and about 45 years ago Charles goodhart wrote a paper about monetary policy

89
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
That included in the introduction

90
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
A faithful little line

91
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
Ignoring a good hot slow

92
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,384
Did any observed

93
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Statistical regularity

94
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,456
Will technical apps

95
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,504
Once pressure is placed upon

96
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
The control pill

97
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
Okay hard to understand but

98
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648
He was making a very narrow point

99
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,976
About how measuring one tiny slice of the economy

100
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
Seems to mess up

101
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
That slice of vehicle

102
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
Put hot slow with ex

103
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
Play

104
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Bother

105
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Joking

106
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
Sidecar

107
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,007
It was not intended at that

108
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
To be taken

109
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
Bacteria

110
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
But over time it was

111
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,711
People took goodhart's law out of the world of monetary policy and

112
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
Came up with new formula

113
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
End of the law for example

114
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,367
Once you target a measure it ceases to be a good measure

115
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
I think it's one of them

116
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,743
The point is really fed the simple let's say that

117
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,279
One of the measures

118
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
All of egg hunts

119
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,375
Is that the waking time

120
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
Is captured

121
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:59,263
This is a real example the British government started pressuring its hospitals to

122
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
C emergency

123
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Patience fast

124
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,103
Start with in 4 hours

125
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
And sure enough

126
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Wait times

127
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Truck

128
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
Just not always for the right

129
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Reasons

130
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,295
Hospital started

131
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
Gaming the statistics

132
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
And one of the most outrageous exam

133
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
This practice wear

134
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,487
Patients would be asked to wait inside an ambulance

135
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
Until the hospital

136
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
With absolutely sure

137
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
That patient could be seen within the four hour time

138
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
Then the patient

139
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
Another way of stating goodhart's law

140
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
Be careful what you measure

141
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Because

142
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,591
Your employees are going to make it happen

143
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
Indeed

144
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,967
And they will do it by reallocating resources to achieve that

145
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
One measure

146
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
And fails

147
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Tumi

148
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,575
Non talkative

149
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Measures

150
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
Because resources will it be 9 located away free

151
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,743
When you first introduced goodhart's law Universe specific app

152
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
That's correct

153
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
Not exactly the same

154
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,887
How do you how do you feel about these broader formulation

155
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,751
Well I know I'm perfectly happy with the mine when I woke up this

156
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,311
Kids cooking

157
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
Didn't some reason

158
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
750s appointed

159
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
King that I'm probably busy

160
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,479
Name for Walker Hayes had a chocolate comment

161
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Off to some

162
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Theism

163
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Doing more reps

164
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Considered academic

165
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
Detailed work

166
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
For which I am listening

167
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
And so Sarah I feel like

168
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
We should introduce a

169
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
The corollary to

170
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
If you decide to name Allah

171
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
It will become a law

172
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
And you may not like what it does

173
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
To your legacy

174
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
Hello check onto Carnival in here

175
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
Walking up to the task of Sarah Gonzales

176
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,807
Hey okay so it's like what 9:30 in the morning

177
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
Thursday November 8th

178
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
And we're supposed to be

179
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
Working on the next segment of this episode

180
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,583
We're not even close to finished supposed to tell you about the so-called Parkinson's law

181
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
Which states essentially that

182
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Work expands

183
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
To the time allotted

184
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Silver example

185
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,775
Penny and I have an entire week

186
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,335
To finish this Parkinson's law segment

187
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,431
If we're being honest that should really only take like one day's work

188
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
Probably yeah

189
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015
But we have a whole week

190
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,343
So that means we're probably going to spend time like looking for

191
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
Archival tape that work

192
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,231
Probably not going to use we are going to do extra interviews that if we're being honest

193
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,327
Not room for in this piece always do that we have a week

194
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,631
Into the work will expand to fill the week

195
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,191
But today we're going to try to use Parkinson's law

196
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Talkative

197
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,263
And reporter for this segment though

198
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
She does not know it yet

199
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Is Planet Money newest producer

200
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
Alexi Horowitz Ghazi

201
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
And we are waiting for him to

202
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Alexi

203
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Hey man

204
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
So let me just get into work yes

205
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
Circumference do with me

206
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
Coming coming

207
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
So

208
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
We have a

209
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Professor

210
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,679
On the line right now who's an expert in Parkinson's law

211
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,215
Hello professor

212
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Hi

213
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
And I told you that I was going to do the interview

214
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
We want you to dinner

215
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
What

216
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,895
And furthermore we want you to do the whole segment

217
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
There's one catch

218
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
The time allotted for you to finish

219
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
This work

220
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Is one day

221
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
You have to finish this by the end of the

222
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,135
All right let's do it she's literally rolling up his sleeves

223
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,719
That's right that's good

224
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,767
Professor can you hear me

225
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Great

226
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
I'm okay so maybe

227
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Start out with

228
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
Well we are back in the studio

229
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
You had a day

230
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
Your sleeves are still rolled up actually

231
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
You interviewed the professor do you have a story

232
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,127
The key to my success and yes I do

233
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
All right let's do it

234
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,967
So the first thing she told me was that

235
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
Parkinson's law started out

236
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
As

237
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
A joke yes

238
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
So it all started

239
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
With a humorous essay published

240
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Economist

241
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
And

242
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,511
1955

243
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,071
The author was C

244
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
Northcote Parkinson

245
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
Was a British Naval historian

246
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
That's mangs you of the Johns Hopkins Business School

247
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,871
In 1955 The Economist published Parkinson's essay is a kind of

248
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
Facetious argument

249
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,711
And he talked about why bureaucracies

250
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,527
Almost always grow no matter how much work

251
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
They're really doing

252
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,903
Actually found some archival tape of the now-deceased professor Parkinson

253
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,767
Talking about the essay you actually write Hazard KY

254
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
I'm serious in

255
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,935
Elite nice have been sent to a humorous magazine

256
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
Instead and

257
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
I think more why is it

258
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
I sent it to the London economist

259
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Townhouse

260
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
You found someone that is more British

261
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
Then professor Charles goodhart

262
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
This is very impressive

263
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,271
That actually came off a 1960 vinyl album

264
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,831
Called Professor C Northcote Parkinson

265
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
Explain Parkinson's law

266
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,183
The blurb on the cover closet quote

267
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,975
Delightfully unprocess Oreo

268
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,559
I should be Planet Money slogan I feel like that's what we're going for

269
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,399
Makes as a Parkinson's article was mostly about why bureaucracy

270
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Escrow

271
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,775
But the thing that really stuck with people that really made it a big deal was the opening line

272
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,103
He summarized the law in the first sentence of his essay

273
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
It basically says what

274
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,247
Expands so as to fill the time available

275
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
Voice competition

276
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,367
Make says that even though it started as a joke by the 1960s

277
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,183
People were actually treating this like a real

278
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
La

279
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
Add psychologist and economist

280
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Coming up with

281
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
Experiments in a laboratory to try and figure out if

282
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
People would expand their work

283
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
To Fit changing deadlines

284
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
It seems like they actually did

285
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,799
And then the other people going out and trying to find Parkinson's law in the wild

286
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
Field

287
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Cast

288
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,383
Across a variety of contexts

289
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
Such as

290
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
Wood Harvesters

291
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
The only industry

292
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:06,879
School system and her colleagues have actually studied this and sure enough they found that when they gave their

293
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,695
Subjects longer deadlines they expanded the work

294
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
To fit those deadlines

295
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
And she says that

296
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
By now

297
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
Parkinson's law has become a storied part

298
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
Cubicle lure

299
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
It has been a men's topic

300
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
4

301
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,103
Management training how how do you fight Parkinson's law

302
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
First you could

303
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,175
Shorten your deadlines

304
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:35,295
Know something about that. You could offer a reward for fast

305
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,367
Task completion are you asking us for a reward right now

306
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
This is a hold

307
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Like a stick-up

308
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,559
How much money do we have in our pocket Pockets turn them out

309
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,143
Wallet with all the money my wallet so I got ahold taller

310
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,215
Thanks good work man made it rain

311
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
This is backed up by science

312
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,847
May says that you know even though Parkinson's law started

313
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
As a joke

314
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,431
It's been documented through a lot of different studies

315
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
But more importantly she says

316
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
It just makes intuitive sense

317
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
Yeah that's the thing I think

318
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,903
People intuitively agree with his logic arguments

319
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Man

320
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Mets

321
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,071
I think I think we just got cut off I think that means that

322
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
Our interview expanded to the time

323
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Weed allotted for

324
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,775
Cutout

325
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:33,663
Alexi you did it you finish the task at hand in one day

326
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Instead of a week

327
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
It was exactly

328
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
As good as if we had done it in a while

329
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,367
Better thank you Alexi thanks Connie thank Sarah and Alexa

330
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,415
We are going to properly reward

331
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
You for this I'm going to go buy you a pint

332
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
Have the most English Beer Week

333
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
We can possibly find

334
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Excitement

335
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Cheers

336
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,959
Okay the next light is called the

337
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,519
Peter Principle this one says that in a hierarchy

338
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
Every employee tents

339
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
2

340
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
Rise to their level of incompetence

341
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
If you're good at your job your boss

342
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Notice is promote

343
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
See you then

344
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
Forget that job

345
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,807
Can you keep getting promoted

346
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,623
Until you get promoted to a job that

347
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
You are not

348
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Good act

349
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Find out what that feels like

350
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
We asked our boss

351
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Remember this

352
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,631
Annual reviews just a few weeks

353
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,703
Jacktv we all think Alex is really good at his job

354
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
Alex react

355
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
How do you define someone who

356
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Had the self-awareness

357
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,127
To realize that they were falling victim to the Peter Pan

358
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,175
Yes and I found

359
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Stephanie Brown

360
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
This story starts

361
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
Almost two years ago

362
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,159
I was doing a job that I love and never felt like I was

363
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
Even working I loved it so much

364
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
Stephanie was a social media specialist for a large universe

365
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
Behind the scenes job what she likes

366
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,655
Find good stories about people around campus

367
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
And then figure out how to

368
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
Share them on social media

369
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
Creativity

370
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,543
She had a lot of freedom she got to

371
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Independently

372
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
And these were the things she was looking for

373
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
It just felt it was somewhere around

374
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
It's really comfortable

375
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
It really

376
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,063
But that front of a lot of strengths that I have

377
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
Phase one of the Peter Prince

378
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
She is doing great

379
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,183
She knows that she's good at some things

380
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
And not others

381
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
And then I was asked

382
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,791
Have the interested in this figure all

383
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,607
Great promotion totally normal this is how jobs

384
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
Now she's in charge of webcon

385
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
University

386
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Spend a lot of time in meeting

387
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
And harbor job

388
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
To tell other people how to do

389
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Their jobs

390
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
So this is not behind this

391
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,943
I'm an introvert so having to

392
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
Like stand up and a group of people

393
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
Super uncomfortable for me

394
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
From the start I had to do monthly training

395
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,719
Let's just hope sex before that every time and she becomes a person

396
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
Who everyone brings their problems to asking her to find us a

397
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
Number one time

398
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Haven't smoked

399
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,911
Let me in the cafeteria

400
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
Something they didn't like

401
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
Put on the spot

402
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,103
Holding my lunch and standing there not sure what

403
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
To do how to handle it

404
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,711
I am terrible at this time

405
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,735
There are

406
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
Millions of Stephanie

407
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Everywhere

408
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
In every

409
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:25,951
Great just because you're a good teacher doesn't mean you're going to be a good principal and just because you're a good lawyer.

410
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:31,071
Does it mean you're going to be good at bringing in new clients to the law firm this is the Peter Prince

411
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,423
It comes from a best-selling book back in the early 70s by a professor Lawrence

412
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
J Peter

413
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
And it was actually Sarah

414
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Kind of a joke

415
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
Course all of our logic jokes

416
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,895
This one was satire add the point the doctor Peter was trying to make was

417
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
Look around

418
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,479
This is the explanation for why

419
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,319
So many people are bad at their jobs like so many mistakes

420
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
Just happened over and over again

421
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
And why so many people

422
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Hate their job

423
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
Like Stephanie Burton

424
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
And Stephanie

425
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
Is rare in the cheat

426
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
Is self-aware enough to know it and admit it

427
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,119
And also to do something about it

428
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,679
Stephanie is fighting the Peter Principle

429
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,983
My stepping down from her new bigger job

430
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
Today is actually my very last

431
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
Stay in a quit

432
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
She's going to the motor

433
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
She wouldn't talk to her boss and she said

434
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,295
Hey I want a job like my old one the one that I love the one that I was good at

435
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Yeah you know it I don't know that a lot of

436
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,415
People admit that they should be demoted

437
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
But I think

438
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
For me it makes me happier

439
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,327
That makes me feel like I can do a better job

440
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
And I feel smarter at what I do

441
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Because

442
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,447
I know

443
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
My job so well now

444
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
Self demotion that is one way to beat the Peter Principle

445
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
Get any ideas

446
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,247
I think there are some important meetings you have to go to I think it's

447
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:59,647
Payroll day today alright I'm going to go find Kenny tell him to come on back in here thanks letter

448
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183

462
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
We figured we need something

463
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
The did not just start out as a joke

464
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
About crappy management

465
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
Or lousy procrastination

Our final log comes from Alice

467
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
And I have a long boring title

468
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,215
I'm Electra at King's College London

469

Got it

472
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
What you really need to know about Alice's

473
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
She is the kind of Professor

474
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,711
Who when a Brand New World Bank report

475
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Comes out

476
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,319
She live tweets her reactions as if she is watching game of

477
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
Throat

478
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
Vitalis told us about it

479
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
Is pretty well-documented

480
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
But as far as we know it

481
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
Doesn't have a name

482
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
But here's how Alex

483
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Social change

484
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,351
Satellites when we see that others are

485
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Another word

486
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
People want to change

487
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,239
They just want to see other people do it

488
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
Process of a snowboard

489
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
But the tricky thing is how do you get

490
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
Snowbowl to move in the first place

491
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,175
So let me give you for example

492
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
For example

493
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,015
This is great

494
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
Brilliant intervention in

495
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,159
Uganda this was an intervention by Innovations for poverty

496
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,927
Action

497
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,231
Uganda was struggling with dementia

498
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:44,095
Violent it was happening at alarming rates and people didn't seem to be reporting abuse

499
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
Something needed to change

500
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
But

501
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,935
For this law with no name

502
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,239
You shouldn't just tell people to do some

503
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,311
You should show them that other people are doing it

504
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,127
And so i p a r and a video camp

505
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Doing

506
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
Essentially

507
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,967
Did the video did not tell

508
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,015
The gender-based violence is wrong

509
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
Old shows

510
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,647
People going out and being supported by that community

511
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,719
And what they found within 6 months

512
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,839
Is this led to a rapid increase in repulsing a big production in gender-based violence

513
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,655
There are a bunch of examples of changing social norms

514
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
For example

515
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,215
College vintage

516
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,615
Instead of putting a poster that said binge drinking is bad research has put up signs that the centrally said

517
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
Hey actual statistics show that your classmates

518
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,223
Don't drink as much as you

519
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
You think they drink

520
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,271
And

521
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,807
That approach seem to work

522
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
So this approach

523
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
It occurred to me

524
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,159
I think I have a problem

525
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
The disk could help fix

526
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
Still Alice I know that

527
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
Typically your job

528
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Deals with

529
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,303
Very important

530
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,095
Global political high stakes

531
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Issues

532
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
But would you mind talking to me about

533
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
The fact that no one at my office watch

534
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
Cheese dishes

535
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Shoot

536
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
It's okay

537
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,823
People in our office are leaving dirty dishes

538
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
In the sink all the

539
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
And so my idea was like

540
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
What if

541
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
We work with the office manager

542
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
To put up poster

543
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,783
Didn't say

544
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Hey you should

545
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Do dishes

546
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,111
What If instead they said

547
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
Hey did you know everybody else does

548
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,999
The dishes a bunch and Alice was like no this approach only works

549
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
If you are actually

550
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
Telling

551
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,887
The truth so I wouldn't run a fake campaign I think that's really dangerous

552
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,191
Because if people realize that the office manager

553
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,751
Putting up fake posters then that could

554
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
Undermine Trust

555
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
In the office

556
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
So I would I wouldn't do that Kenny

557
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,479
Drew parallels with

558
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,295
So for example

559
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:45,695
Alice says that in remote parts of Zambia healthcare workers often feel like no one cares what they're doing

560
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,511
This curbs worker morale makes it hard for them to

561
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
Show up and

562
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
Do their best work

563
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
But

564
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,119
One thing that really helped

565
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,191
Was when supervisors started awarding a trophy

566
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:02,079
For people's work there wasn't even money attached it was just a trophy just that sense of being appreciated

567
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,151

Episode

582
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,600
So I have a weird request

583
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
I'm trying to make

584
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
A trophy

585
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
With a golden bug on top

586
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,232

587
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
Shana Planet Money In

Rooms To Go

589
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,864
And custom-order a congratulations the kitchen is clean

590
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
Trophy all I needs to say is

591
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,216
The dishes are all done

592
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,800
Shane bought a five foot tall trophy

593
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,128
And then let's do an! On the end Eddie real

594
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Bug spray paint

595
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
Did gold on the very top

596
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,016
And when the dishes were clean this giant trophy would show up

597
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
They weren't

598
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
The chubby disappeared

599
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
We left a recorder out

600
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,672
Let people figure it out

601
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
It's really here

602
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,840
So there's this giant ass trophy

603
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,960
Fork and knife taped to it so I imagine it's an award for eating of some kind

604
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:39,360
Psychological experiment is being conducted without my consent

605
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,920
Office problems

606
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,944
There's no trophy

607
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,272
There's a dirty spoon in the sink not mine but I will wash it

608
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
Should we get the trophy back

609
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,392
The dishes are all done because of because I see the trophy

610
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
I feel like

611
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
I've been tricked by a trophy

612
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:59,840
Does a trophy would make me want to do that has disappeared again

613
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:06,240
There's some dishes in the sink supervising producer Alex goldmark is doing them

614
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,592
This was quite unsigned

615
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
But I'm just going to say it

616
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,920
I think there were way fewer

617
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Unwashed dishes

618
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
