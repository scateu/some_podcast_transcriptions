1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,096
Venezuela used to be the richest country in Latin America

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,376
Oil money

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,168
Lots of oil money

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,520
Venezuelans like Mila remember the capital city bustling with biz

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,872
Can I go see used to be

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,944
MTD full of cars and people and

7
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,504
Acadias but good game

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
But when oil prices

9
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,392
Does tanks a couple years ago

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416
Bad chaos

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
Venezuela ran out of money

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,512
Foot started printing more money

13
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
To pay its bills

14
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,632
And printing all this money made the value of the money

15
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Plummet

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,192
Venezuela's currency is called

17
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,216
The boulevard

18
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
Or them

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,008
Bolivar

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,824
Okay

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,664
So everyday now you need more and more

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
Believer has to buy the simplest things like

23
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
Chocolate

24
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320
If you want a good chocolate like a

25
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,880
I don't know me to keep away or something like that

26
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
You can lathe

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,928
In Minnesota

28
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,976
But you did a black bag of

29
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
Bills

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,768
You need

31
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,072
Millions of body virus

32
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
Some Economist call this the wheelbarrow problem where you literally have to haul your money around in garbage bags

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
Suitcases or

34
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
Wheelbarrows

35
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,568
Dubai the tiniest thing

36
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,848
The term comes from Germany

37
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,152
In the 1920s Germany's money was

38
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,432
Is losing value like

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,808
So when you go to the store with your backpack filled with money

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,344
How does the person at the

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
The store count all of this money

42
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,952
They have to know their way

43
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,488
Of that bills

44
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,280
I need to weigh the bills

45
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
Yes

46
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
The smaller bills

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
They're not even worth the

48
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,400
The paper they're printed on anymore

49
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,216
They lined the streets and nobody bothers to pick them up

50
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,264
People are shredding up money to use as

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
Confetti

52
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Belts

53
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Bracelet out of money

54
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
Leaving money baskets

55
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
If you have

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,432
12 bolivares today

57
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
It's worth

58
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,784
6 in a couple weeks then 3 then basically

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Nothing

60
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:04,928
Think of Venezuela's money as an unwrapped chocolate by the minute it touches your hand

61
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
It's melting

62
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Disappearing

63
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,048
So Venezuelans are trying to get rid of their money

64
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Right away

65
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
Trade it in for

66
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
Anything at all

67
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,704
Toilet paper chicken okay I have

68
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
Sugar

69
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
To it

70
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
Sugar

71
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,360
Holds its value better than the melting Boulevard

72
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:30,016
Stimulus as you spend your whole paycheck on sacks of sugar and those sacks of sugar are now you're saving

73
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
Account those are the things you can

74
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Hopefully cellular

75
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,208
Trade later to pay your rent or a cab fare maybe you can say that

76
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,048
Cheer are for me or some coffee

77
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
4

78
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,864
Toilet paper.

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
That's unique

80
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
And then Mila gets

81
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
A call

82
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,288
From this young guy in Mexico City and he's like

83
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,384
Venezuelans don't have to invest their money in bags of sugar that's

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Crazy

85
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,992
I'm running this whole online operation that can connect

86
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
Venezuelan

87
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
To us

88
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Dollars

89
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
Illustrates working with him

90
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:11,488
And helping Venezuelan store their money in US dollars

91
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,840
Turns out to be a really dangerous thing to do

92
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:21,216
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Sarah Gonzales and I Melissa S car say

93
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,056
Three on the show Venezuelan government has arrested hundreds of people

For trading currency

95
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:30,688
We try to find out why we talked to some people to narrowly escaped

96
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Mila

97
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,064
Mina's on the Run

People trade their currency for dollars all over the world

108
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,208
But a lot of countries make this hard to do

109
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,047
So this guy in Mexico made a website to help people get around these

110
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
His name is Reuben

111
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Do when you're pretty young right

112
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
Yeah I'm pretty young

113
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
I guess

114
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
How do you

115
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,055
I 13 + 27

116
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
827

117
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,151
Man calls himself a Libertarian and a

118
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,991
Freedom Fighter russinko face of the freedom fighter because

119
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,087
We think that the biggest issue is money is that

120
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Strap

121
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,415
So everything we do all day is tried to free p

122
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
People's money

123
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
Ruben's website is called air TM it connects you to people anywhere in the world who are willing to trade

124
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Feel like

125
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,191
If you're an American going to Europe and you need some euros

126
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
You can buy them from a guy who wants your dollars

127
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
Enderman is like

128
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,359
I know who would love to trade their currency for dollars

129
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
Venezuelan

130
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,735
Why should they be stuck with money that is melting away in their back pocket

131
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,831
Why should you be tied to any specific type of money if it's not working for you

132
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
3 post an ad on face

133
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
It said something really simple

134
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
Set compradores

135
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Discombobulated

136
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
$5 with Boulevard

137
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,303
Ender TM

138
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Takes

139
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Off

140
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,167
Thousands of people start treating their believe it is $4

141
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
Everyday

142
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
But you can't

143
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,263
Pay for anything in Venezuela with

144
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
US dollars so you just

145
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
Steve in dollars

146
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,663
And then you swap it right back out for believe it is when you need to buy

147
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
Pretty soon Ruben had 25 employees working all over

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,575
The one with the backpack full of cash

149
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
She was the first Air Command

150
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Employee and Ben

151
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,207
And at some point the Venezuelan government starts

152
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
To take notice because

153
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,583
They do not want Venezuelans to have easy access

154
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
$2

155
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
They don't like their people

156
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
To easily train

157
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,983
Their local currency for foreign currency

158
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
And that's because money is

159
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:09,151
Is really only as good as your face in it if you don't believe it has value it won't have value

160
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,015
All of a sudden your whole country starts dumping there where you at is $4

161
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
The boulevard

162
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Will collapse

163
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
And you can see this happen

164
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,439
If you go in RTM people are trading $4 every second

165
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,815
And all those transactions they reveal a really important number

166
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
The exchange rate

167
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
How many bolivares

168
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
People are willing to pay

169
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
For 1

170
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
US dollar

171
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,311
The Venezuelan government takes this number varies

172
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Seriously

173
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,127
Because it's a signal to the world

174
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
How strong or weak your economy is

175
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223
Exchange it is basically

176
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
Their blood

177
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
And they don't want their butt to be diluted

178
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
Rmb worth less

179
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,671
The Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro is like

180
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,743
Hey I determine what our blood is worth

181
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
And today he says

182
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,631
You just need around a hundred and seventy thousand believe it is to buy a

183
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Single

184
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
US dollar

185
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
But the free market

186
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,263
Andhrafriends website says

187
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,055
You actually need

188
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
3 + 1/2

189
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,151
Million what do you want us to buy a dollar

190
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
An economist say

191
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
That's the True Value

192
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Of the body by

193
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,783
Huge blow to my ego

194
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
And so

195
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
Should we allow people

196
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,135
Buy and sell dollars

197
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
At whatever price they like

198
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
And that the controlled price

199
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,303
They don't like us in the team start posting this

200
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
Real exchange rate

201
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Twitter

202
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,447
And now the whole world finds out just how little the boulevard is

203
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Really

204
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
And then

205
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
Jermaine gets a letter

206
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
I was sitting at my desk

207
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Mexico City desk

208
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
And there's an email

209
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
Free official email with

210
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
Functional difference

211
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Color saying

212
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,367
Is this is the Ministry of Finance

213
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
What you doing

214
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
We don't like it

215
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
And

216
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
You got

217
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Stop because if not

218
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
We're going to

219
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
Put in jail from 10 to 5

220
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
15 years

221
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,911
And I think I jumped out of my seat

222
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Excitement

223
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Seaside it's a good day

224
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
I saw this

225
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
Something that was exciting

226
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Surf new

227
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,663
That's what we're doing was not allowed by the government we've always known that's why we exist

228
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
His family

229
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,759
Less excited about the whole Venezuelan prison

230
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
My mom was

231
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
Scared my grandma was like

232
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Stupid

233
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
For doing this

234
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,927
My dad was like

235
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
UK

236
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Yuan Mexico

237
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
When was safe in Mex

238
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Citgo

239
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
But anything

240
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Oh no

241
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
Mila and all of my other employees

242
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
They were right there

243
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Naked

244
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,335
Receive someone knocking the door

245
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Right in that moment

246
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
And that's what I started freaking out

247
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
Rtmp

248
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,599
Romantic Mila stop publishing the exchange rate while

249
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
We try to figure out how to get everyone out of the

250
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,463
They migrated 25p

251
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,791
People either by planes or buy cars buses

252
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
And they

253
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
Call what

254
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Out

255
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
To the Border

256
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Everyone

257
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Except

258
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
I didn't want that I told I remember I told ruin a lot of times when I don't want to

259
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
Eventually she realized

260
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
She had to

261
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
The police

262
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
We're looking for

263
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
To the police were looking for you why

264
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
They say that

265
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
The charts

266
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Fake

267
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
Exchange rate of the dollar

268
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
The reason

269
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
Can I see a hairstyle

270
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,655
Because you were calculating the exchange rate

271
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Like the real exchange rate not the

272
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
The official one that the Minnesota governor

273
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
Right yeah

274
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
That's why we're not using her last

275
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
Chicken and say goodbye to anyone villages

276
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Had to go

277
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,479
With her husband and her seven-month-old son

278
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
I don't know words

279
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
That is no way

280
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
Cookies fight

281
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Malala

282
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
TrueCar

283
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
Her husband's bike

284
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
Apartment in

285
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,095
All her special clothes from special moments in her life

286
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
I wanted

287
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Covering everything

288
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
And I can't

289
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,263
Mila and her family arrived at their hideout

290
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,335
Any super cold town in the mountains

291
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,223
She kept thinking about her sweaters her sweaters that were hanging right there in her closet and got guy

292
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
I made it

293
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,039
Best Buy today

294
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,879
And I didn't have so

295
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,975
Everything you and I felt because I thought that I

296
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
Something like High

297
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
I have like

298
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,351
Victim sweaters in my house and now I need

299
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,519
Urban prep all of his employees into houses just over the Border in Columbia he doesn't want to say exact

300
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
Clearwire

301
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,335
Was just a quiet little place

302
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
In about 2 hours from

303
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
We met there

304
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
Promotional we had this

305
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Alibi party

306
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
He said he had a night at party

307
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
They made a day pass for us

308
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,415
Super nice Alibis are basically Venezuela's national food

309
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
Also

310
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
Kind of Colombia's national food

311
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Was it

312
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
Colombian arepa Venezuelan

313
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,143
Super important question

314
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,703
With a food in Between the Bread

315
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Not at all

316
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,567
For the next couple months all of are GM's Venezuelan employees

317
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Lived

318
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
Together in this

319
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
Safe House

320
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
And they get back to work treating dollars

321
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Is posting prices

322
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,527
It was crowded and stressful but

323
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Everyone had a bed

324
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
Amelia says

325
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
It was worth it

326
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
I always wanted to do something to

327
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Change

328
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
The story

329
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Love my country

330
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,375
And I think that this is a wet vent the better way that I can do that

331
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
Helping the people

332
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,239
They had their way to bring some morning to

333
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Do their house

334
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
When I get a Rapala pressure

335
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,895
When President talks about Venezuela's currency problems

336
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
Cheap places the blame on groups like air TM

337
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
Criminal

338
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Ali Ali

339
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Paralelos

340
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,159
You saying they're not only criminal but perverse and illegal

341
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,207
Which actually makes

342
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Sense

343
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,071
Economist do say that the more people have access to dollars

344
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
The more the boulevarde drops in value

345
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,727
And I wondered what drove in the air TM CEO thought about this

346
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,799
About the idea that RTM is making inflation get worse

347
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
Faster

348
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
And do you think that there's

349
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Who treats tonight

350
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,735
Well we do allow people to exchange their money for dollars

351
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,503
Easier

352
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,063
And so if the government is afraid of

353
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,879
People getting rid of their money easier

354
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Because that will

355
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,231
Make it easier for inflation to

356
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
Horizon

357
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
And to be fair it's not just Robinhood

358
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
People are trading Boulevard is $4

359
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
Street in Border towns

360
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
Anyone in the world who will trade with them

361
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,823
The government has arrested at least 216 people

362
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
For calculating the black market

363
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
Exchange rate and for trading money

364
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
But who is it

365
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,039
Accepting this money who's on the other side who wants believe it is

366
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
For this week all the BS

367
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,391
Sprint on black market exchange rate

368
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Justice

369
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
What one second let me

370
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,815
Steve hanke professor of Applied economics at Johns Hopkins University

371
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,143
Pinky is the guy you call when your currency is losing

372
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Value he's worked with a bunch of

373
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
Even if I said Venezuelan president

374
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
Seconds ago

375
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
Who wants to buy

376
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,335
Boy rides though

377
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
If they're not worth anything

378
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,175
What's in it for the people

379
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
For exchanging the currency

380
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,735
Why would they want

381
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Except that

382
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,623
One group that loves Bolivars is that group that has access to the

383
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
Official exchange rate

384
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,999
These are people that are close to the the regime

385
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
They love body red

386
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
Of course the few

387
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,191
Special people who do have access to the really low exchange rate that my little came up with

388
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
They want what you want

389
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,055
Because they only need a hundred and seventy thousand two

390
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Change for a dollar

391
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
When everyone else needs

392
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
More than three

393
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Million

394
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,991
These people they're called essential follows the plugged in

395
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
People or the Bullet

396
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,879
And this might be one reason why the government would want to keep it

397
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Fake

398
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,975
Low exchange rate because powerful people

399
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
Can make money off of it

400
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
But the government

401
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
They know things

402
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
So they've announced they're just going to

403
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Start over

404
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,775
Scrap the old Willy red and print a brand new one they're calling it The Bolivar soberano

405
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
Sovereign Bolivar

406
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
The plan is to Take 5 zeros off

407
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
The bill so

408
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,967
Imagine you had 500000 what event is

409
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Now you just have five

410
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Pinky says

411
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,367
That will make money easy to carry around again

412
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
But

413
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,719
As far as value it changes absolutely nothing

414
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
It will change nothing was inflation inflation won't change

415
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
Exchange rates won't change

416
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
Hanky says Venezuela should just adopt the US

417
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,263
Currency completely stopped using the Boulevard and officially dollarized

418
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,591
Just replace the local currency to get rid of it

419
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,175
El Salvador uses the dollar Ecuador uses it but

420
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
My little

421
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
He does not want to

422
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,903
I canna plant and imperialists and the Socialist president doesn't want Venezuela

423
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
Become a colony of

424
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Of the dollar

425
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,767
Minnesota

426
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Yes

427
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
But also because

428
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,167
Something really important happens when a government gives up their currency

429
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
They lose their power to

430
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
Print money

431
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
When they need to pay their bills

432
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
But that could happen anyway

433
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,615
No matter what the government wants

434
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,687
If Venezuelans get enough access

435
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
To US dollars

436
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,247
Venezuela could

437
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
Spontaneously dollars

438
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:57,183
Conceivably could this happened in Zimbabwe in November 2008

439
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,999
Zimbabweans stop using the

440
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
Completely stopped they refuse to use the Zimbabwe dollar

441
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
And the economy was totally.

442
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
Spontaneously dollarize

443
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Then

444
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,775
The government was

445
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
Start because no one would use their money

446
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,895
And so they officially dollarized

447
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,223
Mina and her co-workers are still helping Venezuela ends together

448
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
Their hands on dollars

449
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Virtually

450
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
But even though she's doing this work

451
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
Mina does not want Venezuela $2 right

452
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
No you do not want that

453
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
No

454
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Because

455
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559

Wooden dowel

458
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,215
No they will leave it in that we had a hour

459
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
Our currency

460
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,847
Mila hopes she can go back to Venezuela one day

461
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,615
And

462
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
The Bolivar Hermione it isn't just

463
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,247
A piece of paper it isn't even just

464
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
Money

465
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
It's a symbol

466
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,183

Facts about Colombia

489
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
The trash

490
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:46,655
That you have to separate the trash in plastic sanding

491
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
An organic

492
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
I love it

493
