Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm David

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,096
And I'm Jacob

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:08,448
Just a quick note Today Show originally ran in 2012

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,216
The show is

5
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,752
The story of an innovation

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,800
That changed the way the world works

7
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,360
End of the man who made that Innovation possible

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,128
He was a monk

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,408
A mathematician

10
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
A magician

11
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,712
And possibly

12
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,504
The boyfriend of Leonardo.

13
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,160
The man was Luca pacioli and the transformative invention that he brought to the world is

14
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,696
Of course that did it.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,816
And Jacob when I mentioned I remember when we were doing the story

17
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,376
And I mentioned the Planet Money Team that we wanted to do

18
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,936
Show on the birth of modern accounting

19
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,472
Are you joking

20
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,520

A white minister is murdered in

But no one is held to

00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
More than 50 years later we return to the place where

38
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,624
To call Ally Ally

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648

New episodes drop

00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
Or show today is an interview with

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Jane Gleeson White

45
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,424
But she wrote a book a few years back called

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Double Entry

47
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,728
How the merchants of Venice

48
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
Created modern

49
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,544
Jane has an accounting degree

50
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
She just got obsessed

51
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
What's the first thing she pointed out to

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Buses that

53
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,432
In order to have accounting

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,224
There really is something else

55
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
You need to have

56
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Numbers

57
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
And when our story takes place

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Is the 1400

59
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,648
Much of Europe is still using these Roman numerals

60
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,512
But you know I thought Roman numerals must have gone out the Roman Empire that night I lasted well installation

61
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:14,912
So probably Raymond your nose as any schoolchild knows if they've tried to work with them did you contact us

62
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,472
You have to

63
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Adjust

64
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,336
That just like a written language for recording numerals

65
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
So you can't do anything with inside a of these in

66
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,224
Recording thing, you may as well call them into rock

67
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
That's how useful they are well

68
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,088
But we still do that to him

69
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
Hey Jacob think about it right say you have

70
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
426

71
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
Pounds of pepper and you want to write that down

72
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
You would write down and

73
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
Proceed

74
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
DX

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
XVI which is not useful it is really just like you are writing out

76
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
426 in words

77
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
Like f o u r h

78
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,056
H u n d r a

79
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,640
Imagine if you're writing it out of words and you want to do math with

80
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
Udo quick what's

81
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
LX

82
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
IX Plus

83
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
XVIII

84
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
I have no idea

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
Do you have an ending

86
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,672
Are you guys really complicated for merchants cuz like a son wants to buy a certain amount of peppercorns for

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
Or wolf how much is that going to cost that required some math

88
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
And Jane says that was a problem

89
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,728
With the Roman numerals I had to have what they called an abacus but it's not the soda because we can come today because it was a boy

90
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
Water signs

91
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,896
With pebbles on it in The Columns of the unit said that was used for the adding and subtracting so the bank has a much

92
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:34,272
Set around the squares with abacuses adding and subtracting prices and quantities

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,576
But then I had to record

94
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,856
The results of that

95
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Thumbs

96
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
In Roman numerals

97
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
In a scroll

98
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:46,304
And so there was no connection between the working the mathematical working

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,608
And the results are the two things were separated

100
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
What is no Trace

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,496
All of the procedures that have gone on the 14 additional the subtraction

102
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,568
What does it mean on math test when they say show your work

103
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,152
There is no way anybody can ever show their way

104
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432
That you can't show the way

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
Which meant that you couldn't really tell you know if

106
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,296
That being an era or not

107
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,368
But around the time merchants in Europe are picking up on something

108
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
It's being used over in the Middle East

109
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
Arabic numerals

110
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,256
These are one two three four five you know what we all use to

111
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
Jane mentioned

112
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,887
One philosopher in Europe who said Hades numerals their super powerful every every

113
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
Scholarship e-learning them

114
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,751
But the church actually accuse the guy of practicing magic and thin

115
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,591
Simple life in prison for this was like a big controversial development

116
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Are the merchants of the numerals

117
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
We're just super super useful

118
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
It was this new way Ford

119
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
Understanding

120
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Track what was going on in their businesses

121
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
And the center of business at the

122
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
The time in Europe

123
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
Crazy

124
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
Siding and decadent

125
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Venice

126
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Venice

127
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
In that day was

128
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:54,655
I think the equivalent of Silicon Valley and New York also wrapped up together everything

129
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,239
Was happening in Venice it was an incredibly wealthy trading center

130
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,591
Much is from all over the walls from England from Germany from

131
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Holland

132
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
From the Middle East

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,199
The merchants

134
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
Set the international exchange rates

135
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
It's for the whole of Europe and Asia

136
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,367
So it was equivalent to Wall Street but it also is ascenta

137
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
A brand new industry

138
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
Which was the printing press

139
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
You write that it was

140
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Smelly

141
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
There was malaria

142
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,351
Play again it was known as being sexually except

143
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
Yes because of the swamp

144
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
It was

145
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,775
Excessively stinky and they used to put incense and perfume

146
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,079
Around the canals to try and

147
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,895
Reduce the smell was probably I'm sure any minute was

148
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
I was a place of decadence excess

149
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
People had all sorts of

150
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,087
Strange illnesses as well as malaria in which the Physicians

151
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
Put on set sexual excess

152
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
So

153
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,231
What's more I give you Manhattan

154
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
Venice at this time

155
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
It has become the center of this huge

156
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
Trading Network

157
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
You know it's no longer to

158
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,167
Just like little Merchant selling flower to the

159
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,287
Things are ghetto coming on ships and they're coming in from the Middle East and going out to

160
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
England is really this

161
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
Kind of Global Hub

162
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,919
And trading is getting Commerce of getting much more

163
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
Complex businesses are issuing

164
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
Letters of credit

165
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Actually shipping physic

166
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
And Merchants in Venice.

167
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
To keep track of all this

168
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
They're starting to use

169
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,927
A very sophisticated system of

170
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Counting

171
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
The origins of this

172
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,303
Are kind of obscure it seems like the first known use of it is around 1300

173
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
But at this moment in Venice it is really starting to

174
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,703
At the time it was known as Venetian bookkeeping today

175
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
We call it double entry

176
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
Antifreeze Double Entry

177
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,127
That means that everything you do is get centered in two different places

178
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
And so

179
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
To just do an example of this say your

180
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
A spice Trader and you have

181
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
$100 in cash

182
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
$50

183
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
And you said

184
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
$10 worth of

185
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
So you write one entry in your pepper

186
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
Showing that

187
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
Now you have $10

188
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Les pepper

189
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
And then you write another in

190
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Cash account

191
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Showing that now you have

192
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
$10 more in cash

193
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,239
Set this double-entry thing it is basically lets you see what's going on and Oliver

194
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,079
Find accounts and at the end of the day or the month of the year it lets you check all the

195
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
All this Plus

196
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
7 - is

197
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
They should balance out

198
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
That's the double-entry part but really

199
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
The key thing about

200
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
Double Entry bookkeeping

201
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
The bookkeeper

202
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,391
It's a system of precise system for keeping track of

203
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,951
Everything that's going on in your business

204
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:30,047
It's hard to imagine but Jane says that really did not exist

205
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Previously

206
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
The prophet was

207
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,727
Weather in kind you know so you had three extra cause at the end of your.

208
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:44,383
It was obstructed into hot numbers that you can compare with other periods and runny nose

209
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,151
That you had

210
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
Increase your wealth by 2%

211
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
Robin by three cars which is

212
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,039
Beyond measure

213
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
And you can see when you

214
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
You have you don't

215
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
Currency and you have

216
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
Animal skins and you have one you have whatever I mean

217
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,023
If you imagine the universe where people are just keeping track of that by writing in there

218
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Diary

219
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,375
What you're doing before I have this I have that I bought this I saw

220
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
So that in there to sort of writing notes all day

221
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,519
The end of the year would that mean you have your notebook but it's sort of a nightmare to imagine

222
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:16,639
Trying to figure out if you made money if you lost money what what parts of your business made or lost money

223
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:23,551
Yeah absolutely that was the other benefit of double-entry bookkeeping that you could Enlighten my eyes the prophets in each account so you knew which

224
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
Which Wich

225
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
Products you doing well and what she wanted

226
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,487
And then you can start to think about how you would change your business activities

227
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,815
I think it just became one of the better what most scientific

228
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
After the break

229
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375

Okay so now we have the numbers we have some p

252
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
Practicing what we call Modern accounting

253
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
There's one more obstacle

254
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
This big idea

255
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
It needs to get out

256
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
The rest of the world

257
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
And this is where we meet the

Survey Accidental Hero of

259
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,607
Horror Story the name is Luka

260
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
David earlier this year I was doing a story

261
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
Just about taxes it was Tex

262
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
Time and I was interviewing an account

263
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
And I said

264
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,847
Who's like the Michael Jordan or the Muhammad Ali of a cow

265
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
You know who is the greatest

266
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,479
And I'm thinking he's going to give me a partner at some big New York firm or some

267
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
And he says

268
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Luca pacioli

00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
The guy's been dead for like 500

270
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,135
All kinds of things

271
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
He was a monk

272
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
A magician but his

273
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
Real love with numbers

274
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
And math

275
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
Really was a man

276
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
Grows up in a small town

277
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Makes his way

278
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
That is where he

279
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,191
He sees those crazy Arabic number

280
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
He's totally taken with

281
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519

To keep their books

286
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,407
He was so impressed he says it is the best

Is Big role in his

292
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
She writes it down

293
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
60 write down how to do the double

294
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Instructions

295
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Examples

Inside this big

298
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Huge book he's writing

299
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
It's an encyclopedia of math

300
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
That clearly Luca pacioli is not

301
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Thinking of himself as the father of account

302
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,471
He think of himself as this guy who

303
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
Writing an

304
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,335
All math known in Europe at the time and the others

305
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
Little section about accounting I mean the whole book

306
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Giant would be like

307
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
Thousand pages are more

308
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
The title is

309
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551

00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
Hibachi Olney

312
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
Property on nolita

313
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Well done David

314
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,767
And so this book comes out and thanks to the newly invented printing press

315
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
The great technology of its time

316
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,863
This giant book it can be mass-produced

317
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Jane kissing one of the original

318
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
Yeah it's beautiful leather cover

319
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,543
It's so heavy you have to read it in a cradle

320
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,567
It's

321
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,895
The page has a density density written there no

322
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
No gaps

323
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
Between the letters of each word

324
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:38,111
Just run on to the next one there are no gaps between the lie it's almost impossible to read but that was how it was at the time you know.

325
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
Very very early days of printing

326
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
HR

327
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,463
May you know each letter

328
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
It starts a new page

329
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:48,095
Has a woodcut of Luke bachali entwined and it yet very very beautiful

330
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,399
A woodcut of look up a toy like me like a

331
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Picture of him

332
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,239
Yeah but I'm already holding his divided as you know that's mathematical

333
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
Dividers that like come

334
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
How do you make circles with

335
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
I'll let you measure

336
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,639
Circles. He's holding a pair of dividers

337
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
Yes very very beautiful book

338
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,759
Jacob was thinking this is like one of the first coffee

339
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,039
I mean you buy it

340
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Just to have it around to impress people

341
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
It had a math puzzles

342
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Games and it had

343
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
Information on how

344
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
Painters could use math to get

345
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
Relate three-dimensional effects

346
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Perspective

347
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,887
And the book was a really huge hit

348
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
What's the first readers

349
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
Public Utilities encyclopedia

350
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
Was Leonardo da Vinci

351

00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
What's the Last Supper

353
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
Did Leonardo use it to his painting

354
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
Leonardo raisable can thanks

355
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,319
The coolest latest thing it is the coolest latest thing in mathematics

356
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Takes its like the ultra

357
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,951
Cool mathematics text so it stay I can't imagine what that would be today

358
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,047
Leonardo Vinci reads it realizes that

359
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,887
It's really really useful for the mathematics of the Specter that he needs

360
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
To paint his masterpiece

361
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Which is the Last Supper

362
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,519
So look up Charlie arrives in Milan

363
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
Wild Leonardo DaVinci

364
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Is painting

365
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
The Lost supper to help him with the mathematics

366
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
So can we imagine is it is it

367
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,247
Plausible that Patchouli would have liked

368
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
Gone over to where

369
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,623
DaVinci was painting The Last Supper and been like no you need to do the math like this

370
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,415
How to draw the lines like that

371
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,535
Yeah totally that were hanging out together they hung out to you know that live together often I left Milan

372
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
It's very possible that I would love it

373
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
Because they buy and I've had

374
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
Bisexual tendencies

375
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751
Play suddenly spend more time together and definitely

376
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,567
Look up Charlie was there in the actual Church

377
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
When Leonardo da Vinci

378
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,919
Was painting The Last Supper and he was very moved by

379
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
Okay so this book maybe it helped

380
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
At the Last Supper but also of great

381
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
Historical significance

382
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
What Patchouli is known for today

383
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
A different little part of the book

384
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,183
Volume 1 chapter 9 part 11

385
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
The section about double and

386
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
In the Italian

387
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
It is

388
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Kohl's

389
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,655
Particular State computers a scriptures

390
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,751
And it looks as it but the way that it's put into the book

391
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,591
It looks as if it was something he added at the last minute for his Patron

392
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
So that his patrons

393
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,223
Citizens could keep their accounts properly and become wealthy merchants

394
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,783
And one of the first things he writes is like you have to

395
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Merchants you have to

396
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,391
Do an inventory after know what you own and he gives us example of a

397
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
Typical Venetian Merchant

398
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:26,815
Who has to the golden coin cases of Ginger Saxon pepper packages of cinnamon and clove Sandalwood

399
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Boxing shamis

400
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Skins Bank.

401
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,935
If you want something really the whole double enter

402
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Yeah

403
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:39,103
Yeah he shows them exactly how to do it from the beginning so he as you said he wasn't through the whole thing he imagines that

404
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,151
I have never had an account before

405
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
And so the very first thing you do when you like me your books

406
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
Is taking Infantry

407
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,271
And that becomes your capital

408
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
So that is all your wealth

409
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,903
And as anyone knows if a tree's is still in central part of Ryan company

410
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
Luca pacioli publishes this book and

411
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,535
It's sort of an instant headache

412
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
Abroad and people start to

413
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,655
People read that chapter and they they start to use double entry bookkeeping is that what happens

414
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
Yeah so what happens is not funny

415
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,359
Does agar Broad and I read that chapter but that chapter was extracted and turned into a volume of that sign

416
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,919
So not long after he published his book

417
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
The Venetian Empire crumbled

418
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
And the new Center of Trade

419
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
Was what went to Germany and then to Holland

420
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Soaz

421
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:26,463
The centers of trade spread so this new technique was adopted by the merchants in the local

422
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Regions

423
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
So you can see

424
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,071
That this one tiny

425
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
Mechanism that was

426
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,423
Invented initially and codified by Luke

427
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
Patrolling 1494

428
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,287
Spread gradually across the world and by 1900

429
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
It had it was the basis of business

430
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Across the planet

431
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
Which is pretty extraordinary

432
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
What do you think

433
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
Luca pacioli would think of

434
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
The world today

435
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
And double entry bookkeeping

436
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,111
Keeping everywhere not just in every business you know whenever anyone buys a business

437
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
Show me your books

438
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,743
You know she if you have if you have enough you if your stock is sold publicly you have to

439
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,535
You know basically show your book

440
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
A bunch of times a year

441
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:10,239
But also for countries you know countries keep track of their entire economies basically through Double Entry bookkeeping

442
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
What would he think

443
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
I think you'd be absolutely astonished I mean

444
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,151
You know he he as a as an aside

445
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
Codified and published

446
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
27 page

447
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,527
Locating tradus in his beloved mathematical encyclopedia

448
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
And to think that that

449
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
What had gone on to become

450
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
The

451
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:32,255
The governing system of every economy on Earth and every called Corporation every business

452
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:38,911
He would be astonished when he he keep falling backwards nothing

453
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:45,311
Jane writes that the last record we have of Luca pacioli is in 1514 when he took

454
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,127
Good job as a math professor at the University of Rome

455
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,199
He died a few years later probably in 1517

456
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
He was 72 years old you can see a painting of Luca pacioli

457
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
Billy and a photo of his huge

458
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903

Math book

460
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:07,583
On our block npr.org money will also put up a link to Jane Gleason White's book is called double entry how the merch

462
