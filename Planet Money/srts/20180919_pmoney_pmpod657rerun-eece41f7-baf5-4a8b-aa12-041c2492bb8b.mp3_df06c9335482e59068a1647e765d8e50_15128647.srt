00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,864
Hey just a quick note this episode originally aired in 2015

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:10,752
If you find yourself drug around Upstate New York you should stop by the farm of Rick

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,032
Minkus he grows

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,056
One hell of a night

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,104
If you're on the farm you can pull one

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
Write out the ground and take a bite

7
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:23,040
I mean I'm just going for it

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,344
I mean it's very oniony

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
That's what a fresh onion

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,584
For the record we made Keith do that as kind of Planet Money

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
No thanks thanks for that

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,216
Rick is one of the biggest onion farmers in Upstate New York

13
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
Stacy gross

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,288
End of millions of onions each year

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,848
Digress the onions but he is also a business

16
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
What is onions are harvested

17
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,432
They're just a commodity

18
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
He needs to find a market

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
And right now

20
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,272
The market for onion says

21
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
It's $9

22
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,320
450 lb bag

23
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:01,440
$9 is not great but $9 okay we're making money at $9 will start selling but we're not going to go

24
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,768
Crazy so you know when we have bills to pay I mean I have notes doing

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
I might have to get some cash flow

26
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,864
This is how it has always been

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Performers

28
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,192
They're at the mercy of the weather and the soil and

29
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
Are plants during the growing season

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
And then after they harvest the crop

31
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,568
We're at the mercy of financial Market

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
The by the rug

33
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,640
Except for this one time

34
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:26,272
Another farmer from upstate New York broke all the rules and made himself the master of onions

35
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,808
And the master of markets

36
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
He was known as The Onion king of Pine Island

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,672
His farm is a little ways down the road from here

38
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,768
And to this day around these parts you don't want to bring up his name

39
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
Vince kasuga

40
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,864
Have you ever heard of a guy called Vincent kosuga

41
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Skip

42
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,960
Does he have some reputation in this part of the world

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
Yay

44
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,800
He's had a reputation that you don't do business with him

45
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,104
Is it 1 Point

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,688
Vince kasuga held the entire onion World hostage

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,064
You made a fortune doing LOL

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
And I'm Keith Romer today on the show we will tell you just what it took for Vince kasuga to become the onion King

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
And why is Neighbours still resent it

50
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
A story about a scheme that got so out of hand eventually the Chicago River load not just with lock

51
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,704
America's Army

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,008
So many onions

53
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152

Vince kasuga started out as an onion farmer back in the 1930s

64
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
And he was pretty successful at

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,248
But onion farming was never quite enough RAM

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,320
Yeah after you finished working on his own crops he like to make

67
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
Big bats on other

68
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
People crops

69
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
He would pour His onion money

70
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
It was called the

71
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
Futures Trading

72
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
Basically the place where you can make a bat

73
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
That it's going to be a great year for a week

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
Or soybeans I swear to God are going to take a beating

75
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,704
He was just addicted to Trading

76
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,336
He would trade anything I mean know if it moves he would trade it I think he liked the action and I think he liked being right

77
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
This is Harvey path

78
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,712
He's a Commodities Trader in Chicago and the nephew of Vince kasuga

79
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,296
Performance Futures markets are way of taking some of the risk

80
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Out of their business

81
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
Mybatis spring

82
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,648
Right you need money to buy seed

83
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
Attract

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,256
You know you can have a million pounds of onions to sell in 6

85
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
Six months in the fall

86
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
But you need the money now

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
So you agree to lock in a price

88
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
My dog's back

89
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,448
UFC sold contract to deliver the onion

90
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
In the future but you get the money now

91
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
Not only does this let Farmers plan their finances

92
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
It also let them sleep soundly.

93
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,432
If in the fall the price goes down to $6 a bag

94
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
Who cares they're locked in a $9

95
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,784
But you can trade Futures even if you're not

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,088
A farmer there's a whole Exchange in Chicago with

97
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
If you just know in your heart

98
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
The price of onions is going to go up

99
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
You can buy a future country

100
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
The price is low

101
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
You can talk when the price is high

102
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
You can make a fortune

103
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Ford Blues one

104
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
Like Vince kasuga did early on

105
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
When he first started out

106
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
He was trading wheat

107
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
And got annihilated

108
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
I guess he had a mortgage part of his farm and

109
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
He swore on the Bible to my aunt that he would never trade

110
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
Wheat Futures again

111
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
But you notice he just told his wife

112
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Wheat

113
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,111
It wasn't long before Vince must have realized

114
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
What do I know about wheat anyway

115
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
I'm an onion farmer

116
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
I know everything there is to know about onions

117
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
Victim self-hate

118
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:53,631
I know about onions I know about Futures Trading what if I use that knowledge

119
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Pull off

120
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:00,543
The greatest onion tray that the world has ever seen his idea is kind of the fantasy of all Commodities trade

121
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,871
In 1955 he decides that he is going to

122
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
Corner The Onion

123
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
Corner

124
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
The mark

125
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
This is something you mainly hear about

126
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,855
In movies when you need some sort of motivation for the evil guy

127
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,671
You know I just cornered the market in Gold mist

128
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
List of Bond now you will do my bidding

129
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,303
When it's not in the movies this is really hard to do

130
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,655
Cornering the onion Market means that Vince kasuga needs to get his hands on virtually

131
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,703
All of the onions in America

132
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
And

133
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
Guess they figure out where to put them

134
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,079
So is evil plan starts in New York

135
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
With a little construction project

136
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
Well he was building

137
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,759
Was a big shed of corrugated aluminum I mean huge and he had a conveyor near neighbor

138
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Filling it with onions

139
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,391
So he was stockpiling all the onions from his from his farm

140
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
And not just doing it on his own Farm

141
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
All Around The Country Vintner

142
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,255
Starts buying of onions

143
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Millions of

144
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
He was doing this in New York

145
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,887
I understand he was doing it in Michigan taxes

146
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,983
And I think he had a partner to out in California so we're doing this

147
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
Throughout the United States

148
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
Warehouses

149
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
Is everywhere filling up with America

150
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
Is onions

151
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
There's a lot of onions

152
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
I could buy that

153
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,711
Sylveon tattoo do all of this completely in secret

154
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,039
Because if he doesn't and the market finds out what he's up to the price will go

155
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
Up and up and up before you

156
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
The chance to buy all the

157
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,183
And after start stockpiling onions that are already on it

158
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
Looks Francisco

159
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
What about those onions

160
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
That are growing right now and this

161
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
Is where's expertise as a traitor comes in

162
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
Because he is able

163
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
Dubai futuristic

164
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
Essentially saying to Farmers

165
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
As soon as I come out of the ground

166
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
I want to I want to buy

167
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,103
So Vince and his business partner Sam Siegel

168
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Produce distributors

169
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,247
Is a traitor to they start buying up all of the available Futures contracts on onion

170
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,343
It is amazing by the time fall of 1955 rolls around

171
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
Vince kasuga

172
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
Has wrapped up the entire

173
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Tire Mart

174
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
So you want all the lawns in the Futures Market

175
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
Any on wall unions in the United States basically

176
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
He cornered the market

177
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
He did it

178
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
He did it

179
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
And here's why cornering a market is such a big deal

180
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
Vince kasuga

181
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Could set the price for onions

182
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Whatever he wants

183
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
People have to pay

184
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Otherwise

185
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
No onions on your burger

186
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Escallion ring

187
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
So of course

188
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
Vince want the price to go up

189
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
He keeps the onions off the market

190
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,343
He creates an onion shortage

191
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
And then when the price is high enough

192
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
December 1955

193
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
Vince makes his move

194
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
Vincent Sam called a bunch of onion big

195
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,095
Growers Distributors ultimate meeting in Chicago

196
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
They say fellas

197
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
This can go one of two ways

198
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
You can buy a bunch

199
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Are onions

200
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
We've got stored up at

201
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
The price that we demand

202
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Or

203
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,615
We can just dump all these onions on the market all at once

204
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,687
We can destroy the price of onions for the rest of the year

205
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
It's your call

206
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
They don't really have a choice

207
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,367
They are in the onion business and Vince is threatening to blow the whole thing up

208
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,207
In the end they agreed to buy almost 9 million pounds

209
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Onion

210
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Is amazing and Ferb

211
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,839
Pretty much anyone who's ever courted a market this is as far as it goes

212
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,911
He bought all the onions low he drove the price up

213
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
And when it came time to sell he made a killing

214
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
Vince has stopped

215
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Here

216
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
He would have been an absolute Legend

217
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,615
And maybe even a hero to his neighbors

218
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
The man who made onions worth a fortune

219
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Kasuga

220
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Did not stop there

221
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
He didn't just want to make a killing

222
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
He sees that he can make

223
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Two killings

224
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
He has such a powerful hold on America

225
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Is onion Supply

226
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
But there is this

227
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
Second opportunity to make

228
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
Money it's just

229
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
Waiting for him if he plays it right

230
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,655
If you control all of America shenyang

231
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
You can make the price go up when she did

232
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
But you can also make the price go down

233
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
Any thinks about this

234
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
And there is a way in the

235
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Futures Market

236
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
But you can basically short tomorrow

237
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
You can make a big

238
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
That the price will go down and once again

239
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,551
Vince kasuga can make the price go down

240
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
So he starts to quietly make bets

241
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Against the price of a

242
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
That the price will go down

243
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,511
Any bakeries that day after day after day and when March hits

244
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
Vince kasuga Springs

245
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
His second

246
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Trap

247
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
He stabbed his fellow farmers in the back

248
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
Flood the market with onion

249
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
I will wait for the markets

250
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:20,127
We're not meaning this in this theoretical inside markets kind of way no he physically take

251
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
His onion

252
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
From his secret warehouses

253
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
He loads them up

254
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,039
And he basically says to all the other traders in Chicago

255
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Surprise

256
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,135
What they didn't count on was him delivering the onions

257
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
To The Exchange

258
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
But wait a minute this

259
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
Does it mean there are

260
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Physical

261
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,559
Trucks filled with onions driving into downtown Chicago

262
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Correct

263
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
No

264
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Yep

265
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
No where would you put them

266
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
I'll get to that

267
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
Trucks

268
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
Train cars

269
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,823
Vince casuga onions

270
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,151
Coming into Chicago and of course the onion Market goes Haywire

271
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:58,015
Normally if you are Futures Trader and because of your contract you get delivered a bunch of onions

272
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
You just sell them on to someone who wants them

273
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Produce distribute

274
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
That's the way the market normally were

275
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
All these onions coming into Chicago

276
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
The price Falls

277
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
Floor onions are basically

278
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,071
Be worth with no one wants to get stuck

279
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Bazookas onions

280
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
You can imagine all those traitors walking to work

281
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
The streets of Chicago every morning

282
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,543
Seeing these huge bags of onions piled on every loading dock

283
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
The train yards filled with onions

284
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Everywhere

285
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Onions

286
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
The mesh bag that you put 50 lb bag of onions in

287
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
The bag alone empty cost $0.20

288
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
A 50lb bag

289
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
Of onions they went to 10 cents a bag

290
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
As long as there been Futures Trading in onions

291
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,791
No one had ever seen a price that low

292
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
You couldn't sell it

293
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
You could not give them away

294
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,727
So what do you do with your onions you did they called orphanages they called Hospital schools whatever

295
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:54,335
They try to get rid of as many onions as I could and the rest of them they dumped in the Chicago River

296
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,407
And of course there was one man who had made a huge financial bat

297
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
The price of onions would drop to nothing

298
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
And that man was Ben kasuka

299
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
He made a fortune

300
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Made 8 and 1/2 million dollars

301
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
It's a lot of money 1955

302
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
A lot of money now

303
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
And a lot of people took a beating on Svenska

304
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Suga's onion

305
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
Other Commodities Traders

306
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Farmers

307
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,839
Put Canada being able to sell their onions for a profit now we're growing

308
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,911
People went bankrupt because of kasuga

309
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
There were stories of suicide

310
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Yeah I didn't really

311
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,079
Upset and in Michigan they affect called their congressman

312
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
A gentleman by the name of

313
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Gerald Ford

314
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
President and they said

315
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,527
We have got to stop this craziness with the onion futures

316
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,807
What size shirt

317
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
He gets Congress to hold hearings

318
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
Talk to economist

319
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
The onion farmers

320
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
I talked to Uncle Vince

321
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
Bazookas lawyer tell them listen

322
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
No matter what you do

323
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
Do not perjure yourself

324
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
Tupac lie to Congress

325
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
He was on the stand

326
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,959
Raises hand and said your name is consumer he said yes

327
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,311
You said that you live in Pine Island New York yes you have a farm near yes

328
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,175
They should vents be understanding on 97% of the onions in the United States

329
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
He said that's incorrect

330
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
IO 98%

331
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
He corrected them so didn't perjure himself

332
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
That's what I can guessing was in his mind

333
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,719
But after all this outrage it was hard to really pin down the

334
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:21,119
Crime Vincent committed there laws against Market manipulation but they were super vague and hard to enforce and biscuits

335
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,959
He said if it's against the law to make money in the United States and I'm guilty of something

336
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
But of course it is not

337
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
How to make money

338
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,639
Indian kasuga had his training license suspended for 10 months and he had to pay a small fine

339
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:37,759
Like tens of thousands of dollars out of the eight and a half million he made on the trade

340
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
Now at this point Congress

341
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,391
Could have passed the law reforming parts of the onion trading world

342
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,463
Perhaps limiting the amount of the nation's onions that one man

343
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,279
Could own but onion farmers were pissed

344
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,071
Are always complained about Spectre

345
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
City Slickers using the Futures Market

346
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
How to get rich and ruin the little guy

347
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
And now they had proof that speculators

348
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,263
Could destroy an entire Market

349
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
Congress listen to the

350
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,359
The farmers and they chose the nuclear option

351
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
Coming up after the break

352
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455

In 1958 Dwight Eisenhower signed

365
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,095
The onion Futures Act

366
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Which makes it illegal

367
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
To trade onion futures

368
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:27,935
In America

369

Trade Futures in onions and it's the only Agricultural Product that's

00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
Specifically outlawed light

372
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
Like that's the only one

373
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
You can trade in soybeans

374
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,759
Wheat corn no problem but onions

375
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
Forget it

376
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
It's so farmers theoretically should live happily ever after

377
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,903
No speculators to mess around their mark

378
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Except for one thing

379
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Not much

380
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,767
Change the Union Market

381
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,583
The price of onions with steel unexpectedly shootout

382
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
Crash down without warning

383
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Just like it always did

384
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,239
Even without Vince kasuga onion farmer still face the prospect

385
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
I'm making a bunch of money one year

386
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
And losing it all the next

387
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,127
And without Futures there's this slow drip drip

388
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
Drip out of everybody's pockets

389
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,479
If a farmer can't sell is onions ahead of time

390
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
Just to pay the store.

391
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
Because Farmers money

392
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
It cost you money when you're buying onions

393
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,439
Maybe just a few sent an onion but it's money that Congress entry told us that we

394
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Have to wait

395
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
Vince kasuga went back to farm

396
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
Then after his suspension was up after 10 months

397
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
He started trade Futures again

398
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Just another Market

399
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,911
He traded potatoes

400
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Pork belly

401
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,751
His nephew Harvey worked alongside him and said that he

402
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
He would tell

403
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
This onion story

404
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
And other Traders would just

405
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
Marvel at what are you called

406
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Because you can't do that

407
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
You could not Corner the onion Market

408
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Not because of what Congress

409
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,807
Not because of the law

410
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
But because there's so much more information in the market

411
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
Yeah she tried to buy up a ton of

412
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,231
Corn or soybeans first of all

413
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,583
Everyone would know you're out there by and secondly people would see you building the warehouse

414
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
We have just so much more information about the

415
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,727
The Futures Market you would see someone like Vince casuga coming a mile away

416
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,031
His title as the onion King

417
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,847
Is going to be safe for a long long time

418
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
We always love to hear what you

419
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
How to get a shower

420
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
