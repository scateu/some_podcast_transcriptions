Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Elsa Chang

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,376
When Donald Trump was a businessman

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,656
She brought a lot

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,192
Quite often

5
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,240
Common but

6
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,520
What are his businesses

7
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,568
Defaulted on a bunch of those dads

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
It became harder and

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
Harder for him to borrow from a lot of banks

10
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,688
But

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,760
It was one thing that did not run away

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,040
Leaned in

13
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,064
Netbank

14
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
Is Deutsche Bank

15
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,440
Right now house Democrats are trying to get a bunch of records from Deutsche that

16
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,464
Are connected

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
To Trump

18
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,584
It's a conflict that's been playing out in the news and I've been really confused about all the

19
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,376
Which is why

20
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
I was glad our friends at

21
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
Podcast

22
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,216
Trump Inc

23
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,752
From WNYC

24
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:43,776
Publica

25
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,568
I put together an excellent at

26
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,384
So what about the long relationship

27
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,664
The Trump family

28
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Deutsche bank

29
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,760
So we decide to run an edited version of

30
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
Right here

31
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,112
It starts with Trump Inc Andrea Bernstein

32
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,904
Talking about some of Deutsche bank's

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,672
Troubles

34
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,976
Ladies and gentlemen

35
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,512
Very welcome

36
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
In January the head of Deutsche Bank

37
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:11,936
Christian setting did an interview with Uber huesers business editor at the German newspaper decide

38
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,544
The two were speaking at a reception at the world economic Forum in Davos Switzerland

39
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
Do you want it to be

40
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
Become a drone

41
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,664
Pierce user the newspaper man asking the banker

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,944
If you were a journalist

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
How would you report on Deutsche Bank today

44
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
What would you write

45
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,648
Did you eat your CEO was taking a bath

46
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
He fumbles for a moment

47
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,744
I would say Deutsche Bank is

48
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
The most

49
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
Self-help story

50
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,752
A few months earlier the German police have raided the Bank Frankfort headquarters

51
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
It's disappointing

52
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
Not disappointing you know personally

53
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,480
Being subject to investigations and Regulatory actions have become the new normal for Deutsche Bank

54
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,576
In recent years the bank has been fined billions of dollars for lack

55
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
Controls

56
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
On everything from laundering Russian money

57
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,000
Violating sanctions against Iran Libya and Sudan

58
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
Somehow you life is

59
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
Tainted by Deutsche Bank past

60
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
How do you live with the

61
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,168
The constant uncertainty

62
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
That's something that is my papa

63
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
You know I think that makes live really interesting

64
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
By that standard

65
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Life has become

66
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
Burien

67
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,064
Fordite today

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
In a recent court filing

69
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,208
Congress reveal that has been asking for detailed records of

70
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,512
Family business interactions with Deutsche Bank

71
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
In the filing Congress Ed

72
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
It's investigating the relationship

74
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
Four possible money laundering

75
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
Illicit Financial deals

76
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,544
Fraud and foreign influence in the 2016 election

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,224
Bates own admission Deutsche Bank has a history of serious compliance deficiency

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
When it comes to Global money laundering

79
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
In the very recent past

80
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,160
Now comes a new revelation from The New York Times

81
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Scotiabank

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
Own anti-money-laundering

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
Flag multiple suspicious transaction

84
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,376
They were as recent as 2016

85
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
In 2017

86
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
And involved

87
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Trump's business

88
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
And the one formerly run by his son-in-law

89
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
Jared Kushner

90
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592
Among the transactions

91
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,920
One more money had moved from Kushner companies

92
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
Two Russian individuals

93
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,624
The times wrote that don't your bank's money-laundering experts were so concerned

94
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,952
They wanted to report these transactions to the US Treasury

95
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
But supervisors refused

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
To do so

97
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,376
Carrie McEwan Deutsche Bank spokeswoman said in a statement

98
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
Alert disposition

99
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,008
By investigators undergo a higher-level review by qualified staff

100
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,336
Transaction monitoring Castle wide neck

101
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
And not all alerts will result in escalation

102
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,504
She added we take our responsibility for compliance very serious

103
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
I'm at the bank has

104
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,904
Increase our anti Financial crime staff and enhanced is controls in recent years

105
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
A spokesperson for the Trump organization email the

106
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
The statement

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
This story is absolute nonsense

108
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
We have no knowledge

109
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Launch of any flag

110
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,143
Transactions with Deutsche Bank

111
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
In fact

112
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,471
We have no operating accounts with Deutsche Bank

113
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,591
We sent questions to the Kushner company is the White House Trump's private Banker

114
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,151
And lawyers for the trumps and Jared Kushner

115
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,735
The White House did not have comment the others didn't respond

116
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
Meanwhile

117
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
The investigations

118
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,743
Those subpoenas were sent to multiple financial institutions including and Deutsche Bank the house intelligence and

119
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:52,095
Financial services companies are hoping to get information on loans the German Bank gave

120
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
A to the Trump and Trump organization and then

121
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,895
Friends calling harassment of the Trump family and their organization sued Deutsche Bank and Capital One to block subpoena

122
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
Penis into your bank and we are

123
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:11,039
Collecting a lot of the document that we have requested and we are reviewing them

124
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,391
I can only tell you that the investigation came about as a result of the testimony

125
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
Michael Cohen

129
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
Today on the show Trump

130
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
And his family's relationship with Deutsche Bank

131
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
A bank with a history of problems

132
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
They were laundering money

133
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,367
For wealthy Russians and people connected to Putin and the Kremlin

134
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
In a variety of ways

135
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,743
For almost the exact time. They were doing business with Donald

136
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
This is David enrich

137
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
The finance editor of the New York Times

138
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,935
And all of that money through Deutsche Bank was being channeled through the same exact legal entity

139
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
In the US

140
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
That was handling the Donald Trump

141
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,615
And there are a lot of coincidences here there's a lot of smoke

142
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
I have not found any fire

143
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,503
But unfortunately I do not possess subpoena power

144
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,391
We're going to walk you through all that smoke from Pink is an open investigation

145
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,999
So we're just going to say right now we're still not sure what this all adds up to

146
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
What we do now

147
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,167
Trump right now is about 350 million dollars to Deutsche Bank

148
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:37,055
More than he owes to any other financial institution and so much is happening regarding the bank

149
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,895
So fast but we decided to lay out what we have learned

150
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,455
By digging into Trump's Financial deals with the bank

151
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,783
And why his recent loans raise so many question

152
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,599
Questions raised by Congress

153
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
The New York attorney general

154
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183

190
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
Any bank would do

191
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
David and Rich of the times has upcoming book about Joy

192
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:24,575
Dark Tower the inside story of the world's most destructive Bank

193
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
He says

194
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,671
When Deutsche Bank First approached Trump in 1998

195
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,487
Both Trump and the bank needed each other

196
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,047
He was completely frozen out of financial

197
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
Defaulting on loans

198
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
And

199
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
Deutsche Bank in the late 1990s

200
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Was

201
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,727
Very eager to make a name for it so

202
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Self in the United States

203
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,847
So they really needed to go searching on the fringes

204
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
Define clients that were

205
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,503
They had a bunch of money but that their reputations were sufficiently scuffed-up

206
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,343
That they were not suitable clients for the big Elite

207
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Wall Street investment

208
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
And Donald Trump fit that bill.

209
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,047
The bank lend him money for a downtown Manhattan skyscraper in the building across from the UN

210
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
And Trump's business came with

211
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:15,263
He would fly Bankers to Atlantic City for boxing matches take them to the US Open tennis tournament in Queens

212
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Then

213
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
He asked the bank to sell

214
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
High risk

215
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Bonds

216
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Junk bonds

217
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,687
To keep his casinos going

218
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
Sandwiches reporting's on Georgia Bankers initially didn't want to but when Trump dangled the weekend at Mar-A-Lago

219
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
Assault

220
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
480 million dollars

221
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Cinnabons

222
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,791
Everyone is really pleased with the outcome until a few months later

223
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
Donald Trump default

224
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,911
I'm looking for Hans with his guess what everyone had feared would happen in the first

225
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
So

226
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:49,311
There should have long-term reputational risk of selling junk bonds that are in default

227
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Irrelevant

228
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,431
Well thank you everybody it is quite a crowded

229
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
Not too long after

230
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
Trump was once again bound up with Deutsche Bank

231
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
6

232
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
140 million dollars

233
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
Lights for a Trump Tower Chicago

234
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:10,047
Help get the loan he assured Bankers that his daughter Ivanka then a recent college grad would be in charge of the devel

235
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,959
Family was in it for the long haul very very happy with what's happened with respect to this building and

236
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,615
How fast can September 2008

237
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Got this one bill and we're really

238
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
2 months later

239
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Trump default

240
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,623
Did something unusual and on dacious after

241
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,487
Defaulting on the loan Trump sued his lender Deutsche Bank

242
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:45,887
The lawsuit began like this this action arises out of defendant Deutsche bank's attempt to derail the success

243
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:52,287
Well completion of one of the most acclaimed construction projects to be built in the United States in recent times

244
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,687
It went downhill from there complained he couldn't pay back the loan because the financial crisis

245
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:05,087
Was a force measure an act of God that Deutsche Bank was responsible for the crisis anyway

246
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,391
He asked for billions of dollars in Damages

247
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Deutsche Bank suit and back

248
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
The trumps

249
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
Kept selling units in Chicago

250
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,887
In a real estate business the word luxury is terribly overused

251
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,727
It's lost

252
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,311
Ivanka Trump has by now become a key marketer

253
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Action property

254
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,127
Fabulously luxurious

255
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,527
Trump International Hotel & Tower

256
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Chicago's famous Skyline

257
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,135
Finally after a few years the two sides settle

258
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
He's on the hook

259
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
440 million dollars

260
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
Which he personally guaranteed

261
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
He needs to pay that back to Deutsche Bank

262
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
Where does he get the money

263
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,215
This is where they're already strained relationship

264
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,495
It's way stranger

265
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,871
Out of the blue the person who comes to his rescue is his new son-in-law

266
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Jared Kushner

267
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
David enrich of the New York Times

268
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
And he had

269
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,319
Jared Kushner had struck up a relationship with a private Banker at

270
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Band named Rosemary

271
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Do we know how do we know how they met

272
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,511
We don't that is one of the world's greatest Mysteries if you occupy

273
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
My brain

274
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:22,911
What I know is that in probably around the summer of 2011

275
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,983
Jared arrange a meeting for his father-in-law

276
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
To go into Deutsche Bank

277
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
And meet with rosemary

278
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,383
Who at the time was one of the

279
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
The real shining stars

280
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
Deutsche Bank

281
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Private Bank

282
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,855
And private banking is have a weird business than most people who do not

283
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Obsess over the stuff

284
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
I probably never heard of in it

285
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
Part of the bank that caters to the world's richest

286
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,887
The job of a private Banker is usually to help rich people protect their wealth and grow it even more

287
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
To keep tax authorities away from their Investments

288
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
And companies

289
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
Private bankers

290
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,591
Do not usually loan money for a large commercial real estate developer

291
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,455
Rabbit did not respond to our questions for this story

292
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,295
As before Trump showers attention on all the right people

293
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Bradley

294
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
What time is the Trump Tower gets treated like a friend

295
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
There's a favorable profile

296
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:22,303
In one of Jared kushner's newspapers

297
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
And Donald Trump that maybe

298
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,911
This arm of Deutsche Bank the private bank

299
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,495
Can strike up a fresh relationship with Donald Trump

300
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,055
And do what no other bank on Wall Street

301
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,919
What no other bank is willing to do is loan Trump

302
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
48 million dollars

303
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
Taipei off the door Jamaica Chicago loan

304
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,367
Because Trump has defaulted on his loan and Sue the bank for billions of dollars

305
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
But with the help of Rosemary vrablic

306
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,255
He's getting money from Deutsche Bank to pay off Deutsche Bank

307
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
No one is ever seen anything like

308
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
In fact a lot of the people I've talked to at the bank

309
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Previously at the bank

310
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Had

311
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
Initially insisted this just hadn't even happen

312
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
It's not the way work at all

313
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
And it is the way it works

314
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,127
And it just so extraordinary and unusual

315
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
That no one

316
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
Believed it to be possible

317
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Deutsche Bank

318
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,039
Enrich their private wealth unit made money from truck

319
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
Because he opens personal accounts there

320
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Brought them business

321
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
And yet this is

322
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,023
One of the clearest examples I've ever seen a bank that is so dysfunctional

323
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:30,655
And so careless about is risk management and so careless about the reputations of it

324
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Clients

325
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
And so

326
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
Loose with

327
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
The protection of its own reputation that it would allow

328
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
A guy

329
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,687
Who has repeatedly defaulted in burn the bank and caused a huge public embarrassment

330
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
To borrow

331
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,527
Tens of millions of dollars from another arm of the bank

332
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
To repay the part of the bank

333
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
That

334
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,623
Vicki is engaged in litigation

335
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
It is it's

336
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Really mine

337
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
It's not

338
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Just Chicago

339
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,215
Around the time when Deutsche Bank is getting ready to pay off Deutsche Bank

340
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,751
2011

341
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
12

342
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Trump starts

343
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Coveting

344
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
Bankrupt golf course near Miami

345
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Doral

346
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
It has a history of Hosting major tournaments

347
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
MIT post financial crisis

348
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
It's not in great shape

349
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:24,159
And it's in the flight path of the Miami Airport

350
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:29,791
The property itself I was told by people involved in the bankruptcy was kind of a dog

351
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,839
This is Heather Vogel from propublica

352
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,911
She dug into the bankruptcy records and land Deeds for Doral

353
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,983
The sellers were going to go with Trump because

354
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
He was willing to

355
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
Close by with no Finance

356
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,847
Essentially

357
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:48,735
The bankruptcy filing showed that Trump agrees to pay $150 for the whole business

358
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
105 million is for the property in the buildings

359
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
Atlanta record show

360
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,951
And that's where it gets kind of interesting I think because

361
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:04,607
He does not buy the property for all-cash he does need financing and from what we can tell he needs a

362
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
A lot of fun

363
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,215
And for that money he again turns to Deutsche Bank

364
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
Trump flies Rosemary vrablic

365
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
The private bank

366
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
Down to Florida

367
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
And she helps him again

368
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,663
Deutsche Bank loans him 106

369
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Million dollars

370
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,831
Remember the county records show that Trump paid 105 million for the land and buildings portion of the sale

371
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,159
And the sale in the loan are recorded the same week

372
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
To the Moon again

373
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,255
Is for more money that he pays for the property

374
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:37,887
And we are also after digging around found out it wasn't actually the only loan that they gave on this

375
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
Property is another Droid Turbo

376
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
Awesome

377
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,983
My Rosemary

378
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
This one

379
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:48,127
419 million dollars is also backed at least in part by the Doral Golf Course

380
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,783
So that means he's got 125 million dollars in loans on a property that was sold for 100

381
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
5 million

382
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:01,183
Which is certainly not the kind of thing that anybody who's bought a Homewood

383
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Define believable

384
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:07,327
You can't just get a bank to give you all of the money for your house

385
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
There could be an explanation for this

386
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,727
An appraisal showing Doral was worth more or additional collateral

387
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
What we do know

388
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,567
What's in the public records raises the question

389
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,151
Of whether the loan was unusually high for the property

390
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,039
I think that there's a larger context here that's interesting because of Deutsche bank's involvement

391
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:33,695
Which has been accused of not doing enough due diligence in order to spot money laundering and to stop

392
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:40,607
You have Trump who has also been repeatedly accused of not doing due diligence with his Partners has been involved with p

393
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,471
Who have criminal connections for years people with connections to Russia and people with

394
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,775
Connection to illicit activity in Russia

395
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,847
You start had this Nexus of all these different

396
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Actors

397
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:57,503
To have had problems in the past and you've got that the court would appears to be a business decision that doesn't make

398
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
Why would Deutsche Bank

399
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
Lenses much money

400
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
For this property

401
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
The trumps themselves

402
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Spun out yet another story

403
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
Forbes wrote about it

404
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,959
How Ivanka Trump got the Doral Resort and the Blue Monster for a bargain-basement price

405
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
And had a baby at the same time

406
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,055
We got the Ral which is

Trump organization was also tapped for another important detail for the family

411
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:41,023
At a time when the trumps were buying golf courses and thinking farming licensing deals

412
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
It was a development project

413
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
They really want it

414
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887

His history of defaults and Company bankruptcies

425
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,119
Should disqualify

Buys the retail floors of the former New York Times building for just under three hundred million dollars

476
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Then six

477
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,224
18 months later the kushners go to Deutsche Bank

478
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:45,856
To get an appraisal that says the property is worth two hundred million dollars more than they pay

479
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,720
Increase volume was because they were going to get more lucrative tenant

480
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
But anyway

481
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,584
They get a big loan from Deutsche Bank

482
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,912
It's for more than what they first paid for the building

483
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
They walk away

This one's in Turnberry in Scotland

488

And this is the moment inside the bank

489
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,768
Where one senior executive after another realized

490
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
Just how deep

491
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
And

492
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,144

Beginning of the story by the German journalist

508
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,008
Are you sometimes mad at your predecessor

509
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,336

510
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,616
Ditto

511
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
I think

512
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,200
Also that you landed in sports you never look back

513
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
I mean this is setting it doubles again

514
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,064
He saying the bank is trying to turn a corner

515
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
Come clean

You know what you just want to make this

518
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
Bang out again

519
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
A bank which lives up to

520
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
Descendants

521
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
And which has the record

522
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
Education which is used to have

523
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,144
And therefore I'm not looking back I'm not mad at three sisters

524
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,960
I just want to get my job right and at the end

525
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
You know what

526
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
We need to bring

527
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,264
Trifecta.

528
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,384
Today the bank faces an array of potential trap

529
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
For instance

530
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
If Trump

531
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,480
Bolts on his lungs

532
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,760
They have a choice

533
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,600
Seize the assets of the president of the United States

534
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
Or let alone slide

535
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,464
And given unimaginably large gift

536
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,000
