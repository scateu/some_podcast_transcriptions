Progressive capitalism for an age of discontent

5
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,264
By Nobel prize-winning economist

Joseph E stiglitz

7
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,104
We got a brilliant

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,664
Question

9
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,456
A question that spawned

10
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,480
Entire

11
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,088
I asked my dad about a question and he said he couldn't answer it

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,880
So you told me to come in.

13
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:31,232
Amy a thirteen-year-old listener in Bristol England

14
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,304
She listens with her dad and Amy question

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
It's about the government

16
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
10th and

17
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:36,864
What it can

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,632
And spend

19
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Puritas

20
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,448
I had this idea

21
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,496
. because they print money

22
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,288
Instead of giving it

23
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
Back to the bank

24
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,336
Making a

25
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,360
Inflation go up

26
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,200
They could use it just

27
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,016
Republic Services

28
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,832
And it would be much easier and it would be

29
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,416
It would be in general really good cuz I know there's lots of

30
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,720
Problems with like there's not enough

31
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,560
Tax to go around all the schools and hospitals

32
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,864
So I thought maybe this might help

33
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,424
Thank you for listening

34
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
Yeah

35
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Hi

36
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,544
This question is

37
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
Brilliant

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
It has so many ways

39
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,408
Like the first part printing money

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,736
What is stopping the government from printing as much money as it were

41
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,528
Basically nothing

42
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,064
And then the spending Park

43
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
If the government prints money

44
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
Why do we need to take my money in taxes

45
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,464
Amy even calls out

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
Possible

47
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,560
Fatal flaw inflation but she's like

48
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,888
Are we sure that this would cause inflation the answer is

49
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
Nope

50
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
Inflation ain't what it used to be

51
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:50,592
Economist of all ages are rethinking how it works at the heart of Amy's

52
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,384
Question is a paradox

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,712
The government can create money

54
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,552
But the government also says it doesn't have enough money to pay for stuff

55
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:06,208
Does I need to make sense hello and welcome to Planet Money

56
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
The whole show is Amy's Quest

57
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
Can we buy everything we want

58
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,424
And if we try will we be living in a Utopia or an inflation night

59

00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Okay Alex

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
We found the perfect

77
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,640
Person to answer any question she's an economist

78
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
Had a similar question about 20 years ago

79
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
And I'm thinking about it

80
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,784
Her name is Stephanie

81
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Hilton

82
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
So what do you think is Amy is Amy on to something

83
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
You know young people can be so clear-minded

84
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,744
Yeah she said that isn't

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,768
Ratably

86
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,584
Sort of astute way of framing it

87
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
You know the government can fund itself

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,448
By simply issuing the money

89
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:25,056
And Amy has hit on something that is well-known to economist

90
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,104
But it's just the most economist

91
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
Like to say

92
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,456
But that's not really a very serious way of going about things

93
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
But Stephanie is

94
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
Serious she's a professor at Stony Brook University she's one of the leaders of this movement within the left wing

95
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
King of economics

96
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,208
Call Modern monetary Theory

97
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
Or the initials mmt

98
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
And they say the government

99
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:51,936
Could create money and spend more without necessarily raising taxes or causing runaway inflation

100
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,568
If you're wondering before this episode is over we will all scream the word inflation together

101
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Wait for it

102
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
So

103
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,920
13 year old Amy

104
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,760
Her questions let us straight into this whole huge alternate theory of echo

105
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
And at just

106
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Set the right time

107
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,184
M&T is having a moment right now there's a corner of The Economist internet that is like

108
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Cespedes

109
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,512
There are more mmtb blogs

110
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Today then

111
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,655
McDonald's franchise everywhere

112
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
And it's not just the block

113
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
Politicians have been asking

114
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
Stephanie and her colleague

115
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,847
The Advisory Sanders earlier this year she give a keynote in

116
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Parliament in London

117
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,407
In at the House of Lords of Lords

118
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Can't Get Enough

119
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
Most Economist use to ignore these ideas

120
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,063
Is French or far out and a lot of them still do

121
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
Lisa Economist food

122
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
To shrug off these ideas

123
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Going to write about mmt

124
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
And

125
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
Regular people

126
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
More and more of them

127
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:52,863
Are becoming convert every week when Stephanie is talking to a potential new convert

128
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
She often starts

129
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
With the first

130
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
Basic part of Amy's Quest

131
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
About what is money

132
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
Can the government just

133
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
Print as much money as it wants

134
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
I don't like

135
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,407
Phrase printing money I'll just

136
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,735
Laid out there

137
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:15,135
Money because most of money out there is digital not paper here right the way we mostly handle money in our lives

138
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,463
Only numbers taking up and down in my day

139
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,815
Add most of that digital money out there in the world

140
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,631
Actually comes from Banks making loans

141
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
It's where the second explain this one

142
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,519
Different than the way a lot of textbooks talk about it here is the ID

143
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
Say Economist Stephanie Kelton

144
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
Needs $100,000

145
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,151
2

146
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,967
Start a pancake restaurant

147
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
The bank checks out your credit history

148
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
And they're like

149
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
They decide to give me the money

150
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
The loan office

151
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
Will

152
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
Types of numbers into his or her

153
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Computer

154
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,303
And my account balance is going to increase by $100,000

155
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
That is

156
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
Bank officer isn't thinking about

157
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Cash is not

158
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
Going down to the Vault and Counting

159
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
20

160
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:07,103
That's crazy what was she where did the bank get the money to make the loan

161
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,639
I got it from the keyboard

162
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
Who is the one followed by a number of zeros

163
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
Call it the power of the keyboard

164
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,575
Banks have it and Stephanie says

165
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,183
So does the government superpower of the keyboard This is how Stephanie tells the story of governments

166
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,535
When Congress spends money on aircraft carriers or whatever

167
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
They just tell the government's Bank

168
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,143
The Federal Reserve to go and type

169
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
Some money into the account

170
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,495
Of basically wipers making aircraft carrier

171
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
Just type it in

172
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
Society says the question

173
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,151
Can the government afford something

174
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
The answer to that question is always

175
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Yes

176
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,087
So so like can we afford to build

177
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
1000 Newbridge

178
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,487
Yes could we fill all of the potholes in all of New York City if we wanted to

179
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
F chord

180
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
And also by a

181
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,119
100 new aircraft carriers for the military

182
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
You could build a border wall that Trump wants

183
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,983
You can afford it college for everybody

184
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
How do I make a pay for

185
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Affordable

186
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
Sounds like a Utopia

187
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
There has to be

188
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
The Wright brothers

189
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
Okay we're going to go to the cat

190
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Quick asterisk are

191
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:21,087
These mmtb ideas apply only to governments that control their own courage

192
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,671
Currency that's backed by nothing but the government's good name

193
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
It's not pegged to another currency

194
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
And it doesn't work for countries that

195
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
Borrow internet

196
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
So it applies to the US into the UK

197
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
But not say to Greece

198
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Because they use the euro

199
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Hora Venezuela

200
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
Because they have a bunch of debt in US

201
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,103
Right because then Greece and Venezuela can't use the power of the

202
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,663
The keyboard to pay back the debt if any into in the same way

203
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,967
Asterix

204
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
So from here on out let's focus

205
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Is on the US

206
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
And the UK

207
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,087
13 year old Amy after oak leaves

208
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
In the UK

209
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
This all leads us to the next part of our big

210
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Question from

211
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
The government can create money

212
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
What's the point of tok

213
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
Why does the government need to take

214
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
Take my money in taxes

215
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,983
Astoria on taxes that I always had in my head

216
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
It says that the government spends money because you know

217
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,967
That needs a paper aircraft carriers in first grade teachers part of the government's job is to balance the amount of money that it

218
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
Dispense with the amount of money that it

219
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,087
Takes in this the part where you here are you know about Congress fighting over the budget

220
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
Government takes in money in taxes

221
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
And if

222
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
Needs a little extra to borrow some money

223
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,767
And then across town the Federal Reserve a central bank

224
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
They look at the

225
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,351
The health of the overall economy and

226
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
Change interest rates or create

227
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,495
It's money maybe remove some money from circulation to keep the economy in balance

228
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,055
Basically the FED handles that big

229
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
Picture stop light

230
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
Fighting inflation

231
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
And meanwhile

232
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,895
Congress by their craft

233
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,735
But modern monetary Theory says it doesn't have to be this

234
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
Forget everything you know

235
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
Back when Stephanie was a young red suit

236
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
She heard about a different way of looking at them

237
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,463
It was being shopped around by Finance guy named Warren most

238
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
He was looking at this whole system

239
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
The federal government the central bank

240
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
It's like when you're looking at one of those opt

241
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Optical illusion

242
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
Is it a goblet

243
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,031
Or is it two faces staring at each other I always see the faces

244
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,567
He's looking at the sea

245
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
System and it's like

246
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Suddenly

247
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
Macy's the goblet

248
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
You look at it a little differently then

249
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,479
Taxes don't Finance

250
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,039
Spending comes first and taxes

251
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Second

252
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
This got me so let's slow down

253
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
Here's the old lady

254
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Taxes

255
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
Bring in the money

256
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Then government

257
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
Spend that money

258
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
Government just spent

259
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
Power the keyboard

260
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
Then the government

261
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Has something to tap

262
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
He's out there

263
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,287
Stephanie was initially not sold on wine Mozart

264
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
When she was like this sounds fishy

265
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
I'm going to

266
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:56,735
So I spent a number of months reading treasury manuals fed manuals

267
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:02,879
Tracing out all of the balance sheet entries going through the minutiae of how government

268
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,719
Spending and Taxation and financing actually works

269
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,303
I wrote it all down with all the complicating details

270
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:15,679
And I ended up reaching exactly the same conclusion that Warren had reached

271
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,239
When she looks at all the details she's like

272
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Well

273
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
Actually yes

274
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:27,199
This is a valid way of looking at the world throws off the whole way she was thinking about economics

275
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
Economist talking about these ideas thereabouts

276
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,855
Six or seven of them eventually and they become these modern monetary Theory peep

277
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
Mmt crowd is born

278
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,231
These are talking about that at like The Economist bar where you guys are like drinking

279
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Economist

280
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Ears

281
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Poodle

282
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Totally

283
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
Name the cocktail after it

284
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Probably would have called it a

285
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Actually done

286
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,663
So in this mind-bending world

287
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
We still have the question why does

288
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
The government tax

289
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
At all

290
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
Stephanie says one reason

291
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
Taxes

292
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Because

293
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,719
It wants to remove some of the money that it spent into the economy

294
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,767
So that it can guard against

295
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Asterisk

296
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,839
Inflation inflation

297
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
We got there okay

298
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
This is one of the big ideas

299
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Taxes are not for spending

300
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
Taxes are for fighting inflation

301
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
And spending

302
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
That isn't just to buy stuff

303
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
The government needs

304
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
But

305
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
Power of the keyboard

306
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Spending from that

307
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,295
Can be put to use for doing all kinds of good things

308
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,951
Put money into the economy to give it a boost or to help get to Full Employment okay so the government is spending money

309
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
AT&T economy

310
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,743
Spend spend spend

311
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,791
And eventually you're going to need

312
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,071
To train somebody else

313
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,887
And she said you can think of taxes as a way to do that

314
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:55,263
Because I mean you got to have a way to get money out of the economy right and this is a big question that we had about him

315
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
Remind the government

316
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
That it has the power of the keyboard

317
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
Is the government going to go crazy

318
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
And then when you get like

319
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,039
People with wheelbarrows full of cash dumping piles of money on the counter when they want to buy a cup of coffee

320
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
I'm going to start of summer I'd like

321
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Comment of jacks

322
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Come up to this

323
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
And I think I could summarize them sick

324
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
Succinctly by saying

325
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,743
Just like

326
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
Venezuela

327
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
Bymar Germany

328
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Zimbabwe

329
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
DeFelice

330
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,935
Thoughtful

331
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
Objection

332
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Yes

333
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,543
No I mean to vet by country that makes hyperinflation

334
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,615
Serious objections those aren't

335
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
Action that someone who wants to resist

336
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
What they're hearing

337
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
And so they throw out a word

338
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Zimbabwe

339
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
Venezuela

340
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
It's okay if you think

341
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Hyperinflation

342
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,511
Is a necessary result of what I just described

343
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
State government sitting down with it

344
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
It's budget in deciding

345
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,399
How many dollars to write in

346
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
Into each of these lines

347
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,751
You could well get inflation I'm not denying

348
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,335
Federal government could try to spend too much into an economy

349
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,663
That doesn't have the room to absorb

350
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:12,063
That much new spending and you begin to get an inflation, I'm not I'm not suggesting that that can't have

351
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,623
But she thinks it wouldn't necessarily

352
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
And we were like

353
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
Wait but wouldn't it happen if there's just a

354
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,767
Ton more money pumped into an economy then

355
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
Everyone has more money so there never was going to

356
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,119
Spend more money and that is what drives up

357
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
Prices in causes inflation

358
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
If there's more money out there

359
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
Through the government spending

360
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
It's out there and people can do whatever they want with it

361
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
So

362
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:39,711
I'm trying to get my head around like wouldn't wouldn't that cause inflation somehow if everyone a bunch of people have more money because government is spending a bunch

363
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Smart

364
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
Then

365
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,575
Won't they spend that money on stuff and come back on

366
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,951
Where is it we've been doing it. We just did it with a one and a half trillion dollar tax cut

367
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
We did it with the 300 billion

368
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,887
In additional spending we've we've done it and done it and done it where is the inflation from

369
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,423
I don't see it in the UK

370
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
I don't see it in Japan I don't see it in the US

371
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
True

372
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,871
Countries including the US have had a hard time hitting the inflation targets that they want a hit for years

373
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
I just did a whole episode on this

374
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,735
Two weeks ago Stephanie says we shouldn't be freaking out about inflation right now

375
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
But we do need to think about it

376
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,111
Here is her answer to the last part of Amy's question

377
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Should the government create

378
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
As much money as

379
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
The catch

380
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,815
The catch is that all of these things are affordable in money terms

381
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:32,703
But you know I like to sometimes I'll say every economy has its own internal speed

382
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
The speed limit

383
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,663
She says what you need to look at is how much money an economy can absorb before inflation takes

384
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
And the speed limit has to do with what economist

385
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Call real

386
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Resources

387
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
Economy is not

388
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,903
Just money like if you want to build a hospital you can't build it out of money

389
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
You need a concrete and

390
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
Glass and linoleum

391
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Floor and sofas

392
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,047
Waiting room windows IV bags

393
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,655
Hang on those sort of rolling coat rack things

394
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,215
Willow doctors and nurses of course we need them

395
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,287
Stephanie says those things are what create the speed

396
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,847
So say the factory that makes those

397
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,407
Doing things is running at like

398
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
Half the capacity better

399
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,295
Then if the government decides to place a big order for those coat rack things

400
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
Nothing really happens

401
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
They just buy them at the normal price

402
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
Put him in the hospital

403
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
Great great

404
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,255
What if the factory is at full

405
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Then

406
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
The government has to say hey

407
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,143
Spell to our new hospital instead of to your other customers

408
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
And to get them to do it

409
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Still have to pay

410
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Paymore

411
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
That isn't

412
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Prices just went

413
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
And if the government spends so much

414
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,663
Watch that it drives up prices all over the economy

415
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Thatcher inflation

416
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
That's what the government to think about

417
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
Not whether they have enough

418
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Money

419
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,879
But whether there are enough resources in the

420
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Economy at 2

421
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Soak up.

422
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
That is basically your answer

423
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Amy

424
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,303
The government can create money and spend it up to that internal speed

425
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
If you start to get inflation

426
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
That's a sign you might be spending too much

427
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
Maybe you could

428
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
Raise taxes to pull some of that money back in

429
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
But if you don't see inflation

430
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Just go for

431
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
No clearly

432
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,079
Not everyone's

433
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:21,247
This is Tom poly he's an economist he's done work for labor unions

434
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
And he's on the left

435
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
Of the economic

436
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
But he's been a long time.

437
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Travel Anda

438
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,767
And there's also hear the reason we're only hearing from Economist on the left in this episode

439
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
Is that the colonists were researching and writing about this Theory

440
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
They mostly all tend to be on the left

441
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,727
What time should take a more traditional or conservative you they tend to say

442
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,287
You have to think about taxes as a way to finance spending

443
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
That is the responsible way to run a government

444
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:52,735
Modern monetary theory is useful because it points out some flaws in mainstream economics like he thinks that

445
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
Is too obsessed with balanced budgets

446
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
But he has some doubts about mmt

447
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
Big one is the whole taxes

448
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,415
The idea of using taxes to fight in

449
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
Politics doesn't work like that

450
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,303
Pictures of very very contested no one wants their taxes raised

451
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,143
It's very hard for politicians to raise taxes that very slowly

452
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
Do it

453
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Because

454
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,239
Guess what they don't get reelected if they do

455
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
He says it's just not realistic

456
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
Take for the government to react fast enough

457
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Respond to inflate

458
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,127
We put that to Stephanie Kelton

459
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,223
If your concern is that it would be difficult to fight inflation

460
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
By raising taxes that is

461
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,831
Obviously a legitimate concern

462
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:35,487
That it is difficult to get Congress to act quickly to do the right thing and so one of the things that mmt

463
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
Economist have advocated for very long time

464
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
Is finding away

465
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
2

466
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Take the

467
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Of Congress

468
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Of the decision

469
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
In other words

470
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
To make it happen automatically

471
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,967
She says something like this kind of haven't already like when the economy is booming you don't have to spend as much on a

472
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Employment address

473
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
People have jobs

474
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
So spending goes down automatically

475
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
She says do more of

476
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:05,439
Love that more types of taxing and spending that kick in automatically if inflation starts to take

477
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
And also she says

478
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
Is not alone in saying this

479
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Nobody has it

480
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,911
And she thinks the government could spend a lot more money right now and we'd still probably be fine

481
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,519
Okay so we went looking for a way to explain to a 13 year old

482
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:24,383
What are the government can print money to spend on schools and hospitals and not have to raise taxes

483
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
Everytime this branch of economics

484
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
Sonic this movement

485
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,503
Even with a whole new way of looking

486
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
How many were

487
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,599
You see the faces or the goblets you can pick which one you want to see

488
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:37,439
JB say you can make this mental shift about taxes and spending

489
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:43,839
Don't think about them at the way you think about your money in your private life like do I have enough to buy this thing I want to buy

490
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
The government is not

491
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
Lots of Economist agree there by the way

492
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,727
Instead the modern monetary Theory folks they say

493
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
Start thinking about how taxes in

494
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
Affect the big economics

495
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
Like employment and inflation

496
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,431
Three days now it's the Federal Reserve jobs think about that

497
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,991
Kind of just because that's how we set things up

498
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,015
Like way back when

499
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,319
Government spending and

500
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,135
Thing is actually much more direct way to go about

501
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,463
If you want more employment don't fiddle with the interest rate

502
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,023
Hire people are buy things from businesses will hire

503
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,327
There are definitely questions about how this

504
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,447
Far from the mainstream textbook way that most Economist talk about

505
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
And if you think government sucks

506
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,287
You probably aren't loving the

507
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
But there's some logic to the idea that

508
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,151
Congress should be thinking about the big stuff

509
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,431
Is the economy good

510
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
Are people employed

511
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
And

512
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,087
That money isn't just a way to buy aircraft carriers it's way more than that

513
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
That's something the M&T folks want you to keep

514
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,695
Don't just think about money as a

515
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
A scarce resource something you can run out of

516
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,303
Think about what you want money to do

517
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
And go from there

518
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,631
The different starting point for asking the question

519
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Can we have

520
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Like Nu

521
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,591
Hi

522
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,871
Amy is that you

523
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:06,271
Yeah you ask us a question a couple weeks ago it was a really good question and we have an answer for you

524
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
I'm really excited

525
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,879
I'm like she's right because I didn't know that

526
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,231
You're going to get back. I didn't think that this was going to happen

527
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,559
Unfortunately you have to listen to a whole episode of Planet money together

528
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,839
How does that sound

529
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
That's really good

530
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:22,911
Excited

531
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
