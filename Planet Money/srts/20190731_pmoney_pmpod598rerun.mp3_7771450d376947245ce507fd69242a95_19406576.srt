7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,528
We are running to great shows

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,320
Was that we first ran back in 20

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:25,856
This is the second

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,880
On the 1st

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:27,904
We made it back

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,720
Against the entire American economy

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,048
It's a little hard to explain if you haven't heard the first episode

14
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
You might want to go take a listen

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,912
Today we are going to reveal

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:44,032
The results of that bet that Robert Smith and David kestenbaum made back in 2015

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
Here's the episode

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,128
If you heard the last show you know that we hear planet

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
Decided that we wanted to experience firsthand

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
What it was like to short some

21
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,504
Combat against

22
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:54,784
So

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
You probably heard about shorting you know somebody

24
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
Short individual stocks

25
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
They think are going to

26
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
Tank

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
We went big

28
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,280
We should have the entire stock market will one expert called the Armageddon

29
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,816
Yeah the way we put it is

30
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,096
We shorted America

31
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
We bet

32
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
Did the stock market would go down

33
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,496
It's a funny feeling listening to the news when you are short the entire stock

34
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,312
Cuz everyone else is good news is you're bad now

35
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,592
You feel like

36
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:23,456
Like you're on the opposite team is everybody else it's like being a Red Sox fan living in New York

37
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
You feel alone

38
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
It's hard to even have

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,136
Conversations about the Warhol someone's like hey

40
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,208
Yeah that's that's that's great that's good for you

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
I'm really happy

42
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,560
We are not alone

43
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
There are other short sellers

44
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Relatively

45
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Small number

46
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,168
And Heavens read history

47
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
Going way way way back

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,128
Today on the show

49
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920
The story of one man

50
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,968
Who is far as we can tell

51
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,760
What's the very first short-seller

52
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
The very first person to bat

53
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,600
That an individual stock would go down

54
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
It doesn't go out

55
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
And we are going to bring to an end this little experiment of shorting stock market we will tell you how we did

56
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Not very well

The first person shooter stock was apparently this guy named Isaac Lamar

73
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:11,744
He lived

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
Almost 400 years ago

75
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
And his story survives because

76
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
You looked in the Netherlands and Amsterdam

77
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
And the Dutch Dutch read a lot of stuff.

78
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:22,752
Now we don't speak Dutch definitely not old 17th century

79
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Dutch

80
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
But we got some help

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,384
My name is Laura Tatum I'm an economist and historian from the nether

82
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,968
Little told us there are really only barely enough scraps

83
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Piece this whole Story 2

84
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
But from what survive

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,368
Aciclovir seems to have been a guy who when he did something

86
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
He went all the way he went really big

87
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Princeton

88
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
Get 22 children

89
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
Which is

90
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:50,400
Quite something special if he obviously was very wealthy I mean if you if you can Sports

91
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
22 children

92
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
Y YouTube

93
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Just a lot of money

94
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,336
No portraits of Lamar survive but loaded says in his mind he always imagined

95
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
A trim guy dressed in the style of the

96
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
Will clothes maybe a cape

97
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
And a very big

98
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Wide collar

99
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,552
That's what it what I imagine him wearing but

100
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,112
What his face look like

101
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
Will never know

102
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,952
No references to a giant mustache run

103
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
No sorry

104
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
So that's the man

105
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Now for the stock

106
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
The company he would eventually short

107
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
Back in those days there were not a lot of choice

108
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,215
The beginning of the seventeenth Century those on one stock

109
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
It was the first Star Kenosha this out

110
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
It's obvious that there was only one

111
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
That's right

112
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
The first short

113
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
Was on the very first stock

114
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
The company is one that you may remember from high school

115
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
History class

116
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,759
The Dutch eat

117
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
India Company

118
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,343
Think big Wooden Boats pirate ship like things

119
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
Who's with big sales

120
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,415
Making very very dangerous trip

121
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743
Rough Seas to about as far as you can go from the Netherlands

122
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,791
All the way to what day

123
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
And remember this is the 1600s

124
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
400 years ago

125
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
People died at Sea all the time

126
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
Many ships

127
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
Didn't return

128
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
And what were they risking their lives for

129
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Bring back

130
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Spices

131
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:04,895
Pepper

132
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
Also nutmeg mace

133
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,063
Robert I remember hearing about the spice trade in history class at I didn't think much about it cuz you know

134
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
A long time ago everything always seem

135
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,999
But it wasn't until we did the story that I really tried to imagine a world where everyone coveted spice

136
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,327
Would you like hey I got some nutmeg come over I'll cook you dinner

137
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Apparently yes

138
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
That is what it was like

139
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,983
It's amazing what people really like to cook a semi I see recipes from the 17th century

140
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
And they use

141
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,615
Huge amount of nutmeg and pepper in in recipes

142
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,967
He sent me a chicken recipe it does have a ton of spices seems like it would be almost inedible

143
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
That when we say that this is the first

144
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Company

145
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
We mean the first company that resembles what we have today

146
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
A company that issues stock

147
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
So that anyone not just you know

148
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,279
Rich guy who built up a committee but anyone could own a small piece of the cup

149
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
If you only shared

150
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,887
You own a part of the Dutch East India Company

151
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,423
Who ships made it back

152
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
Withhold skilled at nutmeg

153
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
Pepper and mace

154
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
Are the prophets were yours

155
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,383
Legal details of what it meant to own one of these shares were laid out in this giant book called

156
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Capital subscription

157
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
With the names of all the first year home

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,063
The book still exist today they told me it is so historic vet

159
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
If you went to the archives and asked to see it

160
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
They would tell him no

161
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
But it's Pages have been photographed

162
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,231
And we have blood work to read the very first

163
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Okay

164
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:30,399
Also supported hanging from the nephew fancy humbling it and go messy but also the capital

165
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
The Bona Esperanza and the

166
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
Jordan stats from McAllen

167
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Skip ahead of

168
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Xxxii

169
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:40,383
Famous testing today Tacoma 4cly who fail had any blenders all

170
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,991
But this is not even one sentence

171
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,271
I told

172
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,879
Maybe this is enough I recognize the words I recognize the word Committee in it

173
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,231
Commerce and Esperanza Hope that's Cape of Good Hope

174
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
This book contains this

175
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Little line

176
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
Which seems almost like it was an afterthought

177
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
Shares shares of stock

178
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Did the Dutch East India Company

179
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,031
May be transferred from one person to another

180
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,591
And this sentence this sentence is the beginning of

181
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
For centuries

182
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Of craziness

183
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
It is the birth

184
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
What we now call us.

185
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,503
At first only a few shares trade hands

186
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
But then

187
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Catches on

188
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
And the first stock exchange just kind of naturally forms

189
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:27,487
Not a building it happens on a bridge and if this bridge in Amsterdam where Merchants gather to

190
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,071
Do their business they sell grain wine beer Timber

191
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,215
All the sudden there was this new thing that they could sell it so people gravitated to this Marketplace

192
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
And they start selling this

193
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,799
Abstract item that no one ever seen before

194
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Stock

195
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,103
Ownership shares in a cow

196
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,919
There's a description from a little later in history

197
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,455
And how the training might have actually gone

198
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:52,575
It's from a book called confusion of confusions which is a kind of drama written about the stock market

199
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
Negotiate a price one guy would put his hands out

200
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Thumbs up

201
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
And Shout out an offer

202
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,231
And if someone would shut up

203
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
A counter-offer

204
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
And then they do something which

205
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
I don't know if you see

206
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
Today in the stock market anywhere you would then

207
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,887
Slap the guy's hair

208
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
Shuttle buses hand-slapping eunos houses

209
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,847
People shouting prices and another man coming in between and

210
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
Until they

211
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
Cartoon

212
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,199
Agreement elaborate game of patty-cake

213
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,783
To be like

214
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Had to be done

215
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
That's it

216
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
What was the traitor

217
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,671
Wood stand around while they're doing this may we talk about the news of

218
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,975
Like your England Building more ships

219
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,279
And that might push the share price down

220
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Kinda like CNBC today except

221
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
Imagine if the bottom of the screen a very short

222
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Stock ticker

223
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
Cuz there's only one there's only

224
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263
Exactly

225
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
Are the first short sale

226
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
The guy windup betting against

227
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,223
Is it sometimes the case in stories like this the marriage started out on the other side entirely

228
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,295
Pbn has an Insider in fact he was one of the direct

229
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
Pictures of the Dutch East

230
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
One of the founders

231
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,951
And he became embroiled in some sort of dispute with the dutchie

232
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,303
The details are unclear Some surviving documents make it look like

233
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
It might have been over expense receipts

234
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,423
Lamar is one of the directors off and had to use his own money to Builder

235
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
Outfit one of the new ships

236
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
And there was some question

237
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
About some of the marriage

238
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
Something must have gone wrong

239
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
With Isaac Romero

240
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
But we don't know if it was

241
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,967
Oral about a lot of money or is it was just

242
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Small amount of money

243
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Which is a no

244
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
We do know that it was he say he was

245
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,391
Horse out of the Dutch East India Company

246
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
And he was also forced to sign a document

247
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,743
Which said that he would

248
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,583
He promised that he would never again be involved in any kind of Trades

249
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,887
With the East Indies

250
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,191
Sounds pretty serious for a dispute over

251
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Receipts

252
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,543
Yeah but money was a serious business for the four

253
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
For these people

254
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,127
I think it's physical therapist about their life

255
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,199
Where did the Scandal spread and it began to affect

256
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
Every aspect of American Life

257
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
When is church

258
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
His church turned in

259
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
They banned him

260
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
From one of the holiest of ceremonies

261
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Once in a year

262
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,975
They have like the philosopher and

263
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,535
Does a Camaro wasn't allowed anymore to

264
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
Participate in in in this ritual

265
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
That's a serious punishment

266
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
So this must have been upsetting for him

267
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
Basically

268
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,519
The Dutch East India companies calling to question is business ethics

269
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
His churches excluding him

270
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
That's right though

271
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
That was about all he had tried

272
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Plus it's a small town and everyone knows

273
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Everyone knows everyone

274
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
New Isaac Lamar Back Then

275
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,855
I mean he was one of the directions to Dutch East India Company

276
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
It must have been

277
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,463
Gossip in in all the inside of Amsterdam about

278
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
What happens in

279
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
What are you going to do now

280
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,303
What he was going to do

281
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Would make history

282
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
And not in a good way

283
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
La Mer

284
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
Plotted his revenge

285
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
He has to plan to take down

286
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
The Dutch East India Cafe

287
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
Even better

288
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
Make money for himself at the same time

289
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
By placing

290
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,895
I bet that the stock price would go down

291
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
You become the world's first person to short a stock

292
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,527
The bed itself the short was actually fairly

293
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:07,135
Amazingly Amsterdam back then had to kind of rudimentary futures

294
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,767
If you wanted to bet that the price of grain was going to go down in the future you could do that

295
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
So that is basically what exactly married

296
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,143
Not with grain but with shares of the dutchie

297
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
Purviance nerds out there

298
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Exactly what he

299
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
He sold Futures Contract

300
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
Guaranteeing that you could sell the stock at the current price

301
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
At a time in the future

302
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
If the stock dropped in value before then he could

303
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,503
Cheap cell that the price agreed to in the Futures Contract

304
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
And make money

305
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,087
Is it fair to call this the first short

306
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
Overstock

307
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
Oh shirt yeah yeah

308
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,535
Now Lemaire couldn't step out of the bridge and do this himself I mean

309
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Remember he was a

310
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
Former director of the cup

311
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
People might figure out what he was up to

312
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
So

313
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,215
Get a bunch of what load will cause

314
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
Henchman go out and do it for him

315
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
And betting against something was fine

316
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
People didn't have a problem with that

317
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
It was what he did next

318
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
That really got him in trouble

319
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
His henchmen started spreading rumors

320
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
Trying to drive the stock price down

321
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:10,879
Is at things like a week we we heard a ship sunk somewhere off the coast of

322
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,463
Cape of Good Hope or something or

323
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
We are at that

324
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
There's a ship

325
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
And with

326
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,655
Hello. Pepper off the coast of Portugal right now but

327
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,959
But there's some leakage in the ship you know Saturday

328
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
Pepper's really bad quality

329
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:33,407
Stories like this today if these rumors were spreading around I'm sure the company would send out a press release

330
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,855
That is not true these rumors are unfounded or either the captain the ship would be on CNBC satellite hook

331
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
Stop going like nope

332
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
And out of the hole

333
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Pepper's fine

334
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
The background financial information

335
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,303
How long would it take you if you wanted a fact check one of those rumors

336
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,399
We had sent ship to East Asia

337
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:59,007
That will take you 8 months and 8 months back so that 16 months in total

338
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,359
But of course you could try to send a letter to Portugal and end in op

339
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,943
But have any of the Portuguese ships heard anything in about

340
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Isn't that rumor

341
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,527
Double Take a little bit last long

342
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
But

343
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Could you trust it

344
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,135
Some Portuguese say information

345
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
I mean today it's like milliseconds right and back and it was months

346
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
At 6

347
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
The stock price began to draw

348
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,607
The Dutch East India Company knew it had to do some

349
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,959
It needed a show of strength that needed to reassure investors somehow the things were

350
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
So did what any company today

351
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:36,383
The Dutch East India Company said every one of its shareholders we are doing so well

352
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
We are going to give you a special bonus

353
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
They instantly

354
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Announce

355
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
Dividends what's the first dividend of the

356
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
Dutch East India Company

357
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
What happened

358
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
I mean

359
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,975
It wasn't really a great dividends to shareholders of the Dutch East India Company were allowed to collect

360
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
A certain quantity of

361
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Mace

362
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:59,167
And I want to see Senior houses in the Netherlands

What do we have

367
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
What can we

368
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
Distribute

369
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
To our shareholders in

370
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,295
We have a bunch of Mason let's say that they can

371
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
Collective consciousness

372
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
From us

373
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,207
The company also as companies today will do when they are upset with short sellers

374
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,255
Argues for a ban on short sale

375
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
The Dutch East India Company writes a letter

376
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
The government saying

377
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,911
Short Selling was hurting society's most vulnerable people

378
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Widows and orphans

379
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
And their reasoning is that

380
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
There was a large number of

381
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,615
Widows and orphans who invested all their money in in the Dutch East India Company

382
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Is that true

383
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,455
Well there was there were maybe

384
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
Maybe a few widows and orphans so they were back with the same sort of weapons they're fighting back with rumors and innuendo

385
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
Yeah yeah I love it

386
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,999
The Dutch government did Issue a partial ban on short-selling

387
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,791
Annie's aquamira with bar

388
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
From accessing any of the shares

389
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,631
His plan to short the company

390
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
Was a total failure

391
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,471
According to one historian Lamar and his henchman

392
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,055
Lost what today would be 10 or 20 million dollar

393
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
Lamar eventually left

394
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
Basically wanted to ask

395
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,943
And he took up residence in the small Village near

396
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
Ludwick has been there he says

397
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,551
It's pretty but four is a Camaro

398
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
It must have seemed Dreadful

399
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,671
The only surviving document known to be written by is a chimera

400
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
This letter to the mayor of a

401
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,023
Asking for the financial restrictions on him to be

402
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
It mentions that he's been an upstanding member of society mentioned

403
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
22 children

404
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
But as requested

405
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Any guys

406
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
In this little

407
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
The writing on his tombstone

408
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Kind of something else

409
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
Eli Picasa

410
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,127
Exactly mayor

411
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
Call Mom

412
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
Translation

Dear Liza Clemons

00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
Merchants for more than 30 years

00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
Blessed by the Lord

416
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
Gained a lot of money

417
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
And lost it all

418
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
Except for

419
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Alfred

420
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:02,559
It on the house we will dance hits Indonesia who goes to Tennessee September is an existing feeling

421
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,191
The sad thing of course is that he was probably the only the only one who who was convinced that he actually

422
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
Kept his honor because all other people

423
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
Well fountain

424

Xerneas

Would have eventually paid off

431
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
The Dutch East India Company

432
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,647
Collapsed but only after a really long time

433
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
175 years later

434
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,607

452
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,655
It has been can you actually look and see how much the

453
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,447
Stock market has gone up since

454
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
Since we did this

455
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,543
Yeah let's say so

456
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,919
Yeah I think we're at almost almost 6%

457
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
App stock market

458
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
That correct yeah

459
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Which is bad for us

460
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,087
It is bad for the trade

461
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,695
Alright well I think

462
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
I think it's time to end it

463
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Alright

464
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
Well we'll get you out here we currently got

465
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:18,751
Tropicana Hotel check-out I do we had invested about $400 shorting a stock market because the stock

466
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
Market went up about 6% we lost about 6%

467
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
Which was

468
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
22 bucks

469
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
But there's more

470
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,199
Yeah if you added fees

471
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Have to pay to do

472
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,551
The trade we lost more we lost a total of 40

473
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,391
$2 that would be a negative return of about 10%.

474
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
A negative return

475
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Of 10%

476
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
In just 6 weeks

477
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Yeah

478
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
You're fired

479
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,655
You are no longer a money manager

480
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
Let's give it to Stacy

Will give it to Stacey next

482
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,751
Was there at any point

483
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,823
A moment which we could have traded out of the short

484
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
And made money on the

485
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,503
You're the best time would have been if we'd gotten out on February 2nd at 10:06 a.m. and 2 second

486
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,343
The market was down a little bit then we could have made about 4 bucks

487
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Before He Cheats

488
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,183
