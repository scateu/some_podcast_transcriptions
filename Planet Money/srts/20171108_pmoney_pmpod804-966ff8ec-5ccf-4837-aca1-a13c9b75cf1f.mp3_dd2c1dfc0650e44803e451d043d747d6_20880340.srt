1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,328
In the winter of 2010 there was a robbery

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,096
In Detroit

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,888
Robbery at a bank

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,168
Decor jewelry store

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,496
Note these thieves robbed a Radio Shack on Jefferson Avenue

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,800
Two guys Russian holding a 38

7
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,592
They've got plaid laundry bag

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,920
The order the workers at gunpoint into the back room

9
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,480
And they force them to fill up the laundry bags

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,528
With brand new smartphone

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,808
5 days later

12
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
The same guys.

13
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
Take down a T-Mobile store

14
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
On 7 Mile Road

15
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:33,024
3 months later they drive 3 and 1/2 hours to Warren Ohio to Robert RadioShack there

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,304
And then another

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,144
Jack in Highland Park and on and on but only cell phones

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,448
And this is 2010 so you got to think

19
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,728
The Apple 4S

20
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,264
Oh yeah the Galaxy 3

21
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,592
And remember the T-Mobile my touches

22
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,664
I think so but I think I can still make this

23
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,224
Eventually the cops get a break in the

24
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,272
Andy resteghini

25
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
Michael Green

26
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
30 year old

27
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,648
Hold down jobs at Wendy's White Castles

28
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
The ballpark

29
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,232
But eventually found stealing more lucre

30
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,048
So the cops arrest Michael Green any immediate

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,120
He flips he starts naming names of the other guys in

32
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
They all have a nickname

33
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,192
There's nidhi gangs

34
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,544
Krippy and then they're all the Tim's big Tim Middleton baby Tim walz

35
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,408
But the police have a real problem because all they have

36
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,224
Is Michael Green's confession this one guy

37
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,528
And for all the cops know he could be lying

38
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
But green does

39
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,856
Give them something else

40
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
Cell phone

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
Including the phone number of

42
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
Little Tim

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,256
Who's real name is Timothy

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
And green tell the cops

45
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
This guy Little Tim

46
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,888
She's one of the Rings

47
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,240
And that number that one cell phone number

48
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
That

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Is what does

50
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Timothy Carr

51
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
Little Tim cell phone

52
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,176
Give the FBI a way to know

53
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Where he has

54
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,040
Been nearly every minute of every day for months and months

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
And that is how

56
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,976
A guy accused of going on a cell phone robbery spree ends up being screwed by his own self

57
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,840
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

58
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
I'm Elsa Chang and I'm new Elle King

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,936
Are cell phones made feel like

60
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Private

61
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,496
Personal possessions to us

62
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,848
But they are giving away information about us all the time

63
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,200
With every call every text every time we email or stream the video

64
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,760
That phone is pinging off some cell tower

65
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,320
And someone company is recording

66
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
Where We Are

67
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:39,744
Does records get stored for a long time and it turns out it's pretty easy for the government to get a hold of them

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
Today on the show a small-time criminal case

69
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
Kicked up to the Supreme Court

70
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,168
And this case could decide how much privacy we can expect

71
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
For all the footprints We Leave Behind is a digital world

72
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616

It is

87
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
Pretty easy

88
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
Wait for the police to find out where yourself

89
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,248
The biggest cell phone companies have cots

90
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
Contacting them

91
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Time

92
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,624
Trying to get the records of people who they think committed crimes

93
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
The cops don't even need a warrant

94
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
They just need to show up in front of a judge and say

95
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Hey we think maybe

96
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,888
This guy might have committed a crime which is exactly what the police did in the case

97
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Wilton Carpet

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
So

99
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
Forget the lawyer and he's really lucky

100
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,592
He lands one of the top criminal defense lawyers in Detroit a guy named Harold girl with

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
Carol takes a lot of high-profile

102
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,016
But he also gets appointed to represent defendants who can't afford a lawyer

103
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
And that is how he ended up with

104
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,720
Now the case about a string of Radio Shack robberies that's kind of small potatoes for a guy like Harold girl

105
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
In 40 Years of the defense lawyer

106
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
He has represented mob bosses

107
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,863
And drug kingpin

108
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,679
And former Detroit mayors

109
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
He knows all about wires

110
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Jailhouse informant

111
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
Undercover cops

112
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,567
Hannibal

113
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,455
What Harold wasn't expecting was the FBI coming to him and saying

114
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
Yo we have your clients

115
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
Cell phone lot

116
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Location record

117
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
I was

118
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Really

119
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,183
Overwhelmed is it is a is an appropriate word because

120
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
I dealt with it before quite frankly

121
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
And in any of my cases

122
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,935
MetroPCS which is Little Tim cell phone carrier hands over a hundred and twenty seven days

123
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:58,239
Of Tim cell phone data to the FBI

124
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
Nevis is 200 pages

125
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,127
Spreadsheets showing everywhere that little Tim cell phone has been

126
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
At the beginning and at

127
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
The end of every call for 4

128
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,039
Cell towers location data

129
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,343
Longitude and latitude

130
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,487
I'm not sure that I was able to make in a clearer sense of it because

131
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
There was just too much

132
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,095
It was it was too difficult

133
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
To find my way through it

134
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,703
But it was nothing for the FBI because the feds have you

135
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,495
Computer programs that take those

136
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
127 days of data

137
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
And turn it all into

138
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
A map

139
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,175
A map that shows where was

140
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
Can carpet

141
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
And when

142
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
As you can imagine it

143
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,831
Turns out that Radio Shack robbery on

144
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
Jefferson Avenue

145
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
Little Timmy's nearby

146
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
The T-Mobile store robbery on 7 Mile Road

147
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
Little Tim again

148
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,631
Right here by you got it the RadioShack haste in Warren Ohio Wilton was in the area and the Radio Shack hold up

149
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
In Highland Park

150
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
Surprise surprise

151
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Tim Carpenter

152
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
It's not looking good for a little

153
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:09,151
Well his lawyer Harold gurewitz is trying to figure out what to do with all this cell phone data

154
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,199
More of little Tim's friends

155
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
R taco

156
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
And this is their story

157
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
Little Tim was one of the guys

158
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,111
Is in charge it was never one of the guys inside the store with

159
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
The guns

160
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
He was usually waiting outside

161
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Cars

162
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,279
And later he run the bags of these stolen cell phones down with

163
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
Fence and get 10

164
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
$20,000 in exchange now

165
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,959
Normally Harold girl with his lawyer could cast doubt on all this

166
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Because these guys

167
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,055
Have all these reasons to lie but

168
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,407
Tim Carpenter cell phone data backs all the stories up

169
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Do you think this is the evidence that got

170
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,527
Timothy Carpenter convicted ultimately

171
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
I do the answer is yes

172
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
It it's the kind of

173
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Evidence that

174
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,231
In the end it's the most

175
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Difficult

176
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
To argue to a jury

177
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
That they shouldn't

178
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
Credit because

179
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
The records

180
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Are what they are

181
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
And they're presented

182
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,311
With the blessing of an FBI agent who says I'm an expert

183
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
And this is what I think they mean

184
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,711
Alright so Harold loses the case and his client Little Tim get sentenced to

185
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
106

186
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
Teen years in prison

187
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:25,695
Sam be at 116 years because he was convicted on several counts and the sentences couldn't run can

188
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Currently

189
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
So the time added up

190
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
And it might have ended there

191
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,863
But it did in fact this is where things start to look a little

192
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
Brighter

193
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Tim Carpenter

194
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
Because this case

195
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,775
Isn't just about a man knocking over some Radio Shack no

196
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
This is about

197
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Privacy

198
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
End

199
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
It's about our expect

200
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
Patience of privacy

201
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
Should our cell phones yours in mine

202
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
Be permitted to operate as little Park

203
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
Kid sized tracking device

204
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
She's on all of us

205
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
And you know who's

206
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
Really into privacy Noel

207
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
You know who's been looking for the perfect

208
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,023
Test case that could go all the way up to the Supreme Court

209
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
Did you guys see any guess

210
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,375
I am going to guess the AC

211
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
At this point

212
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,775
The ACLU the American civil liberties Union has been watching a bunch of cell phone location data

213
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Cases of prosper

214
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
None of them have made it to the Supreme Court

215
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,455
But for whatever reason the nine justices

216
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
Does decide to hear the cell phone data

217
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
Starring the cell phone robbery

218
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:28,415
The man at the ACLU who has made cell phone privacy his life's obsession

219
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Is a lawyer named Nate

220
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Wessler

221
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Nate wessler

222
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
Swoops onto the carpet

223
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
Staircase to help Harold grow without

224
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,655
Need is not confounded by all the data inside

225
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,703
This is his sweetheart this is what he does

226
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
He does he does reserve the right

227
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
Can be confused by some of little Tim's Behavior

228
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
On one day

229
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
141 calls made or received

230
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
141 calls

231
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
One day he had

232
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
141 calls

233
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,855
That's right because I'm cute on his phone alive not you're not every day was that

234
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
That many

235
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,439
By any means I have no idea why he was on the phone

236
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
That much.

237
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,303
The point is Tim Carpenter did not do himself any favors

238
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Despite being on

239
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
His phone so much

240
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
When you start

241
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
Putting the data together

242
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:15,775
I'm certainly a day's worth a week's worth a month's worth and its case more than 4 months worth

243
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,615
You easily paint a very detailed picture

244
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,919
If someone's comings and goings overtime

245
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
Other patterns of life

246
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
Yeah where they sleep where they go during the

247
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,063
The day who else they're associating with so it starts to

248
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
To really chart quite a detailed

249
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,183
And enrich picture of a person's life

250
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,743
And this is where Nate wessler the lawyer starts

251
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Argument

252
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,839
He says the cops don't just have cell phone dated that ties Little Tim too

253
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
2 crimes

254
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,679
They also have cell phone records that involve a lot of his

255
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
His personal business

256
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
And they argue Tim's personal business

257
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,079
Should be protected from government intrusion the way

258
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,383
Your home is protected from government intrusion

259
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:57,759
Mina police thought you committed a crime and want to break into your apartment they would need a warrant to do that

260
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,575
Which cell phone location data they don't need a

261
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
And needs argument is

262
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
They should get a war

263
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Warrant for that kind of

264
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,535
Information because it to reveal really personal intimate details about someone's life

265
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,607
Details that the government should not have ready access to

266
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,703
Should approve this point he goes digging through Tim Carpenter cell phone data

267
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
What did the feds have on him

268
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
End with an evil person

269
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
He decides to map it out

270
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
The problem is that

271
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,919
The Sheds wild fine with turning over the data

272
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
We're not going to make things

273
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Easy for the Opera

274
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
When the government turned over these records

275
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,647
To mr. Carpenter's defense attorney is part of the pre-trial Discovery process

276
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
They just gave them a

277
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,463
Disturbia scan

278
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,023
PDF not an Excel spreadsheet

279
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,375
Which meant that when when we got them from the defense attorney

280
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
We had to have our team

281
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:53,567
Painstakingly enter those numbers into an Excel spreadsheet

282
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,383
It was a long process they were

283
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
So diligent

284
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Anticipation

285
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
What is the wallabies poor interns

286
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
Sitting through 7000 lines of mind-numbing

287
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Data

288
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,391
Did you start to put a picture together of Tim Carpenters life

289
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
Babe actually learn two things about him

290
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
The first

291
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
He probably would never guess Noel

292
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
Apparently Tim Carpenter

293
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
What is a churchgoer

294
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:21,471
I guess you missed the sermon about not stealing cell phones from Radio Shack name is that one but he apparently went to church

295
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
And they want another little

296
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
One night

297
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
Tim Carpenter slept somewhere

298
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
Other than he

299
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:32,991
Pata Tim

300
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Tim's boots

301
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:40,671
Cell phone now we're getting into it and that is the point Nate wessler says this is

302
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Personal

303
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,791
And that is why the government shouldn't have a right to get this information so easily

304
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,351
Timothy Carpenter's life on a day-to-day basis

305
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Pretty boring

306
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
In the way that all of our lives

307
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
Are pretty boring on a day-to-day basis

308
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
We get up in the morning

309
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:56,799
Breakfast

310
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
We might see a friend

311
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
We go to work

312
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
Or meet up with a family member

313
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
We all have routines

314
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
The point us here

315
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
None of us in our daily lives

316
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,855
As boring or interesting as they might happen to be

317
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Expect

318
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
The Bears

319
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,719
Little government agent sitting in our pocket

320
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
With a notepad

321
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
Writing down

322
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,559
A record of everywhere we've come and gone

323
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
Over the course of that day and that we

324
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
Very scary thought

325
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,239
MSM turf

326
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
That is in some way

327
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
What are cell phones

328
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
Have become an and have allowed

329
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
I love that smirk

330
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,759
Government agent was the thing that popped

331
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:44,159
Words can be scary that's what Tim Carpenters lawyers are arguing they are saying

332
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:49,023
Your cell phone can turn into a government agent almost anytime the government

333
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:53,375
A government agent who can take a time machine and travel

334
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Cast to monitor your movements

335
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,959
Twenty-four hours a day

336
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
I need you to never sleeps never gets

337
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
Board never needs a lunch break

338
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
And never ever ever

339
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Single mom

340
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
And they're saying that should

341
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
Scare the hell out of

342
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
That's the stuff of

343
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
Dystopian fiction

344
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
That's the stuff of 1984

345
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
That kind of

346
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
Pervasive all powerful government in that suit of power

347
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,719
It's really just what the framers of

348
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,511
The Constitution were concerned about

349
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
They were well familiar

350
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
With

351
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,375
The English king's forces

352
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,935
Knocking down every door in a neighborhood looking for 1/4

353
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
Particular suspect overbroad searches

354
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
And they

355
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Created the Fourth Amendment

356
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,871
Specifically to restrain government investigator

357
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,503
The fourth amendment is the one that says you ever right against unreasonable searches and seizures

358
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,623
And the carpenter case is all about how you interpret the 4th amendment in the age of

359
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
Cell phones

360
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,207
And because the fourth amendment is such a major part of

361
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
Eva legal argument here

362
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
I called this guy

363
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:59,167
I'm a fourth amendment nerd is that what I could say I'm up for thematic scholar criminal procedure Professor I write a lot of

364
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,751
That's encouraged George Washington

365
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:09,151
Christian I meant we can because I wanted to talk to someone on the government side and nobody was actually in the government would talk to

366
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
About this case

367
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
So I turned orange because he filed a brief

368
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
Supporting the government

369
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
Emigrant doesn't usually side with the government but in this case he thinks all this talk about 1984 and it

370
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
Dystopian future

371
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:27,071
Is actually just people being paranoid and a little bit ridiculous

372
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
You said that argument sounds to him

373
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,167
Why are you not disturbed by this

374
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,519
Practice how could you allow it

375
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
The way torun sees it

376
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,847
This is the big

377
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,407
Picture argument against Tim Carpenter

378
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,455
Is it cell site location records

379
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Basically just

380
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Simulate

381
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,831
What's publicly observable in the physical world anyway

382
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:53,439
So you can see in front of your own at exactly and just like I can expect to have privacy

383
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Ephraim feh

384
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
A neighbor who

385
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
Snoops on even more

386
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Window

387
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,607
I should expect that no one can watch me when I

388
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,423
Walking around outside while carrying my cell phone

389
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,751
The fact that somebody left their house walked out into the world that

390
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,799
There's a certain amount of information that's not

391
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
Traditionally protected under the Fourth Amendment

392
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
And that would be it

393
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
Someone could easily watch you leave your house

394
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:19,807
And watch you go to work and it's not like there's a fourth amendment intrusion if that person were to report

395
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,855
Police that he saw you leave your house and go to work

396
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
Right all right so

397
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,463
Cell phone location is data that reveals

398
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,279
Nothing more than what and eyewitness

399
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,095
Like a Snoopy neighbor or one of the ladies from church

400
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Christine anyway in public

401
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
That is argument number one

402
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
And there's a second argument here and it has

403
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
What to do with

404
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Consent

405
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,127
With something that you and me and everybody else out there are

406
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
Huntington

407
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
Every single day

408
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
That's right

409
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,783
There is information that we voluntarily give up

410
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
2/3 /

411
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
Be so we can communicate with

412
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
Yeah when I write a letter and I

413
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Putting address on the

414
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
Or I dial cell phone

415
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:03,839
I am sharing that information with a third-party with the postman or with the phone come

416
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,399
Because I want to be able to communicate

417
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,983
Soup that address that phone number that's not private anymore

418
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
And with cell phone location data

419
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
There's a similar

420
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
Your phone needs to

421
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
Ping against a cell tower in order

422
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
To work

423
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,711
And the argument is the phone company

424
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
Has a right to keep a record of all those pink

425
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
And do whatever it wants with those record

426
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
But if you don't want the government

427
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Hands on your

428
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
Cell phone location records

429
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
There is an option

430
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
For you

431
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
You can just

432
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
Turn off your phone

433
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Forever

434
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,351
Is that feasible

435
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
I mean

436
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:42,495
Is that how we should live to carry cell phones turned off most of the time if we wanted for

437
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,031
The privacy of our movement

438
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
I think it's a lot like

439
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,615
The physical World Imagine you decided

440
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
You didn't want

441
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
People to be watching

442
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Out in public

443
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
What would your options be

444
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,831
You have pretty limited options write your option would be the not go outside

445
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
Which is a really bad option

446
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Yeah yes

447
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,463
Confining yourself to your home does not sound like a very good on you

448
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
But then at the same time we don't say

449
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,815
Okay well since you don't want to be stuck in your head

450
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,911
You should be able to walk outside and be entitled to all the privacy

451
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Yuan

452
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,751
You can't tell people when you're walking down the street

453
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Don't look at me

454
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Believe me I've wanted

455
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,151
But when were talking about the digital world

456
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
What county is

457
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
Walking outside

458
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
At everything about you about

459
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,599
All the footprints We Leave Behind when we use technology

460
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,391
When we use the internet

461
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
How many of those footprints

462
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
Should be private

463
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,767
How easy should it be for the government

464
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
Dulce

465
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Any of those

466
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,399
These are questions the Supreme Court might touch upon

467
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
Admiral argument

468
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:50,335
At the end of this month and part of the reason that little Tim Carpenters case got kicked all the way up to the Supreme Court is that it's not just

469
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
What about are smart

470
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,479
Everything is smart these days there are smart fridges that know how much bacon we eat

471
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,319
They're so smart watches that collect data on how fast are hardest

472
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,135
And Tim Carpenters lawyer Nate wessler thought of

473
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Another one that

474
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
Internet connected vibrators

475
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
Incredibly

476
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:12,095
That upload to a company servers information about someone's sexual activity

477
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
You know that I started my

478
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
End

479
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,103
I love about the law

480
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
You start with this

481
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,919
Tiny criminal case in Detroit

482
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
Ate a bunch of robbers

483
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,503
Hauling away cell phones in laundry

484
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
Taking out a bunch of

485
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
RadioShack

486
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,879
And it sounds like kind of a nothing

487
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
At first

488
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,439
But now it's gone

489
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
All the way to the

490
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
Supreme Court

491
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
And have implications

492
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
Every single one of us

493
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863
Since you are a lawyer

494
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,911
There's a question about this has been driving me now

495
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Since the beginning

496
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,775
Let's say that the Supreme Court rules in favor of Timothy Carpenter

497
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,383
Does he get out of jail does he then get to ditch 216 year sentence

498
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Well

499
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
It's not

500
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
Because of another small part of

501
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
Call the good faith

502
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:04,831
Which was like this

503
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
If the police

504
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
Follow the rules

505
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,951
When they got evidence to convict you of a crime

506
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
And then those rules

507
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,535
Change after your conviction

508
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
Unfortunately for you

509
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
Your conviction still stand

510
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,167
So why the world has this

511
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,007
Fascinating conversation about the future of privacy rules

512
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
Little Tim Carpenter is

513
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
Probably stuck in prison for the rest

514

All right soon as well

539
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,999
You once had a cell phone number that was

540
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,559
Clearly inherited from someone else

541
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,399
And you would get calls all the time for some woman named

542
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,191
Yeah I get them like

543
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:02,591
Once or twice a month and I got a little bit of someone who is Rachel and why did she leave her phone number and

544
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,407
Closest I got I think Rachel Olson people some money

545
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
So we got a little

546
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,527
Who has Tim Carpenter's phone number now

547
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,343
Is he the Rachel in someone else's life

548
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
His phone numbers in

549
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,391
Record

Get sent to prison for armed robbery

554
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,472
