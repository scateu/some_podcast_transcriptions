1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:07,168
College students may not know it but for the past few years they've had a secret Guardian at the Consumer Finance

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,192
Protection Bureau

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:08,960
The cfpb

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,240
Sethrak

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,568
His job has been to make sure students who

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,104
Take out student loans

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
Don't get ripped off

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,688
Financial companies

9
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,712
Debt collectors

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,504
Or even the Federal

11
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,296
His job has been

12
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:27,904
To be a whistleblower the whole cfpb is an agency of whistleblowers

13
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,696
But one day set says

14
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,232
He was told to

15
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
Just

16
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,792
Not send out a report

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,584
He was told to

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,864
Stop whistling

19
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,680
It was so clear to us at this was like

20
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:42,240
The first lock pulled out of that

21
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,032
Jenga game

22
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:49,408
Where you could just see that just you could like almost Envision it that day of watching how all of

23
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,480
The pieces were going to be pulled out until a kind of people down

24
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,528
Ceph started typing a letter that

25
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
When he wasn't sure he

26
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
You never send

27
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,624
You know the letter

28
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,672
That one that lives in our dress folder

29
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:05,536
You been it makes you feel better don't put an email in the address line so you don't accidentally

30
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
Send it

31
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,352
Yap Seth was writing

32
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
That letter

33
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
But one day

34
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
He realized

35
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,472
Oh I have to send

36
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
Send this letter

37
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,288
When you left for work that Monday morning

38
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,312
He told his daughter

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,128
I think I might be able to take you to the playground today

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,152
Like

41
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,968
He might get walked out of the office with his things in a box

42
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
What a centrally told her was

43
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,832
That there was a good chance I would be home early that day

44
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,160
Cuz I didn't know it was going to happen I didn't know if I was going to press send and just be

45
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
He told to go home

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,256
I didn't know I didn't know which way

47
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
Way2go

48
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,328
That's because in this letter

49
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
Seth told his boss

50
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,400
You have abandoned

51
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
Student Borrowers

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
You've used a federal agency

53
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
Serve the wishes

54
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,056
The most powerful Financial companies in America

55
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,872
Insecticides to send this letter

56
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
From his office

57
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
She walks into work

58
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
On August 27th

59
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,016

MBA education sector

72
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
I was prepared

73
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
That

74
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,824
After I press send that I would

75
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,712
Be quickly leaving the bureau and be the last time that I step foot there and I had to make peace with that

76
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Sarah Gonzalez

77
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
PR and I've been investigating the student loan

78
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Today on the show

79
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
A letter

80
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
You may not know it

81
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
But the federal government has

82
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Become

83
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,168
Potentially one of the biggest banks in the country

84
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:52,032
The Department of Education has lent out over a trillion dollars to

85
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Two students

86
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
A trillion dollars in student loans

87
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
NSF rapmon says

88
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,712
It's not clear who is overseeing this Bank

89
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
And young People's Credit is being totally

90
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040
Ruined

91
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,624
Because the education department wasn't built

92
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
To be a bank

93
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,768
This message comes from NPR sponsor

Capital One

Capital One

104
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
To understand why sets

105
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
Letter matters

106
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
You have to understand

107
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
Why the cfpb exist

108
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
Why there is this whole

109
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,784
Unit dedicated to student loans

110
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,600
When we took out our feet

111
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
Federal student loan

112
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,928
We borrowed money from Big Financial,

113
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Thanks

114
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
Yeah I'm

115
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:47,328
Still paying my student loans off those Banks

116
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
But we're paid by the government

117
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
To do this

118
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
To lend us money

119
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,216
But when the financial crisis

120
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Isis hit

121
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,008
It slipped

122
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
This whole student loan industry on its head

123
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
President Obama said

124
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,688
He thinks we don't actually need you you're just the middleman

125
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,480
So we kick them out

126
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,576
Federal government took over a hundred billion dollars

127
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
An existing student loan

128
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
NSAID

129
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
From now on

130
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
We will ensue

131
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
Beatification to park

132
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
The

133
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
Bank of Education

134
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,983
But the department has never really been a bank before they're not built to be a banker and educator

135
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
Vision Department

136
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,567
They literally do not have the capacity to

137
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,871
Process the monthly payment

138
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
Of 44 million student Borrowers

139
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,015
That's how many there are it's more than 10% of the country

140
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
So President Obama was like

141
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Middleman

142
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
We do still need

143
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,207
Someone needs to answer the phone mail the paperwork

144
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,511
Collect the money you know pink things

145
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
The government now

146
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
Paisley

147
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
Big Financial companies

148
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
To be

149
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,191
Glorified record Keepers in debt collector

150
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Except

151
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,823
Really powerful glorified record Keepers in debt collectors who

152
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:07,199
Determine how much students pay each month and have the power to ding their credit

153
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
If they miss a payment

154
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
And student Borrowers

155
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,087
A Miss payment

156
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
A lot

157
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,951
Every 28 seconds a student borrower defaults

158
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
They can't pay their loans

159
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Every

160
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
28 second

161
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:26,143
Student borrowers hold more Consumer Debt than anyone else

162
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Except homeowners

163
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,751
And young people have never had this much debt before

164
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
And one law professor at Harvard

165
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
She saw all this coming

166
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
She asked

167
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
Who's looking out for borrower

168
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
There should be like

169
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
Whole new federal agency

170
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,575
For this and as the education department is

171
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Coming this

172
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,415
Trillion-dollar bank that law professor at Harvard

173
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
Gets her shots

174
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,047
To build this new agency the cfpb

175
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Our newest

176
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Federal agent

177
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
That professor

178
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,871
Hi this is Sarah this is Sarah High Senator Warren

179
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,223
Now Senator Elizabeth Warren welcome back to Planet Money

180
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
Thank you it's good to be here

181
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
Her job was to hire everybody

182
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
She got a small office in the treasury Department

183
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,927
Just a desk and a coat rack

184
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,719
With one thing on it

185
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
An Old Fashioned

186
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
Police cap

187
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,583
Cop on the beach

188
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,679
Tim Geithner gave it to me the Secretary of Treasury

189
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,495
He said this is what you wanted

190
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
And

191
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,591
He handed me that you said you need to be dressed for this

192
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Did you wear it

193
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
What's in a while only once in awhile

194
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
Elizabeth Warren

195
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:44,991
Created

196
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:49,599
Seth brought man's entire student loan unit other units too but this one

197
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
Was for college.

198
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,671
To give them some confidence

199
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,023
That when you sign a piece of paper on the student one if there's not something

200
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
Barry back on page

201
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,095
32

202
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Disconnect

203
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
Blowed and

204
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
Choose your future

205
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
You are like the cop of

206
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Fine print

207
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,591
I like that I like that

208
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,431
And her job was to recruit all the other cops of

209
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Fine print

210
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,271
And starting a brand-new agency means

211
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
Holding your meetings

212
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
Out by the elevator

213
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
What's the biggest space we had

214
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,975
Would be a ding in the elevator door would open and

215
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
People would look at us like we're all crazy

216
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,375
The cfpb was the kind of place where employees would introduce themselves as

217
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,191
Steve employee number 7 and

218
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
Elizabeth

219
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,311
Warren employee number 1 I believe that I was

220
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,615
Like employee number 90

221
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
This is Seth frotman

222
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,223
The guy who CC Congress on his resignation letter

223
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,319
When you became a student loan Watchdog it cfpb 3 years

224
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,135
Before that he was looking out for military

225
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,463
And once he gets to the student loan unit

226
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
He realizes that

227
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:05,631
These companies the government contracts with the glorified record Keepers and debt collectors

228
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
They're making

229
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
Ton of mistakes

230
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
Violating laws

231
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
Example College.

232
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,799
Later joined the military and got

233
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,567
Disabled

234
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,895
They're supposed to get their loans completely forgiven

235
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
These companies

236
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
I didn't forgive them

237
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
And it destroyed their credit

238
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
There's a lawsuit about

239
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,087
The cfpb has actually returned

240
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
750 million dollars

241
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
Strong

242
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Student Borrowers

243
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,791
Seth and the cfpb have been calling everyone out on a bunch of things

244
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,631
And all this is happening under the Obama Administration

245
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,703
These were not things that were necessarily warmly

246
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
Create it

247
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,567
By the Obama Administration

248
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,151
The cfpb is supposed to be apolitical

249
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,175
Their independence

250
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
They don't work for any president

251
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
Until

252
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
It kind of started feeling like they did

253
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,647
After the break

254
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,695
Everything Changes

After Donald Trump becomes president

269
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,655
Keypoint Mick Mulvaney to be Seth frotman boss

270
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
Stop Mulvaney is a former,

271
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Who has

272
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
Does talked for years

273
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
About how much he hates

274
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
The cfpb

275
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
Harry is in a 2014 inter

276
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
It has

277
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
No accountability to anybody

278
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
Turns up

279
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:01,087
Being a joke and that's what the cfpb really has been in in a in a in a 6 and kind of way

280
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,391
A lot of conservatives feel this way

281
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
Washington doesn't need more bureaucracy

282
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
More regulation

283
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:14,143
Mulvaney says the cfpb has been over reaching all these years ignoring the letter of the law

284
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,703
And the changes start with something

285
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
Kind of small

286
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Spending

287
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
Hundreds

288
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
Of hours

289
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
On things like

290
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Changing the name

291
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
What do you mean spending

292
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,759
Hundreds of hours changing the name like the name of a report

293
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Changing the name of

294
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
The bureau

295
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,647
One of Mick Mulvaney's first big moves in Consumer Financial Protection

296
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Rename the age

297
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
So what is the name now

298
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,047
Why aren't you going to say it

299
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,655
Kurai Consumer Finance Protection Bureau OK Google Vini

300
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,239
Learns that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

301
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
Is actually served

302
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
Who is to have been called

303
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:58,175
The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection according to the language in the statue

304
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,015
But poor Mick can't get anyone to call it by its new name

305
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,623
I can't get anybody to call the Bureau of Consumer this is Mick on CNBC

306
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
Because you have tried to change

307
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
The name of this you want to change the name

308
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
Well it's some other things as well but yeah that's a start

309
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
Set the guy who had the bags of all are

310
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,679
Disabled military student Borrowers

311
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
He is now

312
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
Sorting through anything that has

313
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
Cfpb written on it

314
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
And told

315
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Wagon

316
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
We're going to have to change it to BCF

317
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
And that is like

318
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,015
Okay mental note this is weird

319
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
But he keeps going

320
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,599
Until that first log

321
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Comes out of the gym

322
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
It's wobbling

323
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
And this

324
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,023
Is when Seth starts turning all those mental notes

325
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
What letter

326
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,095
American families need an independent

327
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Consumer Bureau

328
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
To look out for them when lenders pull

329
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,983
Posh products and then one day stuff starts thinking

330
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
I might actually send this letter

331
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
He's just finished this big report

332
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
It's about Banks paying colleges millions of dollars

333
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
Words to push debit cards

334
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,759
Like students here by these get these credit cards

335
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Graffiti shirt

336
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:13,183
Okay free t-shirt your first bankcard not necessarily a problem

337
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,743
But some of these cards have crazy fees

338
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,583
He's like you get multiple overdraft fees in one day and they're each

339
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
$35

340
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
Some of these Arrangements were

341
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
So

342
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,359
You can imagine what I'm going to say but where are the schools actually got

343
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
More money

344
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,455
The more in debt their students were

345
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271
It also is likely illegal

346
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
Under current federal regulations

347
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,647
As on the books by the Department of Education

348
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
You said the word you were going to say was effed up

349
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:51,583
It's funny I was thinking predatory

350
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
That tells you a lot of hurt me and sicker

351
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,215
But when he hands the report Inn

352
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
He stole

353
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Thanks

354
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
Yeah but we're not going to do

355
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
You had the report you showed it to all your people that you were supposed how did you find out that that report wasn't going to

356
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
Go out into the world

357
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
Was there a moment

358
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
I think we were just two

359
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Curtis Mayfield

360
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
Burgess.

361
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
How like

362
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,047
Like what like in an email in Georgia

363
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Part with gun

364
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
Okay to be fair

365
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,935
Debit Card issues might not

366
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
Technically be part of sex

367
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Stop

368
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
He's the student loan guy

369
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:38,175
But the way set season the federal government is loaning students money to go to college

370
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
And then allowing Banks to suck

371
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,783
All that money away in debit card fee

372
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,087
Because he's thinking this is exactly my job

373
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
He adds one more line

374
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,439
After 10 months under your leadership

375
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
It has become

376
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,303
Clear that can be a good time for the cfpb

377
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
Stop going after violations because

378
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
There's a big problem Brewing

379
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
It's been brewing for

380
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
10 years

381
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
End

382
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
It's about to boil over

383
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Loan forgiven

384
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
At the end of the Bush Administration

385
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Congress ad

386
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
If you become a teacher

387
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
Aura firefly

388
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
Spider cop

389
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,271
Any public service job

390
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
We're going to forgive your loans

391
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
In 10 years

392
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
As long as you make your payments

393
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
That's our big thank you to you

394
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
Pretty wasn't the clearest thank you because

395
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
Beautification Department didn't actually tell p

396
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,375
People what path they needed to go down to

397
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
To get this great thank you money

398
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:35,519
And the companies that the government pays to manage these loans

399
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,615
I don't really have an incentive to help students sort through this

400
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Complicated

401
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
Path to thank you money

402
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,223
You look at a dollar or two a month

403
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Per-student

404
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
For $2 a month

405
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,855
I want to do a lot of paperwork or spend a lot of time on the phone

406
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,719
And obviously if the loan is Forgiven their pay goes down to $0 a month

407
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,791
So you can see why there's an incentive to keep students

408
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
Confused and pain

409
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,191
It's not a great system and by the way I've spent a lot of time and

410
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
Trying to get these services

411
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
To talk to me

412
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
But they don't really talk

413
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
I have though

414
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,127
Heard from a lot of students

415
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,431
Who thought they were going to get their loans forgiven

416
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
But they're not

417
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
Student like Sarah Cronin

418
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,855
Been in public service for 6 years and she's thinking

419
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,671
I'm only 4 years away from my thank you money

420
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
And then

421
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
One day

422
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
She called the education department

423
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
And someone there

424
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Said

425
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,887
I'm really sorry I know your service

426
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,215
Hold you you qualify for Public service loan forgiveness

427
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
But you don't

428
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,543
She said yeah it really sucks

429
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
And I just hearing her say that

430
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
In a way was a relief I mean it wasn't

431
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
6 years worth of

432
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
But it was a little bit of

433
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
I need a confirmation that

434
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
This is not really the way things are

435
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,951
Post to be there were 29000a play

436
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,743
Applications for loan forgiveness in the past

437
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
And 99% of them

438
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Were denied

439
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,607
99%

440
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,215
See that's actually a huge relief because I walk around with enormous

441
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Amount of

442
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
Feeling silly

443
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
The education department

444
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,871
They say everybody who is eligible

445
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
Who is being approved

446
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
Still they say they will work on improving the process

447
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Meanwhile

448
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
Set start

449
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
Realizing

450
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
You can either keep his job

451
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,879
Or she can help borrowers like Sarah

452
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
He's got to do it from the out

453
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
So he

454
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,999
Finishes his letter

455
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,583
The bureau has abandoned the very consumers it is passed by Congress

456
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
With protecting and he sends it

457
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,191
1700 G Street Northwest Washington DC

458
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
Hoping it will

459
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,031
Galvanized States

460
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:48,383
If there is any upside of what I did it's a recognition

461
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
4

462
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,783
Anyone who has any sort of power if your state legislature if you are a state attorney general

463
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:00,927
To look around and figure out how you could help a population of 44 million people that

464
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Desperately needs it

465
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,279
15 Senators have told Seth's old Boston

466
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,863
That quashed report about Banks ripping off college students

467
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,887
If it exists

468
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
We need to see it

469
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,983
And states are telling the education department

470
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
If you're not going to protect our students

471
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,311
We will

472
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
They're suing these loan servicer

473
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,735
Even reliably conservative States like Montana Kansas and Texas

474
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
Are telling the government

475
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,831
Stop protecting these services

476
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,719
But the Trump Administration is saying leave our services alone we're policing them just fine

477
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,023
Besides syrup our employees

478
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
And we say they're exempt

479
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
From state laws and lawsuit

480
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
You can't

481
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
Sue them States

482
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
The federal government

483
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,287
Isn't only walking away from the fight

484
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,895
To help student loan borrowers they are actually are mean the other side

485
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
Here's where we're at

486
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
The education department is now a bank

487
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
1 + 1/2

488
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,319
Trillion-dollar

489
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,135
And this Bank wants to regulate it

490
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
No wheat

491
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
Seems a little off

492
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Cuz

493
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:11,071
What other banks are allowed to regulate themselves and then there are the companies that work

494
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:15,167
For the Department states are saying they're making mistakes and they're breaking laws

495
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,703
Do something about it trumpet

496
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,495
Administration and they're being told

497
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Stay out of it states

498
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
So

499
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
This is our new system

500
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,687
It kind of goes back to Senator Elizabeth Warren's cop hat

501
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,991
No one's really wearing it right now

502
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,807
And you could describe that as a

503
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
Truly free market or

504
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Total chaos

505
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,559
By the way since you started listening to this episode

506
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,399
41 student borrowers have defaulted on their loans

507
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:54,079
We heard back from the cfpb they say that while they disagree with the assertion then sets letter they wish

508
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,151
