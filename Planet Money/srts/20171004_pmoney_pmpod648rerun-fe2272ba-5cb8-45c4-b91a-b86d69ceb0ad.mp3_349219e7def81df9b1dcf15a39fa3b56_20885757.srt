00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,048
Hate Stacey Vanek Smith here

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:06,912
Today's episode is a rerun for support of the story back in 2015

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,704
We have a little update for you at the end

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:14,336
A few years ago if you lived in Charlotte North Carolina and you bought your first house

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,408
There was a store you could go to get just about everything you need

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,712
A dishwasher a nice flat screen

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,528
A refrigerator even

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,880
Appliances

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
You want one of those

10
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,488
Charlotte is known as the Queen City

11
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,560
And Queen City appliances was an institution

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,608
This family-owned business

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,400
Hatts17 stores

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,472
And then one day in 2012

15
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,776
Word got around town the Queen City

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,360
And on February 2nd a story ran in the local

17
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,128
Paper

18
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,176
After 60 years in business

19
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,456
The store had filed

20
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
For bankruptcy

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,040
This is something that happens every day in this country

22
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,576
Last year we look

23
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,392
Sup 34000 companies

24
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,928
Could not pay their bills

25
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
And went bankrupt

26
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,744
Bankruptcy scenes in

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
Give me feels like

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
This terrible icky thing

29
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,376
But some people will tell you it's one of the greatest things

30
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
About this

31
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056

That is ready player

46
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
CEO of Queens

47
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,936
I went to visit him in Charlotte

48
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
He is super friendly and charismatic

49
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,056
And he kept offering to warm up by coffee

50
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
He did it for you

51
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Oh thank you

52
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,432
Making friends in Charlotte I really like coffee

53
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
Coratti's dad actually started

54
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
Queen City Appliance

55
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,088
Andrade showed me an old photo of him at an

56
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
Early trade show

57
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,928
Standing next to an actual celebrity

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,512
Dentist picture back in the 50s that my dad with Miss America

59
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,960
Stop and come out of the service you can see their two

60
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,288
Body actually spent a few minutes examining this picture

61
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,128
And she was not looking at Miss America he was looking at the old TV

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,688
Trying to figure out what model it was

63
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,040
He's got this encyclopedic knowledge of televisions and appliances

64
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
He has been in this business

65
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
A long time

66
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:12,512
Sweeping the floors and I was eight years old and work on a delivery trucks and I was 12 or 13 years old and then send you

67
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,352
Graduate high school you can get on the sales floor so that summarize on the sales floor

68
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:21,728
Roddy eventually went on to business school and when his dad died right he became the CEO of

69
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
Clean City

70
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
The family business

71
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
Was in his hands

72
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,360
And for a while business was great

73
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Charlotte

74
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,456
Booming and riding his family did what a lot of

75
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
Business owners where do

76
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Doing at the time

77
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,552
They borrowed money and expanded

78
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
Ashley Barros

79
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
A lot of

80
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
And they expanded a lot

81
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
Queen City went from 8 stores

82
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,488
17 stores

83
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
Venom 2009

84
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
You see where this is

85
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
The housing bubble

86
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
No new homes no one was buying

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Refrigerators

88
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Dishwashers

89
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Used mattresses

90
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
Sales

91
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Kept dropping

92
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
And dropping

93
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
And dropping

94
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
I want to call the eternal optimist but I always felt

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,432
Just couldn't get any worse and couldn't get any worse and couldn't get any worse

96
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
And well

97
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
It did get worse

98
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
The math just didn't add up anymore

99
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
The money from sales just

100
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Was it enough

101
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
To pay the bills

102
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
He's going to have to do the thing that had been

103
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
Deep in the back of his mind

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
For a while

105
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,839
The thing that any small business is trying to avoid especially a family business

106
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Bankruptcy

107
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
Bankruptcy is a grueling process

108
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
There are a lot of stuff

109
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
The first thing you have to do is call a lawyer

110
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
And then you have to sign all of these papers with

111
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Any of the other owners of the business

112
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
In this case

113
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
That was Ronnie's mother

114
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Francis player

115
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Who is 83 years old

116
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,831
The time and they went to the office together and

117
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Filled out the paper

118
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
They filed for bankruptcy

119
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
And that moment when you file for bankruptcy

120
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,303
Everything Changes I hadn't actually appreciated this

121
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,095
But when you file for bankruptcy

122
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Public and all the details

123
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
Cause of your failure are also

124
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,775
It's there in the court papers for anyone to read

125
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
How much you owe Who You Are

126
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:07,967
It's all out there for anyone to see and just minutes after riding is Mom filed the documents

127
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
The Charlotte Observer publisher

128
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
The short story online

129
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
Rodney's phone started ringing off the

130
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
His son who is away at college

131
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Also saw the news

132
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
Any new things are difficult for us but I don't

133
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
I think

134
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:27,679
The dinosaur filing at the public Airwaves and you know he sent me a text simplenote

135
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Uok

136
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
Rowdy was not okay

137
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,871
In fact even now when he talks about the bankruptcy his whole demeanor changes

138
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
He looks down he starts fiddling with things

139
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
Gets quieter

140
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,551
He told me that day that he filed for bankruptcy was one of the worst days of

141
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,647
You know your friends your neighbors is difficult

142
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
I walk around town when you got something like that hanging over your head

143
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Ronnie's mom Frances

144
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,047
Had an especially hard time

145
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
She had helped start this business

146
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
60 years

147
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Before

148
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
She still work there four days a week

149
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
In accounts

150
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
And for her bankruptcy

151
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
Was just not something

152
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
I really did struggle with it lost a lot of sleep over

153
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,527
Not easy to get up and go to church that Sunday morning it really wants on after it came out in the newspaper

154
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
This was a terrible moment for rowdy

155
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
And his family

156
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
In most countries

157
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
This would have been the end of the story

158
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,559
Are the banks and his creditors would have come in and repossess the ranges that

159
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Reset

160
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,375
Everything would have shut down

161
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
And all the pieces of the business

162
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
This would have been sold often

163
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
That would have been it

164
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
But in the United States there is another path

165
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Chapter 11

166
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
As in Chapter 11

167
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Of the bankruptcy

168
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
And it is a wafer

169
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Companies

170
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
They can't pay their bills to

171
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Not die

172
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
To keep going

173
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
Any idea predates

174
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,647
Appliance stores buy a lot actually it goes back to the railroad

175
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,463
That we learned this from historian David skeel

176
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:59,327
I have been studying bankruptcy about 30 years I just fell in love

177
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
I fell in love

178
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
Have not fallen out of love ever since

179
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
In the 1800's

180
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
Railroads

181
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,055
We're going bankrupt all the time

182
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,895
In the 19th century nearly every time we had a major economic

183
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
Crisis

184
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223
A large number of railroads

185
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,319
Would fail at one point in the late 19th century almost 20%

186
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,879
Of all of the railroad track in the

187
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
What the country

188
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Had failed

189
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
I had to fall to head

190
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,279
And one particular railroad got into big trouble

191
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
The Wabash River

192
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
Then it ran from Buffalo New York

193
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
Out to sync

194
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
The owners had borrowed a lot of money

195
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
To lay the track

196
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,519
Then the economy hit

197
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
And suddenly the Wabash rail line was in

198
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Big trouble

199
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
It couldn't pay its debt

200
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
But nobody wanted the railroads to actually go out of

201
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
If you double the money and they

202
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:56,159
Pay you back sure you could I don't know I guess go and see is a bunch of railroad track and melt it down and sell it or something

203
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Message

204
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,583
Where you really wanted was to have a functioning railroad that's where the value was

205
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,887
Scaring people and cattle and grain

206
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,007
And if that happens if you get the railroad up and running again maybe you could actually get your money back

207
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
And then Yuan

208
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
Everyone

209
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
Really would be better off

210
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,151
Keeping the railroads open was in everyone's interest

211
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
So instead of

212
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,039
You know shutting down the railroad or everyone rushing in to see what p

213
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
I could get everyone got together

214
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
All the people that loan money to the railroads

215
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,559
The people who ran the railroads got together and worked out a deal a way to forgive some of the money the railroads own

216
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
So don't mind could stay open and they could have finished

217
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
We get more their money back

218
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,495
School says this was a major economic

219
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Innovation

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
That was unprecedented

221
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
In well test

222
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,967
No other country had had a system like this that was designed that the shutdown substantial

223
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
Businesses when they failed but but the reorganized

224
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,575
To give them another chance

225
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
So what did

226
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
The world's think of this

227
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
New kind of bankruptcy

228
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,791
What I thought we were crazy as they often do

229
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,399
You can kind of see their point if you set up a system where when companies sort of screw up and you for

230
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Forgive a bunch of debt

231
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
And you let them

232
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,799
Keep going you might end up creating this whole environment where businesses just do

233
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Crazy risk

234
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:22,175
He things you can end up encouraging the kind of thing you really want to avoid

235
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,503
Turn America we came down on the side allowing bankrupt

236
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Is 2/2 a sec

237
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,135
And when ready player file for bankruptcy that's what he decided he wanted

238
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
To try and

239
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:37,023
When you file for bankruptcy it's like hitting a big pause button

240
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
All the people you owe money to

241
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
For a moment

242
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
You don't have to pay

243
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,935
But you do have to make a list for the court

244
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
Of everyone you owe money

245
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Everyone

246
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
Roddy's list

247
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
133

248
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
You showed it to me

249
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,175
General electric companies on here for

250
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,831
In a $556,000 here's a freight company AAA Cooper Road 865

251
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
$1,000 to

252
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
Okay here's a $40 customer refund

253
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
In all

254
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
Rowdy was millions of dollars in

255
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
I mean in this is

256
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
A small biz

257
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
Business that's that's a lot of washers

258
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,119
And dryers

259
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,959
Yeah and the odds for a company like Queen City appliances

260
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
Emerging from bankruptcy

261
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
CR not good

262
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
For small companies

263
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
Only about 20%

264
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Make it out

265
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Queen City Appliance

266
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
To stay alive Rowdy was going to happen

267
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
To convince

268
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,015
General Electric and whirlpool

269
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
And the banks you're a bunch of money to

270
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
That they would be better off

271
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
If they allowed him to

272
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Keep his doors open

273
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
He's going to have to convince them

274
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,279
And he was going to have to convince in this is really important

275
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Adjudge

276
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
The judge place

277
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
Huge roll in Bangkok

278
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,679
We tried to talk to the judge in rotties case and

279
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
She wouldn't talk to us

280
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
Common with judges

281
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
But we did find a judge who would

282
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
Bankruptcy judge in California

283
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Her name is Deborah

284
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,663
Bruce Altman and she ran through the obstacles that right

285
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,271
She said one of the reasons it is so hard for small companies to make it out

286
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,831
Bankruptcy is it a lot of them go bankrupt

287
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
For really good reason

288
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
Not every business is meant to reorganize

289
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,023
Yeah I think about when I was a new lawyer you back in

290
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
The late 90s

291
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,863
The cases I was working on

292
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
Where are music stores

293
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Like record stores

294
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
CDs that's just out of business

295
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,031
So it for a company like that

296
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,871
Your bankruptcy isn't going to help a business that just fundamentally

297
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
Can't be successful in this economy

298
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:34,015
Ronnie was going to have to put forward a specific plan and who

299
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Would be painful

300
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,903
In court there would be an actual vote where all the people he owed money

301
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
With this side

302
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
Yes or no

303
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Surety in

304
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
Queen City Appliance

305
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
Given a second chance

306
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
If they go to yes

307
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
Andrade would actually have to make it

308
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,447
It works meet specific learning targets

309
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
And along the way

310
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
Every little decision he was going to make

311
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,591
Had to be okayed by whirlpool

312
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
NGE

313
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
Everyone he owed money to

314
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,711
And Deborah Saltzman the judge says

315
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
A lot of CEOs just really

316
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Can't handle this

317
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
I think

318
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,671
That for a CEO or someone who's used to running a corporation

319
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,487
He's probably had a fair amount of success given

320
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,327
Terranea Corporation to find yourself in financial distress is already

321
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Pretty jarring

322
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,679
If you find yourself in bankruptcy court you have

323
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
Really a whole new world that you

324
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
Never been prepared for

325
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
Suddenly

326
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,823
Your decisions are subject to

327
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Court oversight

328
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
Are there public

329
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:38,271
And any of your creditors can hear about what you're planning to do and object to it

330
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
So that is what Roddy was up at

331
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,111
After the initial filing

332
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
The Court gives you a little time to get up

333
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
Plan together business plan

334
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
And for the moment you can keep your doors

335
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
But immediately after that

336
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
Every decision Rowdy made needed Court

337
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
You have to get approval to pay his elect

338
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Chrissy Bell

339
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,239
Had to get a special approve loan to do that

340
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,055
Even had to get approval to put gas in the delivery

341
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,431
So this is the weird feeling on the one hand they file for bankruptcy

342
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
On the other hand they still had hope

343
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
We could still be open for business

344
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,087
Bob one worked in customer relations

345
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Answering a

346
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
Customers are actually calling us

347
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
Having heard it on the news and

348
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
They were

349
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
A bunch of concerned customers and

350
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,583
We just tried to assure them that

351
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
We were still here working through it

352
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,935
We were answering the phones in the lights were on

353
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
Bob says some customers just called

354
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
To say good luck

355
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
We're rooting for you

356
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
Thanks USA

357
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,591
Come on down

358
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
Combined dryer

359
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,687
Restart to draw up that plan to submit to court

360
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,759
Explain how he was going to fix the business

361
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
He hired a turnaround expert

362
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
Look through his books

363
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
And was very blunt

364
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
Mark Holden

365
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
You want to make it out of bankruptcy

366
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
Do you want to be profitable again

367
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
You're going to have to close some of your 17

368
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,607
I still have nightmares about that cuz we

369
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:02,239
You know I had to Lemon a lot of jobs and then you sit across the table from somebody tell him that you have to let him go

370
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
And I can really really hurt you in his car as you to be honest with you I still to this day think about those those time things

371
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
How many stores do you have now

372
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
We got four store

373
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,551
17 stores to four stores is a lot fewer

374
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,111
But it's a lot more than zero with

375
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
Would have been the alternative

376
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Rowdy Hetzel layoffs

377
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
100

378
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
30 employees

379
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
But 75

380
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
Still got to stay with him

381
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,375
Body found his plan for how he was going to fix

382
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
All of his creditors

383
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
People he owed money to G

384
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
GE the banks

385
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
Electric Company

386
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
They all voted

387
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
And they said

388
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
Okay

389
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
Will give this a shot

390
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
Not everyone was going to get their money back

391
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,015
The local newspaper that he'd advertised then when things were very good got it

392
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
Tenth of what they roll

393
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,623
Whirlpool and GE were higher up in the pecking order

394
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,183
We get paid but it would take a while

395
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
Rowdy himself had put a bunch of money into the couple

396
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
And he wasn't going to

397
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
Backpack

398
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,351
Ronnie ran his four remaining stores as efficiently

399
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Trying to cut costs

400
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
At every possible

401
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,495
Turn and also trying to sell as many stoves and

402
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Refrigerators

403
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,335
Every week he had to submit a

404
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Progress report

405
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
To the court

406
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
To show how much money was going out and how much money was going in

407
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:19,295
Queen City appliances was in bankruptcy for a year-and-a-half

408
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,135
But on August 27th 2013

409
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
It was over

410
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Right.

411
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
An official document from the court

412
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
Saying is company was no longer

413
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
Bankruptcy

414
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
Actually he was waiting for it for

415
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,679
Take a few extra days and I thought it was but

416
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,543
Free checking your email like every 2 seconds

417
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
That was the highlight

418
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Process

419
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,223
It is like the shortest legal document I have ever read

420
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,319
There's a speaker official-looking Court seal in one corner and there's just one sentence

421
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
It says

422
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,415
The chapter 11 case of the above named debtor

423
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
Is closed

424
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
Rottie threw a party for his staff

425
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,607
He showed them a documentary about Captain Ernest Shackleton and his crew

426
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,911
Surviving winter in the South Pole

427
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
He handed out Queen City strong bracelet

428
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
He still wears his everyday

429
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
And that was that

430
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Queen City

431
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
What is back

432
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,407
Queen City appliances has been out of bankruptcy

433
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
For two years now

434
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,991
And brightest companies doing really well

435
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
Profits are way up

436
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
You took me to the back of one of his stores

437
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
Into the warehouse

438
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
Second show me around some of the appliances

439
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,999
During the bankruptcy trustee told me it was almost empty

440
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,303
Now they're huge boxes

441
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,447
So dishwashers 5 high you know laundry products are for high

442
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,287
Row after row of appliances that just makes you feel good

443
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:49,407
He shows me one type of new refrigerator and I start to get the feeling he's trying to sell it to me

444
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,223
The gala Hideaway Shelton actually breaks away

445
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
Obi-Wan right there your wandering around

446
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,879
Why do you say I'm going tricker

447
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
I think what you want in there too

448
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
Amana freezers

449
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:05,279
Yeah this is this again become the most popular type

450
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
Refrigerator

451
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,911
Looking back on this though right he doesn't exactly to see bankruptcy

452
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
She is one of America's greatest

453
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Best inventions

454
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
He seems to see it as a

455
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Huge pain

456
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,103
His mom though who at first thought bankruptcy

457
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
She was not a thing that

458
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Good salad

459
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Has turned around

460
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
Actually kind of a fan of

461
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,063
I think it's a very

462
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,671
Very good way for a company to continue

463
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
So you

464
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
Your mind was changed

465
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
About bankruptcy

466
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Yes

467
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
I really want

468
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,423
It would have broken my heart if we close

469
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
And around town

470
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
Francis says

471
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,079
People were surprisingly accepting of the whole thing

472
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
They didn't see

473
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
It as a failure of them as a failure

474
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,735
Like that first Sunday morning after they filed

475
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
For bankruptcy

476
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,551
She was so nervous about

477
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Going

478
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,207
Going to church all of their friends everybody was very supportive see you went to church and it was okay it was okay

479
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,327
Same seat

480
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,399
Same seat for how many years

481
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,775
In the US we've decided we want in a

482
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
Economy where the CEO of Ana

483
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Appliance store

484
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Can dream big

485
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,895
Expand really fast

486
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,687
And if it doesn't work out

487
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,479
River system for dealing with the mess

488
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
So the business

489
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:33,599
Can keep going and a lot of companies out there today that are healthy now have

490
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
Been through this process

491
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,183
A couple of companies that I cover

492
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
General Motors

493
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Chrysler

494
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
United Airlines

495
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,303
Like almost every Airline

496
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,631
Marvel Comics the Texas Rangers ending

497
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
This is something

498
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Embedded

499
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
NRC

500
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,287
Is that other countries have started looking at RB

501
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
In part because of what happened during the last four

502
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Procession

503
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,663
Hundred thousands of

504
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Bankrupt in the US

505
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
And some of them made it out

506
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,831
An economist say this is one reason that our economy

507
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Bounce back

508
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
A bit faster than others

509
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
If the economy crashes

510
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
A company

511
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
As

512
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
A bad moment

513
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,559
It can you know eventually Shake It Off

514
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
It doesn't mean

515
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
The end

516
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,191
France Ireland Germany Spain Italy

517
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,239
They all modified their laws

518
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,287
Make them a little more like our chat

They decided

521
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871

Hi Ronnie how are you Stacy

539
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,567
How do you say see how are you I'm good how are you it's been five years since rowdy

540
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,871
And his mom Francis first went through their bankruptcy

541
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:37,759
Paparazzi this week and he told me that after a few tough years things have been looking up

542
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
I finished growing dramatically in

543
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
Aren't a lot of people Wednesday

544
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:47,743
Play I can't know for sure a bunch of big box stores

545
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
Have been closing down in this area

546
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,327
And that has been a whole lot of new customers

547
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:57,727
Righty opened a new Queen City in June and has another store he plans to open up before the end of the year

548
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,335
Does this growth feel different than the gross before the financial crash

549
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
It does

550
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,711
It really does she know more conservative

551
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,807
Stolen people don't bodies at this have to work nowadays it's more more more

552
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,135
And we certainly are.

553
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:21,792
Car wiring conscious of the resources that will come in a different parts of the business to make sure it's going to pay off for us

554
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:26,400
