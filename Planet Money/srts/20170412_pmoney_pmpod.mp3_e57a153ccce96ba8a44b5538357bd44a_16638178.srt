1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,816
Wherever you go in the world the Irish

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,352
Bar the Irish Pub

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,632
Looks pretty much the same

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,680
Dark wood smoking mirrors

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,448
And of course

6
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,496
Lots of old guys joking around

7
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,032
Any Irish in you

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
I'm half-irish

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,152
My mother's have shoes

10
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:24,064
This is my neighborhood Irish bar in Brooklyn

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
Will Ferrell

12
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,416
It's filled with retired police officers like Jack Scott

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,464
Andy's friend Randy Mancuso

14
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,280
Who works in the engine room of the Staten Island Ferry

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,328
I think women look in handshake

16
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,656
Old is 20 guys ain't going in that joint

17
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
We don't

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,312
Brown women coming here we don't

19
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
Is this a place to pick up girls for dating no it's not

20
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,856
Now the mystery of barrels to me is that it works at all

21
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
It doesn't

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,976
Why very hard to be genuinely Irish they serve bud and Bud Light in

23
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,768
Giant styrofoam cups

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,816
And I didn't see anyone at the time

25
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
Drinking Guinness anywhere

26
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,400
Is Irish because it was started by an Irish

27
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
A long time ago

28
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,544
I was here when I cut the ribbon in 33 all right choice open the place

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,568
Not true

30
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,104
Heels

31
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,688
Everybody knows everybody

32
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
Irish bars like this one spread around the world

33
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,368
And they feel pretty much the same because

34
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
Irish immigrants were copying this

35
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
Hazy memory

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,744
What pubs were like back in Ireland

37
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,536
Cute America the simply

38
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,096
Put their names on the front of it made the beer cheap

39
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
And called it a day

40
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,680
But one Irishman had a better idea

41
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
But if you can just

42
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,008
Figure out what made an Irish Pub work

43
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
Part we produce it and sell it

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
You can put an Irish pub in a container

45
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Stick a label on it

46
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
And ship it anywhere

47
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,808
Hello and welcome to Planet Money on Robert Smith

48
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:04,160
Play Michelle we're going to knock back a bunch of beer and we're going to ponder the Eternal question

49
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
Is this an awesome borrower

50
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,304
The story of the man who designed a thousand Irish Pub

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,496
We'd like to say a quick thank you and share a message from one of our sponsors

State Farm is much more than just an insurance

54
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,432

State Farm

Here to help life

62
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Go right

63
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,032
Before we meet The Mastermind of the Modern Irish Pub

64
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,336
We thought we should experience his work

65
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
First ham

66
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
Pub crawl

67
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Pub crawl

68
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
We already checked fails off the list next stop

69
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
What is the newest pubs in New York

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
A pub so exclusive

71
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
You have to submit to a full body scan

72
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
Close to it

73
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,536
This is a general boarding cost to order many passengers travel on Virgin Atlantic flight vs46

74
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,096
We should tell people where we are where are we

75
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
Where in

76
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
Terminal 4

77
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,936
JFK Airport

78
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
The most Irish place to be

79
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,800
I've never felt more at home

80
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,896
We invited along a genuine Irish person Siobhan Brett

81
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
She's also an economics reporter

82
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,736
Agreed to be our guide on this part of the crawl

83
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,344
Siobhan wants to see the tageen pub in JFK Airport because this right here

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,904
Is a little island of authenticity

85
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Any vast

86
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:47,072
Generic waist-length I believe this is the Irish band Maroon 5

87
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,912
Sitting behind us

88
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,496
Okay music aside so I said that the place is doing something

89
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
Much more subtle and smart

90
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,336
Slapping white an Irish name

91
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,872
Cleburne airport bar

92
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
Because it don't just look Irish

93
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,688
Everything in its place

94
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
From Ireland

95
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,064
From the dusty bottles on the shelves to the massive chairs

96
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,136
The furniture is also heavy duty in that steps

97
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
Tell tale sign I guess

98
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
Get these chairs weigh like a thousand pounds

99
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
Tables

100
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:22,143
Jabon recently wrote an article for eater.com that Trace back all of us

101
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
Stop

102
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,215
Two man named Mel McNally

103
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
And his business the Irish Pub company

104
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
AB Dublin

105
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,895
There's pop company finds people who want to start pubs around the world

106
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,967
An offer to sell them a whole package of Irish Magic

107
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
From the distressed vinyl floors

108
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
The pattern ceiling

109
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,879
Everything they sell has a story and everything is produced

110
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
In Ireland

111
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
And I'll send it to you in a giant shipping container

112
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,047
That's for selling point but if you want to really nail it

113
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
Come to us and

114
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
We're going to

115
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
Give you all of the components

116
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,495
That will give you an accurate and exact

117
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,567
Representation of what an Irish Pub is authenticity in a box

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,735
And they've been enormously successful Mel McNally has helped create

119
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
Thousands of Irish Pub

120
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
All the more unique but

121
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
There are very strict rules and things

122
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,183
Lakes you can order a Victorian style

123
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Wrath

124
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
Ornate stained glass

125
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,351
Or you can order a pub that rips off the Irish cottage style

126
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
That's a cozy place with old Nick nacks on the shelves

127
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
Makes you feel like you're relaxing in an Irish home

128
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
And not

129
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
Where you really are

130
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,103
Baseball tee to get a fire for boys

131
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
Next up on the pub crawl Dublin

132
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,735
Or Frost back to the radio Studio to call Dublin

133
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
To call

134
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Malik McDowell

135
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,831
How old were you when you first went into an Irish Pub

136
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
WW2

137
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,511
People bring their little Irish people live in Irish Pub

138
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,839
Nearly Christian the movie regression to be taken to vote later anyway

139
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
Male grew up in pubs but he

140
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,215
Really give him a serious thought until he was an architect

141
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
After school

142
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
It was a 1970

143
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
He and his fellow orchid

144
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,639
Come up with an idea for a final-year project

145
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,455
So what they decided to do is something

146
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,807
Before they decide we are going to write a paper on something

147
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
We already know a ton about

148
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Are we

149
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
The designs of Dublin Pub

150
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
As an analysis

151
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
How did you decide that

152
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
Over a few pints

153
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
We thought it'd be good crack

154
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
We thought we'd have a good time doing it

155
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,423
It was frowned upon initially

156
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,519
Why is it frowned upon to be not think of it as architecture

157
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,847
That was the word obviously by the tutors that this was a bit of a

158
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
Let's come together

159
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,735
Just have a good time

160
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:51,135
They took it really seriously they hit all the famous pubs in Dublin they brought along their sketch pads and their tape

161
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Measures

162
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
We were meticulous we

163
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,487
We looked at the craftsmanship

164
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
The artwork

165
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
A stained-glass work etc

166
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,607
We would say what makes this poem

167
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Different

168
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:06,495
They quickly discovered that the very best Irish pubs were obeying a set of unspoken rules

169
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
The first rule was

170
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:13,151
No matter where you are in the bar you should be able to see the alcohol you should have a view of the center

171
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Of the bar the second rule

172
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Is that the space

173
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
How to be divided up in a really shrewd way

174
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,343
Babies tiny little rooms called

175
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Schnucks

176
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
Time give me some privacy weather

177
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
Drink Mail system

178
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Cool things about how you divide

179
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,375
The space even the Long Bar would usually be broken up into segments

180
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
Separated by the screen

181
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,495
These screens we Golem or dividers

182
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,567
Hope people together in twos and fours and Eights

183
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:47,199
And they communicate and they get to meet each other while they're having more quiet intimate time

184
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
The rest of the crowd is sort of

185
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:53,855
Funneled into the center of the Irish bar Mingo and congregate

186
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,903
Can be noisy and have fun

187
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
Right in the center

188
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,791
Is is one of the focal points of a bar

189
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
First Student

190
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
You start to see that the

191
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,935
These things that we might not even notice in a bar or actually directing RB

192
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Behavior

193
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
They're creating exactly social

194
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,567
They're determining how my night at the pub

195
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
Will be

196
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Exactly

197
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,943
Obviously male in his fellow architecture students Ace their final project

198
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,271
But more than that Mel realize that he was now probably

199
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,599
The number one expert in traditional Irish Pub design

200
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
No idling already had enough

201
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,463
But I'm starting to think that the rest of the world did not

202
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Somail

203
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
Began to get on some planes wherever some eager entrepreneur wanted to open a traditional Irish Pub

204
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,447
And show them how it's done and done

205
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
In almost any country

206
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Try me

207
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Kazakhstan

208
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,943
I'm doing one in Kazakhstan at the moment

209
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
Give me another one

210
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Hong Kong

211
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Hong Kong Inn menu

212
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
The Ivory Coast

213
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
Interesting enough my son

214
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
Has nearly signed a contract for one there

215
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:07,071
Melton obit if you got the spaces and the details right there was no place to awkward or too remote

216
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:13,471
Milk came up with a really clever way to make sure that no one could just replicate his designs cheaply in a factory

217
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
3 in China

218
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,591
He convinced Pub owners around the world in order to build a truly authentic

219
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
In order to get the Irish Magic

220
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,455
You had to buy everything from iron

221
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
Where to buy everything from Mel McNally

222
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
The chairs

223
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
The lights the curtain

224
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
And in the interest of full Irish employment

225
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
He highly recommends in Irish

226
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Bartender

227
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
And a real Irishman to hell

228
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Help install everyday

229
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,303
Mel says I can run you $300,000

230
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,375
Maybe half a million dollars for typical Irish Pub although

231
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
He does say it goes up in

232
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
The Millions

233
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Tickly fancy run

234
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
Particularly difficult place

235
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
And he said if you really want to go see how it all comes together

236
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:53,407
He has a container of Irish stuff on its way straight from Dublin to a pub in

237
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Connecticut

238
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
So we went there to go check it out

239
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,039
This'll be the last stop of the pub crawl and that is where we meet

240
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Darren Fagan

241
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
Who works for Melmac

242
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
Now he handles all of his

243
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Us business

244
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
Darren Smith the morning checking the shipment for life

245
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
So there is an it's a full size crate

246
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
Weight of 40 foot container

247
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,863
So it went from Dublin to Liverpool Liverpool to New York

248
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,679
Any inside is everything Darren will need to

249
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
We do

250
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
Is pop now I should say this is already working

251
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Irish Pub

252
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,847
Part of the chain called Seguin metal originally designed it

253
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
20 years ago

254
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
But the owners wanted to be up to

255
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
The basic layout of the pub will remain the same

256
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,087
It already perfectly conforms to the male McNally rule about

257
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Segmented spaces

258
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,903
Every Patron in the pub.

259
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
82 bar no matter where the person is sitting

260
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,767
And it's still really easy to pair off into

261
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Smaller

262
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Books and snug

263
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
But other than that the entire inside is going to get nude

264
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Decorations

265
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Furniture

266
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
And there's another male McNally real for that too

267
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
It's very haphazard he uses the word higgledy piggledy

268
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,847
Notice bottles

269
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,919
Here in like there's some weird plate up over there

270
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
And the photos are sort of

271
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
Haphazardly arranged

272
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,551
But you're not so there's a deliberate in it

273
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,951
Recommence a reflection of Irish families wear over generations and generations they all live in the same house but the true nothing away

274
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Celebrity went to the Shelf

275
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
The thing they're going for is Irish Porter

276
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Gun shows us

277
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
His plans

278
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
And all the stuff they're going to update and swap out

279
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,519
It gave me a better appreciation for what the company is trying to do

280
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,591
This isn't just a prefabricated Pub the

281
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Did you put together with

282
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Allen wrench

283
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
Live forever

284
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,759
People's conception of what looks authentically old-timey

285
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
It changes all the

286
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,135
So they are going to swap out some of the old crap

287
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,463
Forbes some more up-to-date old crap

288
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:48,863
Princess some of the frame magazine ads for eggs and butter they're going to replace those as with framed black

289
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Black and white photos of

290
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Famous Dubliners

291
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:55,007
Girl sucking swap out some of the furniture Karen says when they first designed the pub

292
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
The tables and the chairs were too tiny

293
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,871
Realize people are bigger and it needs more space

294
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,199
I'm not overdoing so American

295
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
I can say that we happy few unarmed to

296
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,647
In the pub is this you have to keep changing the definition of

297
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
What exact

298
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Is genuine

299
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,487
It has to feel like Dublin

300
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,559
But now also promises to provide a unique design

301
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Design Taylor

302
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
To a particular location to

303
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Particular customers

304
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,959
The particular size of your customers butts

305
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,543
But ultimately the question is is all of this

306
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Really Irish

307
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Differences

308
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Yes absolutely

309
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,943
But at the same time he also acknowledges

310
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
They're telling a story

311
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
A lot of what we did

312
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,599
Over the years was spinning at a light at the archway

313
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
If I said that was done because

314
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,255
You know Joe's open yada yada and it came from a place in mayo land

315
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
Cuz why would you not trust an Irishman

316
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,239
So what at the same point to come for a disco ball in and then try and spend that one because nobody believed you

317
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,335
So you kind of have to to retain your own credibility

318
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,895
Going to have to be careful with how you spend on tail

319
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,991
Do you think you are in a level of dress right when you open your mouth and people here acting

320
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
There's no question about it

321
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
It's a definite

322
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
The more authentic there irishness

323
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
What's the more successful they are

324
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,743
But the more successful they are the harder it is to

325
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
To pull off

326
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
The authentic

327
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,863
Because the demand for all of this stuff

328
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
The higgly-piggly jump

329
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,191
It's contributing to aderans houses

330
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,471
Is a global

331
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Shortage

332
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
A real authentic Irish kit

333
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
It's a crisis

334
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,151
The island has been ransacked

335
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Jugs and

336
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Old butter dishes

337
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,783
To create atmospheres around the world in all these different Irish Pub

338
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
And we played a part of not right so I can't be overly critical Auto

339
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,535
But now I kind of CD sad sites what because we're looking at reproductions were having a heart of time

340
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,863
Finding original bric-a-brac because it's just not there anymore

341
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,679
And there's poke company has competition for that breaker

342
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,751
They're few hours companies that started up to do the same thing

343
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
A little Irish

344
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Procure

345
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,847
There an old leather chair in the corner

346
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
And your business

347
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
I guess I just don't buy that all this

348
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,575
Deliberate Irish magical need some help filters down into the customers

349
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Consciousness

350
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
You can do it as a little

351
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,487
Tribal way I thought was everyone can't go to

352
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,535
A pub in Dublin it's been around for

353
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,607
Sort the Cayman go to Farrell's in my neighborhood

354
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
But sometimes you just want to drink

355
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
In an airport

356
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
Or on A Street near the

357
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
And you want to space that makes you feel

358
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,615
Feel a certain way like you're drinking with friends even if

359
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,711
There are no friends around and have figured out a sort of

360
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
Social short

361
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,063
And I think the subliminal signals of

362
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
The dusting knick knacks

363
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,903
Any Irish cheers I think that adds to the

364
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
Wait

365
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
What about that butter dish on the wall

366
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
At tageen in Stamford

367
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Yeah the butter dish

368
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,559
So

369
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
