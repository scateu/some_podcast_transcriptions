1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,792
There are two kinds of

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,816
People in this world

3
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:06,144
People who think about germs people who do not

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,936
Lisa resin movich

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,704
Her life

6
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:13,056
I am the director of infection prevention here at Hunterdon health

7
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:17,664
Think of Lisa at the hand-washing police at this County Hospital in New Jersey

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,712
I have been called worse but yes

9
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,736
Yes that is a nickname

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040
Well

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,344
We don't go into it but

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,928
Lisa is a germ investigator

13
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,952
So

14
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:35,072
I'm potentially exposed to a lot of on different types of bacteria viruses

15
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,352
Different pathogens that make people say

16
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,168
Lisa's job is to prevent germs from

17
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
Spreading

18
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,544
If anybody at this hospital has a bad bug they have to alert Lisa

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,408
Anytime there's a positive lab they automatically fax over the results

20
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,688
What is an incident report

21
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,992
Nothing good comes from the fact

22
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
Machine

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,552
And one morning last spring

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,088
It comes to life

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,136
Spits out a sheet of paper

26
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,672
She walks over

27
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,744
Picks up the paper turns it over and she sees

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,280
E-coli

29
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
O15

30
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
7 H7

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
This is the worst

32
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,704
Combination of numbers in letters

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
Is this kind of E coli

34
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
Is the really bad

35
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,848
They release something called the sugar tax

36
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,920
You can shut down your kidneys that can kill you

37
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,944
And Lisa

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,040
Bed bug investigator her job is to run straight toward the danger

39
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
Straight

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,648
To a 66 year old grandma Louise

41
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
Frasier

42
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,208
Normally pretty feisty

43
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,792
Mine or Miss is to either walk 6 miles or I run

44
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
3 miles

45
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,096
So very energetic

46
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,168
Yeah but today everyone in the hospital is

47
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,240
Poking and probing her they are not going to let her kidney

48
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Blood test

49
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
Everyday

50
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
I think they suck me like

51
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
20 times in the one arm

52
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,456
Doctors are forcing liquids into her kidneys

53
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,504
To keep them from shedding down

54
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,528
She's weak

55
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,832
Bloated from all the fluids and

56
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
She just wants to lay there

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
With her eyes closed

58
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
Louise doesn't remember a lot about this

59
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,976
It's all a blur

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
But she remembers

61
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
Some woman coming

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
Sitting down next to her

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
This was Lisa

64
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,984
Of course she said I'm going to sit with you for like an hour we need to go through and talk about everything

65
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
You ate in the last week to 10 days

66
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,592
This is where Lisa's detective work

67
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Start

68
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,736
Lisa needed to know everything that Louise ate every sauce every night every fruit

69
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,808
Because if you're sick with e-coli

70
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,856
You probably pick it up from something you ate

71
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
And Lisa

72
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,464
She needed a list of potential culprits

73
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
So she pulls out a calendar to help Louise remember

74
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
And we just went back

75
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,840
Date by date

76
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
And then as she told me what she ate

77
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
You then have to ask

78
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
What was in it

79
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
What was on the pizza

80
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
Where do you buy the food from

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
What ShopRite what Costco what

82
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
Supermarket

83
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,992
What supermarket can think about what you had for lunch

84
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Last Wednesday

85
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
I was

86
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
Working at home

87
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
I got something out of the fridge

88
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,488
I don't remember what what did you have for dinner let's see last Thursday

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
I can pretty much guarantee I had cheese

90
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Cuz I eat a lot of cheese

91
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,168
But I don't know where I got it from us we breakfast I know Brett

92
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,984
Okay the point is this stuff is

93
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,544
Really difficult I honestly have

94
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
No idea how Louise

95
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
Remember every single thing that she

96
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,736
At least that she's right there with her going through the calendar Mondays breath

97
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
What about lunch

98
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
Jenny snacks

99
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
And Louise is like no no Lisa

100
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
I can save you the trouble I know what the problem

101
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,232
I had this huge meal the day before I started feeling

102
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
It was a fish fry for the local fire

103
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
I was eating fried clams

104
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:53,472
Pierogies I was eating french fries and then I topped it off by going to our local ice cream store and having ice cream

105
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
I'm thinking that's what made me sick

106
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
It was not the fish

107
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,872
The fire department did not accidentally poison Louis

108
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,712
Do not blame the firefighters but something did Poison

109
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,528
And it poisoned a bunch of other people too

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,856
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

111
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
I'm Sarah Gonzales

112
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,488
Louise is not the only one who's sick

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,583
At the same time all across the country hundreds of people are getting

114
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,191
And there's an army of investigators trying to figure out

115
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Why

116
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,519
Today on the show we join the investigation

117
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,383
Go on the trail of a nasty micro all the way to a valley in the desert

118
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
Heads will

119
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
Roll

131
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,847
There is a step by step method to solving a true food

132
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
And the very first piece of the puzzle is

133
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
Which

134
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Food

135
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:13,087
This is why Lisa resume average SAT there with Louise Frazier in your hospital room

136
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
Going through those food memory

137
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,975
Deliciously shameful food memories

138
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
Monday I took my

139
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
Grandson to

140
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
The show

141
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
Great meal that day I had ice

142
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
I had a hot dog

143
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,775
Ice cream on my way home that was my that was my meals those days

144
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
We talked about bad habits

145
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:38,175
My kind of girl there were some healthy things to though a meal at a Panera restaurant

146
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,967
A Fuji apple chicken salad

147
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
My favorite there

148
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,319
And Lisa our infection fighter

149
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,623
She's back in your office typing

150
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
Fuji apple chicken salad into this

151
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
National early warning system

152
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,815
If microbes are launching a sneak attack

153
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,631
This is how the whole country finds out about it

154
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,447
So she's right there typing all this information in

155
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
And then the fax machine

156
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
Comes to life again

157
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
Another case of E coli

158
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
In her Hospital

159
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,687
Music does the same thing runs to the patient

160
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,991
Calendar survey and

161
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Whoa

162
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
This patient

163
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,623
Also ate a salad at

164
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Panera

165
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
At least a thing

166
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
I got to let the big bosses at the County Health Department know about this

167
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,535
So she calls Kathy jig

168
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
Whose job is to

169
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Stay calm

170
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
So she called me that

171
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,727
There's something suspicious going on I have two cases of e-coli

172
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
At the same time

173
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
And Kathy's thinking Pinterest

174
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
I'll keep an eye on that

175
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
And then she gets another call

176
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
This time from the state

177
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
And they tell her to more people

178
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,783
In the next County over have also just tested positive for e-coli

179
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,111
I was shocked surprised and my adrenaline was flowing

180
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,415
And now Kathy has to find out what the

181
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,183
They hate

182
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,767
Because if they ate at a Panera that's more than a coincidence

183
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
That's a pattern

184
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
So she calls and she gets through to one of the page

185
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
Your husband was at the bedside

186
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
And the

187
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,007
Wife would answer the questions through him and he wouldn't answer my

188
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,079
They go through all her meals and

189
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Yep

190
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
This patient also ate a salad from Panera

191
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
But we all ate at

192
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
Different Panera

193
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
And this is important because

194
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
It was the same restaurant

195
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
Chances are

196
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,183
The problem is at the restaurant maybe someone wasn't watching their hands right

197
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,791
But the fact that people are getting sick from food at different Panera's means this is bigger

198
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
This

199
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
Goes up the food chain

200
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
All these sick people

201
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Had different

202
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Salads

203
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
So investigators start looking at

204
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,311
The ingredients in the salad is it the tomatoes is it

205
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,151
The carrots is it the hearts of palm they all had one thing in

206
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:46,943
Lettuce

207
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Well

208
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Sure cuz

209
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
It's a salad

210
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
But specifically

211
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,063
It was romaine lettuce

212
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,903
But then people all over the country start getting

213
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
Sick dozens are hospitalized

214
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,279
People who never ate at a Panera

215
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,375
One guy pick up a Caesar salad at a Costco in Idaho

216
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
So at this point it becomes

217
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
Clear

218
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Panera is not

219
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
The problem

220
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
It's

221
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
The Romaine

222
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
5 people died

223
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
And now

224
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
The feds are involved

225
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
The nation's top

226
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
Cop on the food infection beat

227
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
He is on the

228
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Every moment

229
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
Is of the essence

230
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
This is Steve ostrow from the Food and Drug Administration

231
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,719
Before he was in the FDA he was an assistant Surgeon General

232
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:36,863
A rear Admiral people saluted him and he's like okay so we know it's the Romaine but which

233
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
Romaine from what farm exactly

234
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
Who is growing this

235
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,751
Contaminated lettuce

236
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,335
The more we can narrow in on this thing the better if we can find the

237
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
The store that selling it

238
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
The farm

239
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Came from

240
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
The exact field we can shut it

241
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
Down order a recall

242
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Save

243
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,343
Deep senses investigators to restaurants

244
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
Some grocery stores where sick people bought their lettuce

245
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,439
We say showers for records

246
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
Azteca

247
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
That romaine lettuce that you were

248
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Serving

249
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,887
Or that you had sitting on the grocery store shelf on that day

250
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
And it is so hard to

251
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,007
To track a leaf of lettuce back to where it came from

252
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
Restaurants are telling Steve little army

253
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,663
We got this remain from a bunch of different processors and processors are like

254
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,735
We got it from a bunch of different farms and chopped it all up

255
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Together

256
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
The investigators are getting

257
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
Nowhere

258
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
Naked berry

259
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,207
Prostrating the only thing they know is the most basic fact of lettuce geogra

260
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,535
Pretty much all the lettuce in the US comes from just to place

261
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,863
Sisters Yuma Arizona and the Salinas Valley in California

262
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
They sort of take turns

263
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
Yuma grows in the fall and winter

264
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
The Salinas Valley takes over in the

265
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
Spring and summer

266
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
Given the timing this contaminated lettuce mustard

267
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Just come from Yuma

268
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:56,479
So the government pulls out their biggest bluntest will they tell the whole country

269
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,295
Any romaine lettuce from Yuma

270
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Could

271
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Kill you

272
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
And I remember this

273
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
Very distinct

274
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
I was texting my mom and my sister is like

275
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,607
Nobody by Romaine it is killing people that you were actually part of a big problem

276
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,983
Did the country the government was saying don't buy Romaine from Yuma Arizona

277
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
And what everybody heard was

278
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,567
Is just don't buy Romaine

279
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Yeah that's what I heard

280
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,151
Even Lisa the infection fighter who got the

281
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
This whole thing rolling

282
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,759
She had two menacing heads of romaine lettuce in

283
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,319
I'm looking at them and I thought well

284
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
How do I know if the this is packaged in

285
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:40,255
Do you Marie I didn't go to Arizona and buy it from there I bought it from a supermarket around here

286
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
And at that time I had

287
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
Been in the supermarket

288
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
And they were too

289
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,631
If directed

290
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
Any romaine lettuce

291
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
To pull off the shelf

292
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,287
So everyone is just dumping all their Romaine in the trash

293
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
But here is the weird thing about

294
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
About this by the time people reacted to that warning most of the lettuce wasn't even coming from Arizona anymore it was coming

295
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
From California

296
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,063
So it was farmers in California took the hit

297
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
Nobody wanted to buy their romaine lettuce either

298
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
So California Farmers

299
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Have no other choice

300
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
They had

301
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,327
To destroy their beautiful healthy Romaine

302
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Ran over it

303
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
With these big machines that chopped up all these heads of lettuce and plowed them into the dirt they

304
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
They had to bury

305
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,103
Perfectly healthy lettuce

306
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,455
And then the sounds so sad to me

307
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Dan

308
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
It's so hard to be a farmer

309
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,087
It is not just Public Health officials who are looking into this

310
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
There's a guy in Seattle

311
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
A lawyer he's watching this very careful

312
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,231
Kentucky's got his own investigation

313
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,791
His name is Bill Marler

314
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,911
You know I have a morbid curiosity to these things cuz I've been doing this for so long

315
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,751
If you get sick from food and you want the food companies to pay

316
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,335
Bill is the guy you call he sues food companies for a living

317
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
And he's serious

318
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,687
The last time salad was making a lot of people sick

319
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,039
Bill Marler got on a plane to California looking for info on how it

320
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,183
I camped out in Salinas and San Juan Bautista for a week

321
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
Hanging out in bars

322
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
Trying to find

323
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
Where the investigators were

324
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:24,959
Bill is now representing Louise Louise who is having fluids pumped into her kidneys

325
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,263
He's also representing about a hundred other

326
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
People who got sick during this

327
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Romaine E coli outbreak

328
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,687
He's obsessively following every new Story related to this

329
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
Staying and

330
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,039
He comes across one that seems like a really big

331
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Break

332
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
It came

333
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
From a prison

334
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
That's right a Prison Break

335
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,487
8 men in a prison in Nome Alaska of all place

336
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Asus got sick from E coli

337
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
And because they were locked up investigators Newegg

338
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
Exactly what they did

339
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,167
But it wasn't chopped up salad mix

340
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
This time it was

341
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
Whole heads of lettuce

342
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
And the prison had invoices

343
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
Showing exactly where it

344
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,383
Paris Farm Show

345
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
It was a it was a pretty good

346
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:12,319
Little piece of evidence he thinks this is it we've got the corporate this one farm and

347
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,647
Everybody wants the contamination to lead back to just one

348
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Farm

349
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,719
This is the best case scenario

350
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,023
For consumers for the FDA

351
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
Even for the farmers

352
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
Except for the farmer whose name is on the invoice

353
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,983
Ultimately there can be one person to blame and therefore you're blameless

354
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
You at least can avoid

355
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,871
You know direct responsibility

356
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
But here's the problem

357
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
Louise did not eat lettuce

358
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,503
That's grown on the same Farm as the prisoners

359
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,575
There wasn't one trail of contaminated lettuce

360
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
There were a lot

361
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Trail

362
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,951
Leading to a bunch of different farms in Yuma

363
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
Miles apart

364
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
To something else happened in these

365
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Fields

366
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
Something

367
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Mysterious

368
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:04,031
After the break

369
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:10,431
We catch a flight to Yuma Arizona we are on the hunt for e-coli

370
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,247

00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
What's in your wallet

379
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
Capital One

380
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Na

381
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
All winter long

382
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,727
America's salad comes from a narrow Valley

383
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,799
5 miles wide and 50 Meandering miles long

384
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
It follows the Colorado River

385
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,639
When I was there it was Blazing

386
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Oppressive

387
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,759
When the weather turns cooler this place is perfect for growing crops

388
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,879
Most of the farmers in Yuma did not really want to talk to me about ecola it is not a pleasant

389
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Syntopicon

390
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,719
One farmer though he said come on over

391
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
Steve Alameda

392
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Big lettuce grower

393
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
Co-owner of Top flavor Farms

394
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
I found it

395
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,935
How are you I'm good how are you

396
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,847
Places amazing he was bald got a plaid shirt and mudding issues he's super friendly and super proud of what he does

397
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
I say can you show me around

398
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Usher

399
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,527
He chose me cotton field Hayfield some date

400
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,111
Trees and Acres of bare dirt that will turn into lettuce fields

401
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,207
7 another five months is a wallaby green I'll be green with veggie

402
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,791
You can grow anything here well it's

403
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
For a grower

404
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
Would what would I put the

405
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,215
We just be like being in the Silicon Valley I equated to that

406
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
I tell Steve that I am on the trail of E coli

407
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,359
And he's like yeah you and the whole FDA

408
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
He says there's a team of them

409
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
Poking around this Valley

410
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Testing the water that

411
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Farmers used

412
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
To water their crops

413
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,343
And Steve son Mike

414
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:58,463
She knows exactly where they are like right now

415
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
And he pulls up a map

416
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,303
So I'll drop a pin right here on that road

417
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
And and where's the canal

418
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Right below it

419
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,215
If the E coli is out there I am going to find

420
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
Have a good day thank you you too

421
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
IHOP in my rental car

422
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
I head east

423
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,383
It takes a while but eventually I find

424
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,943
There's a van and a white Suburban

425
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
9 people are standing along a

426
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Concrete lines

427
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Ditch with water running long.

428
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
Most of them look like grads

429
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,671
Summer wearing blue latex gloves

430
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
They have cooler

431
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Hi-Tech scientific

432
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,559
Every so often one of them reaches down and fills a bucket

433
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
With water

434
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,399
A broad-shouldered guy comes over to say hello

435
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,959
He's an FDA employee based in Yuma

436
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,031
He says they can't tell me much about what they're doing out here

437
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Very sensitive

438
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:50,687
And a few hundred feet away there's another Canal filled with water this is a bigger one

439
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,527
A bunch of farmers use that water on their lettuce

440
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087
And right next to this water

441
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
Cow

442
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,671
As far as the eye can see

443
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
Thousands of them

444
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Just standing there quiet

445
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Quietly

446
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,863
They won make any noise he wouldn't move for you know they're standing there on this

447
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,679
Bearger lined up alongside

448
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,727
Troughs filled with corn and hay

449
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Eating

450
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Not moving

451
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Pooping

452
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
Cattle

453
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:23,967
The animals that most often carry E coli o157

454
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,783
This is where E coli comes from

455
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,599
Humans sometimes but it's usually

456
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
Animals

457
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Deer

458
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
Wild pigs

459
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Cow

460
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,511
This might be where the long search

461
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
For the source of the contamination

462
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
This might be where that search ends

463
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
Actually here goes a truck

464
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,751
Caring cattle manure out into the fields where it's composted

465
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
Driving right past this ditch

466
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,663
The FDA found e-coli

467
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,687
Invest

468
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,527
Water canal be exact genetic strain that got everyone sick

469
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,599
Their theory is that e-coli from the

470
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Cow manure

471
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,695
Washed into this irrigation ditch or

472
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Blue in

473
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,791
And then the contaminated water to

474
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
Flowed into

475
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
All the vegetable fields

476
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Across

477
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
The valley

478
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
I talked to Steve about this day

479
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,287
He doesn't get his water from it but his lettuce farming friends

480
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,871
And they've actually been worried about these cows for a long time

481
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
Cuz they're just so close to the vegetables

482
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
You got like I say 100000 animals that the real culprit space

483
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,903
So you know what you be

484
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,975
You before not to not to have that pop in your head

485
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,327
Anyway I can say we're aware of it

486
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
And we were always

487
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
Checking for it looking in

488
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
Hoping that we can

489
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,263
Survive you know next to each other but which we've done four

490
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
60 years

491
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
And in

492
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,943
So did something change something happened that we that we

493
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
We need to know I need to know

494
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,367
The lettuce growing season in Yuma is supposed to start up again in just a couple of months

495
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,439
And Steven is friends want to grow lettuce again

496
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,487
But those cattle are still there

497
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
And the farmers

498
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,791
Don't know what to

499
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,863
To do the FDA hasn't announced any rules or

500
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
Even recommendations for what

501
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:22,239
The farmer should do differently and the thing that really scares the farmers

502
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,567
Is the possibility that the people who buy their lettuce

503
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
The big supermarket

504
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
Get some processors

505
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,455
Maybe they will say we don't trust lettuce from Yuma any

506
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
We won't buy it

507
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,575
Bill Marler the food safety lawyer says they should be worried

508
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,391
If there's another outbreak like this

509
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,743
A tough question for a Walmart or tough question for Costco is

510
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
Flydubai

511
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
You know product

512
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,143
From a place that you know is near

513
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447
A feedlot that just had an outbreak last

514
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,799
That's a that's a very uncomfortable question

515
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
That a lawyer gets to ask

516
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:03,711
Steve and his fellow lettuce farmers are trying to figure this out one way they're talking about

517
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
Is to treat

518
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
Irrigation canal with chlorine

519
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
To kill any e-coli

520
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,647
But they've also been talking about something more drastic

521
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,231
Maybe those cows are now just too much of a

522
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
Threat to the lettuce and

523
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,815
Maybe the lettuce Farmers have to

524
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
The band together and buy the Feedly

525
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Just to kick the cows out

526
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Shut it down

527
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
4 century

528
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
Farmers of raised

529
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Their animals

530
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
And their vegetables

531
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Side by side

532
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
But farming has reached

533
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,407
Such a scale now

534
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,199
Maybe they can't annies

535
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,503
Maybe this Valley

536
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
Just ain't big enough for the both of them

537
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
Poor cows

538
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:48,255
You can send a story idea Planet Money at npr.org

539
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,863
We're also on Facebook Twitter and Instagram I'll put up some pictures from the trip

540
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,727
Today's show was produced by Elisa is garce and Alexi Horowitz.
