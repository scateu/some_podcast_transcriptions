1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,792
Beer Yuengling

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:05,120
When two people really love each other

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:08,704
Just tell him that we're going to talk about Xmas episode

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,472
Not your one

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:15,360
A couple years ago even woke up in Denmark

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
2 news of a

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
Weird problem

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
There was some

9
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,224
Smallville articles in

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,296
A very serious newspapers that

11
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,368
Told the story about the problem

12
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
With

13
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Not

14
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:33,536
But having enough children born in Denmark Great Danes for not having enough babies

15
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,840
Is to replace the existing population

16
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,376
And this matter to Eva

17
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,656
Because she works at a travel a

18
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,704
And she thinks oh

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,496
We're not going to have enough customers in a few

20
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:48,384
So they're like okay we need to figure out who our customers are now where are they going what do they do how do we get them to

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Keep traveling

22
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,712
And what we found out with that

23
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,576
People going on city breaks will mainly couples City breaks you mean vacation

24
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,880
Yeah sort of like small vacation

25
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
Two or three nights

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,768
It's to a big city of people in Denmark get 5 weeks of vacation every year

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,304
Hangouts

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,376
So apparently when Danish couples going these

29
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Shorts

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
City breaks

31
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:11,936
They aren't

32
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Going out

33
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
See the sights of Rome and Paris they're just

34
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Unwinding

35
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,848
Staying in their hotel rooms

36
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
And that's why I

37
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
We did

38
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,712
The kind of the assumption that it going

39
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
Abroad

40
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
Might

41
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
Turn into more sex

42
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
And more sex

43
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,136
Have the ability to turn into children

44
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
Right that is how you make more children

45
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
Exactly

46
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,280
Eva realizes there might be an opportunity

47
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,864
To create future customers and sure to help out.

48
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,912
So she watches an ad can

49
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
The app that we came up with

50
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,496
Will do it for Denmark

51
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,592
Do it for Denmark like do it do it it is

52
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
DC, Wisconsin

53
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
There ads

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,064
Basically say

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,648
It is your civic duty for the sake of your country

56
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
Do it and

57
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
Use our planes

58
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
Do it in a different country

59
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
Okay so these these ads

60
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
They are not

61
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
Settle a

62
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
Like beer very

63
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
Suggestive yes it is it is

64
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
These eyes are like

65
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
Emma

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,200
She was born and raised in Denmark but she was made by her parents

67
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
In this hotel room in Paris

68
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
So it's quite obvious

69
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
It's what we are

70
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
What we are

71
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
Suggesting should happen on that

72
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:39,488
On that City breaks travel agency even ran contests that were like hey

73
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,840
Prove you gave birth to a baby around 9 months after your vacation

74
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,680
And we will give you three years worth of baby supplies and

75
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
A child friendly vacation

76
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
And if you were ovulating

77
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
They gave you a discount

78
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
Based on the input from

79
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Peoples

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,432
Period cycle

81
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
We found the

82
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
The Puritans that they were

83
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
Ovulating and then

84
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,344
We suggested different

85
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
City trips

86
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
Especially that.

87
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Wait so

88
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
Women were going to

89
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Your travel agency

90
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,584
And telling you when they're next.

91
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
They did

92
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,192
So that they could get a. Discount

93
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Exactly

94
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,848
This is like probably the only time in the world that women get rewarded

95
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
For having their period

96
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Yeah I think we should do that

97
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
More right

98
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,296
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm

99
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,368
Kenny Malone and I'm Sarah Gonzales today on the show

100
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
Do it

101
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
For your country

102
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
People aren't

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,488
Just good for the economy bar the economy

104
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
And when a police needs people

105
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:50,400
I'll try anything we have a story of a plan to resurrect in Italian

106
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
Ghost Town a battle to save

107
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
US Congress seats

108
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,592
By buying some residents and a state that's looking for some young blood

109
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
Support also comes from the UPS Store

110
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,320
From printing packing and copying

111
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
Do faxing mailboxing and notarizing

112
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,928
The UPS Store offers everything

113
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
Personal

114
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
And this Memorial Day week

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
May 24th and 25th

116
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
When others may be closing

117
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
The UPS Store

118
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
He's doing another thing

119
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
All together

120
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Opening

121
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,191
Because small business owners

122
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
Can't afford to take days off

123
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
The UPS Store

124
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Every Inc

125
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
For small business

126
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
And of course shipping

127
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
I'm Linda home

128
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,223
There's more stuff to watch these days than you can ever get to

129
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
That's why we make popcorn

130
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Alter happy hour

131
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,111
Twice a week we give you the lowdown on what's worth your time and what's new

132
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
Fun pop culture happy hour on

133
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
On the NPR one app or wherever you get

134
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
Scissor I feel like I should admit that when I

135
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
Her the places were paying

136
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
Population of death

137
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
I thought that they would

138
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,727
Pathetic little places like it seems like kids having to pay for their own friends

139
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
Lunch cafeteria

140
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,639
But I feel like this next example sort of puts that the rest I actually think this is like one of the best ways

141
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Laura people

142
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,247
Sarah and I called up a guy named Nate Wilde

143
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,343
One of the people in charge of promoting this particular pay for popular

144
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Hello

145
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
Podcast

146
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
I just want to say

147
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
I just

148
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
Visited me a visit Maine recently also actual

149
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,351
You have amazing National Park

150
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,399
Awesome Lobster Like Houses

151
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
You've got like wild blueberries Galore

152
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,311
And you're telling us that like you have to pay people to come and live there

153
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:39,967
Well that's one of the few things were trying

154
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
Vacation destination

155
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,807
Steven Wright vacationland on their license

156
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
However

157
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
Vacationland

158
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
Is not the same as population

159
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
Man gets about 36 million visitors a year

160
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
They have a population of just 1 million people

161
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
And

162
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
Those 1 million people

163
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,911
So our population is old and white

164
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,775
Generally speaking Maine has the oldest population in the country

165
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
The median age is just shy of

166
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
44 years

167
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:11,455
And what that means is that main needs people to come and take care of its agent

168
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Population

169
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,039
He says there's a huge need for everything from

170
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
Positions to administrators to ITP

171
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
People who can work at the hospital

172
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,487
And so about 10 years ago Maine decided to basically payoff

173
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
People student loans

174
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
Mangel students in the state

175
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
If you stay

176
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
And go to college in Maine

177
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
And then stick around after

178
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,727
Do you graduate we're going to give you a

179
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Huge break on your state income

180
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Thumbtacks

181
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,311
Two off

182
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,591
Set your student loan

183
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
So if you pay for example $2,000

184
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,431
Student loans

185
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,503
You got $2,000 knocked off your state income

186
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,831
And if you're from a stem field science technology

187
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Math

188
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
They're even more generous

189
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:58,047
An employer Community spoke up loud and clear and said that's great but even if we retain 100% of every

190
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
College graduate in Maine

191
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
That doesn't solve our talent

192
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
That means you are

193
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Are quite low on Young

194
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
Yes

195
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,543
Swain said okay let's broaden the program

196
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Now

197
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,663
We don't care which state you're from and you can go to college anywhere in the country

198
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,735
As long as you come to Maine afterwards

199
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
And work here

200
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
Will cut you the same deal

201
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,623
The state will help with your student loan payments by dropping your state

202
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Although

203
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
As Sarah and I learned

204
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
There are some restriction

205
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,559
So I graduated from college in California

206
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
So I can move to Maine

207
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,167
And you would offset my student loans

208
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
If I moved

209
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:42,847
If you graduated in your 2016 2017 2018 or any urine to the Future

210
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Went like actual

211
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:48,991
Enter House burn

212
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,367
And we don't feel old but like you're not too old to live and work in Maine you definitely qualify for the quality of life we have to

213
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
How about that

214
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,719
What is not a cop come on man

215
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
The quality of

216
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Where else in the world

217
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
Can you wake up in the morning walk on the beach

218
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,631
Before you go to work go for a hike at your lunch break

219
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
And Beyond the ski slopes

220
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
By 3 p.m.

221
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
California

222
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
Ultra mod

223
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:18,175
That's baloney the traffic in California you'd barely get to the beach by noon if you left before you woke up

224
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,759
Find whatever is Maine doesn't want 30-somethings like us there I don't want to be in Maine anyway

225
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
Please lighthouses

226
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:30,207
Batteries don't need a cell main has effectively paid off

227
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,535
More than 50 million dollars worth of student loans

228
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Through the storm

229
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,143
And it says it's hard to know which of these graduates came to Maine.

230
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
Because of the program but

231
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
As of last year around 9

232
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Thousand

233
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
Actually young people

234
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
We're working in Maine

235
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
Taking advantage of this

236
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,151
What young people mean is Decades of

237
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
Work often times there's going to start a family they're going to

238
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,575
Contribute a few more human beings to minsk population

239
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
Pretty smart they don't have a cap on how many people can

240
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,487
Participate in this program but you only get your student loans

241
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Offset

242
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
If you can find a

243
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Job in Maine

244
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,399
And that's like this naturally built-in restriction

245
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
And they said that is good

246
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,519
Because honestly the state couldn't handle it

247
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Massive

248
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Influx of new

249
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
Switch on the housing authority on the school

250
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
We have two jobs

251
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,991
So we're not looking for a huge number of people were looking for the right people

252
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
And more of them

253
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
To choose

254
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
I like hearing man

255
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Justina

256
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
Not old

257
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,135
30 year old

258
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,487
Although we do have so much more World experience

259
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Down the street

260
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
We wouldn't wear

261
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
Twitter Twitter annoying thanks

262
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399
We don't even know still doing the

263
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,471
The Vaping

264
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
We sending it for me you can go today

265
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:57,503
Nick you went with dates

266
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,063
That is so debasing an existential crisis

267
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Rhode Island

268
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
I went there to meet

269
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Carlos tobon

270
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,791
We ended up driving around in his truck maybe we could take a little ride and I'll show you some of the cool things

271
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:16,191
That we have Carlos is the number one booster of Rhode Island State Rep

272
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:22,591
He represents about 15,000 people and it seems like he knows every single one of them he points them out while

273
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,991
We drive by their houses this guy used to have a business this guy he's as he works at a lumber yard

274
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:35,391
The Puerto Rican Family clearly been knocking doors in this neighborhood

275
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,791
Absolutely it took a lot of campaigning for Carlos to get elected the first time

276
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:48,191
Read three times before I got elected I lost three times and in 2012 I made history just

277
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:54,591
Not the one that I want it I lost by one vote for me when people

278
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,991
We'll talk about counting I take it so seriously Sarah Carlos is a man obsess

279
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Assessed with

280
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,575
Okay his obsession goes back decades

281
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,647
When he was a teenager he had the job of a numeral

282
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
Numerator

283
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,487
Yeah I learned that's just a fancy way of saying

284
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
Count to the people of Rhode Island

285
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
For the US Census

286
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
So I can or knock on the door

287
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,959
And say hello my name is Carlos I'm with the Census Bureau and

288
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
We see that

289
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
We haven't received your paperwork

290
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,103
Crows want to make sure that everyone in the state

291
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
It was counted

292
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
Because more people means more government

293
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
People would say what why do I have to do it

294
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
And then I would explain to them what this is going to affect

295
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,367
What Rhode Island will get for the next 10 years

296
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,439
And everything from infrastructure money in schools

297
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
2

298
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
The representation we have in Washington

299
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,351
Representation in Washington

300
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
Rhode Island right now has

301
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
Two Congressional reps

302
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
But there are brisk

303
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:59,359
Of losing one of them are state is facing grave danger okay there are 435

304
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Congressional seats in the car

305
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
And every census

306
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,759
We divvy up those seats based on which states are growing in Wichita

307
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,879
And in order for Rhode Island to not lose one of their seats

308
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
The state needs to grow

309
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
By 30000

310
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
People and Carlos

311
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Really doesn't want to lose

312
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
So he proposed a bill that would give

313
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
$10,000 in tax credits

314
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Two ten thousand families

315
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
Families of 3 or more

316
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
If they reside in Rhode Island

317
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
Long enough to be counted

318
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
In the next census

319
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,103
So they can like get their $10,000 and then move away

320
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,383
Could but Carlos

321
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
This is how big they were

322
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
And I should say that

323
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
Is just one of several

324
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Criticisms of

325
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
Of his plan Democrats a subsidized

326
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
Rich because he only wants to give tax credits

327
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
The families who make above a certain threshold

328
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,975
And Republicans are like this is just a waste of money

329
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
Cuz if you do the math

330
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Carlos is built

331
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,047
Lacoste

332
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
100

333
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Million-dollar

334
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
A hundred million dollars that does not

335
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
Theme worth

336
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,495
One extra congressional seat to me I don't know for Carlos

337
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
It is totally worth

338
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
What he sees it

339
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Rhode Island

340
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
Billions of dollars from the Federal

341
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,943
But there's also a lot of federal spending

342
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,247
They can be willed in One Direction or not

343
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
Like for example

344
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,087
Orders of submarines

345
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
To get built in order

346
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
Do you want that extra vote to influence spending

347
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Like that

348
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
We can't

349
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
Stan to take another loss

350
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
If we lose a c

351
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,631
Will be scratching our heads and we could talk about all the things we could have done but it's too late

352
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,471
10 years right now probably forever

353
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
Roberto Carlos lost

354
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
An election by one

355
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,127
I think she just doesn't want to live that nightmare again

356
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Just missing out

357
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
I can understand that

358
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,527
Got to go get a see if I can score one of those

359
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,319
Okay but I need a co-host

360
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
The sentiment

361
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
How much is it worth

362
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,695
Okay we just heard about 2

363
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,511
Really expensive ways to increase our population

364
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Coming up after the break

365
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839

And on the next TED Radio Hour

378
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
Stories of remarkable transformation

379
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
The face

380
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
Ordinary circumstance

381
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,015
I often forget that my limbs are synthetic

382
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
That's how Willie work

383
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
You can find it

384
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
TED Radio Hour

385
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Wherever you listen

386
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,231
Okay so while some countries are putting out

387
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,559
Sexy commercial saying have more babies please

388
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,167
And US states are literally paying people money to move to their towns

389
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
One mayor in a small town in Italy thought

390
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Why not just

391
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Welcome refugees

392
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,431
Is there more than 28 million refugees and asylum-seekers in the world according to the United Nations

393
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
And immigration is

394
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,087
One way that a lot of countries have solved their population problems for decade

395
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,647
Countries like Denmark Italy

396
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
They develop and modernized

397
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
They get richer and their birth rates drop

398
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,327
So we all start to depend a little bit more on

399
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
But in this Italian town

400
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
That familiar story

401
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
Went sideways

402
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
Did you tell us all about it is

403
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:43,359
The one and only Sylvia poggioli NPR senior European correspondent

404
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:48,991
Sylvia welcome to Planet Money thank you thank you for having me tell us about reaction

405
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Oh it's a

406
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,855
The medieval town perched on a hill in

407
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Calabria it's that's

408
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Foot of the Tower

409
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
The Italian boot

410
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,023
And it was until about 20 years ago

411
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,327
Abandoned ghost town with not more than

412
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
Couple thousand

413
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
People living there

414
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,935
Then something happened in the summer of night

415
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
1998

416
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
Hundreds of refugees

417
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Arrived at riachi

418
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,639
You sure that's right in the mayor Domenico Lucano had this idea

419
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,687
A why don't we welcome them

420
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
And he basically offered them

421
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
A place to live in the menu

422
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,063
Empty apartments that

423
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
In the town

424
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
And he offered them places

425
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
To start opening little artists

426
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Beijing shops

427
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,279
They're hardly any businesses now it's full of cafes and shops

428
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,863
I'm not going to say it's the thriving town but it's a living town

429
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,447
It's been called the reactor experiment and several other towns

430
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,775
Definitely were inspired not many but a few started doing it to

431
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,871
Andalou, was he's become quite famous for having done

432
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
But then the

433
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,967
Current Refugee crisis that we all know about

434
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
Happened and that changed

435
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:59,903
Not just the refugee crisis but the arrival of a new government which is very much anti-migraine

436
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
And they Crackdown against

437
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
Aldi's welcoming attitude

438
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Do towards migrants

439
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,327
And medical, was charged

440
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Twist

441
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,143
Basically he was accused of

442
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Enabling

443
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:15,263
And encouraging illegal migration they were said that he was giving

444
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
Refugees

445
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
Jobs that suck like they have to pee

446
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Find some excuse

447
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
In any case he was first put under house arrest

448
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,319
And now he has been banned from living in vrchat he is the current mayor of reactionary but he is not allowed to

449
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
B andreacchi

450
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,623
That's right

451
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,439
How does he feel about that

452
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
He's pretty Furious

453
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,535
Yeah so Sylvia there all these cities

454
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,887
States and countries that are like actually begging for people to move there

455
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
Meanwhile there's this

456
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Global refugee

457
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,519
Cheap prices and it seems like a match made in heaven but

458
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
It's not really happy

459
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,639
Definitely in most of Europe now

460
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
There is a overwhelming auntie

461
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
To my good feeling

462
00:17:56,479 --> 00:18:00,063
All the policies now are making it much harder for migrants

463
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,903
To settle and to make a decent living in these countries

464
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,231
The problem is the migrants heart, stop coming

465
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,023
They're going to always find a way

466
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,607
Also this town Italy also has one of the lowest birth rates

467
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
It's in the world

468
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
So it needs my

469
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Prince if it wants to you know

470
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,287
To make its economy work in the future

471
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Or people

472
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,127
Could just make more babies they could

473
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,943
But doesn't look like people are very willing to do that right

474
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,599
All right Sylvia and just because you are legendary and because my to Cohoes

475

484
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Try to increase

485
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
Is birth rate

486
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Through

487
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Song

488
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
It's time to do our stuff

489
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
Civic duty and I'm not talking about

490
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,207
Beaches fireworks or parades

491
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,023
I'm talking about the stuff after that stuff

492
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,583
I'm talking about making a baby

493
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
Baby

494
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
Yeah
