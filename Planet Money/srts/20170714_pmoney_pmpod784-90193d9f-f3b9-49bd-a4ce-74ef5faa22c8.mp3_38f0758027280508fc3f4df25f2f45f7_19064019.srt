Authority his grandfather was a labor union organizer

58
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544

Patterson Self was

62
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,272
Always looking for a rule to break

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,624
So I was going through my teenage rebellion back in in the 1970s

64
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,208
And I was trying to figure out a great way to repel from this family communist

65
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:15,584
So I grew my hair long that didn't upset my parents I followed the grateful Dad that didn't have any impact

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
But one day

67
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
I came up with the perfect

68
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,984
Rebellion I'm for my family which was to put on a suit in time become a capitalist

69
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,568
And there was nothing I could do to piss off my family more than that

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,224
Router got an economics degree from the University of Chicago and MBA from Stanford and by the time he graduated he had found the purse

71
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
Perfect place to

72
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
To be a cowboy cap

73
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,344
Places grandparents left Russia

74
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,928
Is 1996 after the fall of the Berlin Wall

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
Russia wants to ditch

76
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
Communism overnight

77
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
They have all these old

78
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096
State-owned companies they want to make private

79
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,888
It was some complete

80
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,960
Wild West Gold Rush type of situation

81
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:58,080
The Russian government had basically in their own efforts to go from communism to capitalism

82
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,664
They basically gave all the state assets away for free

83
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,224
So could you walk in and buy a factory

84
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:09,856
You could do anything you walk in by an oil company you can walk in buy a Timber Mill you can walk and do anyting

85
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:15,232
This isn't rocket science you basically could buy an oil company at a 99.9% discount

86
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
The same type of oil company in the west and so

87
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
The real

88
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,351
Trade was

89
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:27,007
You are already going to lose all your money if they take it away from you or is Russia going to get go from Total Chaos to a little bit less

90
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
Chaos because of ghosts

91
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
Total chaos to a little less chaos

92
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
You make 10

93
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
23 times your money

94
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
That was the capitalist dream

95
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,271
Soap router started and invest

96
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,367
Add fund at fund it would eventually be the largest one in Russia with assets worth

97
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
Billions of dollars

98
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,487
And we found out was it just by investing in Russia

99
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,815
He was suddenly thrust into this whole power struggle

100
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Because

101
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
You couldn't just

102
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:58,495
Buy stock in a company and walk away you had to go inside each business get your hands dirty

103
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Figure out

104
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
How a Russian business work

105
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,895
But what I discovered was that some there was a pretty good reason for

106
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,735
Why these companies were so cheap because even if you want to share of the company

107
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:13,599
A share of anything because the people who control these companies the Russian oligarchs

108
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,951
We're basically I'm stealing money from the companies hand-over-fist

109
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
And so at as a matter of necessity

110
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,839
I'm I became an anti-corruption activist

111
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,143
I'm trying to protect my investments

112
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:32,543
And so I just like you I mean someone trying to make money off of a country going through transition

113
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,407
They were but that didn't that there's two ways that people were thinking about making money you could either

114
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,479
Own a company in in own the shares and end

115
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,551
Managed it honestly and have the value of the company rise

116
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
That's that was my way

117
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:50,719
Their way the oligarchs way was to own a company and just suck out all the cash into their pockets

118
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,047
And I worry about the value of the shares but just worried about

119
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Their pockets

120
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
Brother had a strategy

121
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,751
Every time you would discover corruption at one of these companies he was investing in

122
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,055
Alex bozich in the Russian media and

123
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,871
Wild and interesting thing happen

124
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
Each time he did it

125
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
Amanda Vladimir Putin wood

126
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
Step in and make a big show of holding

127
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,319
High-level oligarchy

128
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
Accountable

129
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,439
Uptime Putin was not the all-powerful leader of Russia that we know now

130
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,255
He was a new president with pretty weak Authority

131
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,583
My poop was making a big show of fighting

132
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,191
Corruption that's how he was gaining popularity and he especially liked the target corruption

133
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
Among his political rivals

134
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,335
We had a Confluence of interests the oligarchs were stealing power from him

135
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
And they were stealing money for me

136
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
The bill Browder did not

137
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
No Vladimir

138
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,783
What is conflict of interest lasted for years the arrangement work

139
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
The Russian economy boom

140
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,879
Putin amassed an incredible amount of power

141
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
Embroider got rich

142
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
But at some point routers

143
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,999
Stop being useful to Putin

144
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,815
Winston had the power he needed he didn't need

145
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,607
Fresh the remaining oligarchs

146
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
A foreigner like Browder

147
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
Was just

148
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Starting to get in the way

149
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,287
In November 2005 Bill Browder was at the Moscow Airport

150
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
Houston the VIP lounge of course

151
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:15,711
And then into this room stormed for heavily-armed Border guards who grabbed me

152
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,831
Frog March me down to the basement of the airport into the Detention Center on this is not very nice

153
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
I'm thinking waffles

154
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
What the heck

155
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
What's going on here

156
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Heart pumping adrenaline

157
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Flowing through my veins

158
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,815
What have I done am I being arrested

159
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,143
Where why there are they taking me why they doing this and they wouldn't tell me anything

160
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
He's locked up overnight

161
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
And then the next morning the guards reappear

162
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
And say

163
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
You've been declared a threat to National Security

164
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,407
You're out of here you're out of Russia we are supporting you on the next flight

165
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
They grabbed me

166
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,783
Woke me right up to the airplane stick me in the middle seat on the airplane flight

167
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,599
And that that was last time I was in Russia

168
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
I love how they stick you in the middle

169
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:00,255
Believe me I was very happy to be on that airplane we could have put me in the toilet and I would have been

170
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
I would have been happy

171
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
Bill Browder had no more allies in Russia

172
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,887
Any new the Clock Was tickin

173
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
He moved to London

174
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
He told all his employees to leave Russia

175
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Quickly as possible

176
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
Insurgent quietly cell

177
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823

Who would buy them

180
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
And it worked

181
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,199
He got his money out routers gamble on Russia paid off

182
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
Anybody never given a thought to Russia again

183
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
But more than a year later

184
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
He gets this panic

185
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
Call from the last employee left

186
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
In his Moscow office

187
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,535
I got a phone call from from my from secretary saying there's

188
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
There's 25 officers here what should I do

189
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:41,215
And I said I don't know let me call my lawyer I called up my lawyer guy American guy named Jameson

190
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:47,103
Etta James in my office is being rated what should I do when he said I don't know my officers are being rated as well they're looking for your stuff

191
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
I remember there was no money

192
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Leptin

193
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
Office there was no real business being done

194
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,039
And there they were just a few.

195
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
And that's what the police walked out

196
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
Obviously this all seems really suspicious

197
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,743
Router wanted to figure out what they were up to so he found attacks

198
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
Named Sarah Kate Meghan

199
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
Sergei was the smartest lawyer

200
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
In Moscow

201
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
Objectively he was one of these people

202
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
I could do 10 things in the time

203
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Others to do one

204
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
Red circles around everybody else

205
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,895
Is 35 years old that's incredibly

206
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Smart

207
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,735
But most importantly honest and Earnest man

208
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
And

209
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,111
We are we hired him to help us figure out what was going on

210
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
Is there any tracks the documents

211
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
The police stole

212
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,255
She find something out it's kind of amazing

213
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
Why the police had these documents

214
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,655
These dogs Were Somehow used to transfer ownership

215
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,215
Of the company away from Bill Browder

216
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Just some Russian dude

217
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,055
And that guy clearly had a plan

218
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,895
You know how in the United States someone can get a hold of your Social Security

219
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,503
And I apply for a tax refund in your name to the government it is a pretty

220
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Common scam here

221
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Well

222
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,367
Apparently the same thing was happening with routers

223
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Company

224
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,463
Whoever took control of these documents of the company

225
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
Apply for a tax refund

226
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
From the Russian government

227
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
A massive

228
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Tax refund

229
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
230 million dollars

230
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
What's the largest tax refund in the history of Russia

231
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
And it was approved

232
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
And paid out

233
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
The next day

234
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
With no questions asked

235
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
I'm not sure there's any government in the world

236
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,039
Who would give you a 230 million dollar tax refund

237
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:34,111
The next day I mean it just seems insane it

238
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Service engine soon to attack

239
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
Lawyer like Sergei magnitsky

240
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
And he thinks you know

241
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
This has to be

242
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
A criminal plot

243
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
You have to involve

244
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
The rug police officers who took the documents

245
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
Probably includes tax officials

246
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
Sausser Caicos

247
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
To the Russian

248
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
He tells them what happened

249
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,311
He testified

250
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,639
He takes it all the way the top telling them that this

251
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
This could very well be

252
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
The largest

253
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
Text scam in Russian

254
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
History

255
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
And then we sat back

256
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
And waited for the good guys to get the bad guys

257
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
It just turned out

258
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
Heading Putin's Russia

259
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
There are no good guys

260
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
Somebody clearly wanted this story

261
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
To go away

262
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,631
And the easiest way to make a scandal go away

263
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
What's to make Sergei

264
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Go away

265
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
November 24th 2008

266
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
Police officers showed up at staircase door width

267
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
An arrest warrant

268
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
His wife was in a total

269
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
State of

270
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Panic

271
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,991
And he tried to calm her down he said don't worry I'll be back tomorrow

272
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
He gets thrown in prison

273
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
Pretrial detention is what they called it

274
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,415
But it becomes clear pretty quickly that what they really wanted

275
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
Was to blame someone

276
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
For that giant

277
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
Tax fraud

278
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:48,863
They kept telling him to confess and Sara gay being a good lawyer that he was

279
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
Documented what happened to him every single day

280
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
They put him in cells

281
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,031
With 14 inmates in eight beds

282
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,591
And left lights on 24 hours a day

283
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
I put them in cells with no heat

284
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
And no window panes in December in Moscow

285
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Nearly froze to death

286
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
How they put them in cells with no toilet

287
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
Just a hole in the floor where the sewage with bubble

288
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
They moving from cell to cell to cell

289
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
In the middle of the night

290
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
I think they moved him 28

291
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,583
Different times ms358 days in detention

292
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,447
And all through the Sergei magnitsky is filing legal complaints about his treat

293
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
He filed

294
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,543
450 formal complaint

295
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Over a year

296
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,383
He competed to believe that a judge somewhere

297
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
Which stop what was happening to

298
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,967
Trudy had this strange

299
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
Idealistic view of the law

300
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,599
He was like a lawyer's lawyer and he really believed

301
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,439
The law would ultimately overcome everything he knew there's a lot of

302
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
Human Frailty in the system in the government

303
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:53,119
In the police etcetera buddy but he also believe that ultimately the law was the law

304
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:58,239
And while all of this is going on Browder is reading each of these excruciating update

305
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,823
Spitzer gauge riding he's learning about sergei's awful conditions

306
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
But he's powerless to do anything

307
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,967
No one ever answered any of Sergei magnitsky

308
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
And eventually got sick

309
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Critically

310
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Instead of putting him in the emergency room

311
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,415
They put him into an isolation cell

312
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
They changed him to a bed

313
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,791
And it a tribe guards with rubber batons

314
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Beat him

315
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
Until he died

316
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
He was 37 years old

317
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,495
He left a wife and two children

318
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,567
I was November 16th 2009

319
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
Seven and half years ago

320
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,687
Bill Browder found out what happened to Sergei the next day

321
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
And he was stunned

322
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
What happened how

323
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
No

324
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Happy

325
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
And when I finally

326
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Was able to

327
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
Calm down enough to look at the situation objectively

328
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
It was clear that I had only one choice

329
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,095
Which was to put aside everything else I was doing

330
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
An undervote

331
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,775
All of my time energy and resources to go after the people that killed him and make sure they faced Justice

332
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
Bill Browder cannot travel to

333
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
He cannot sue the people

334
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
He thinks are responsible

335
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,735
But since he's a finance guy router knows how to

336
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,271
Hit them where it hurts

337
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
In the bank account

338
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,159
It was already concern in the financial World about corruption in Russia and

339
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,231
Sergei magnitsky dramatic story becomes

340
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
This symbol

341
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
Just how bad

342
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
Things have gotten there

343
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,703
Router tells his story again and again and again and he said if you want to fight corruption in Russia

344
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,263
You want to get Justice for Sergei magnitsky

345
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
Then let's

346
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
Freeze the money

347
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,871
Of the people responsible it's freeze their bank account

348
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
After years of lobbying

349
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,479
Router gets a u.s. senator on board

350
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
They dropped a bill

351
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
What's the name of the spread

352
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
The magnitsky ACT

353
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
Up 2012

354
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
And it passes

355
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
The u.s. congress with huge bipartisanship

356
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,719
This act

357
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:59,583
Includes a list of Russian names of people suspected to have a role in Saturday's death

358
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,423
And the law bans these people from entering the US and

359
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
Freezes their assets

360
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,007
They're Now 44 names on the magnets

361
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
And some of them are the most

362
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,359
Powerful people in Russia

363
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
Either we now have the

364
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,479
Head of the Russian State investigative committee there FBI

BM deputy

367
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,647
Prosecutor Russia Victor green is on the list

368
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Have a deputy

369
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
Interior minister

370
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
Alexia nietzscheans on the

371
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Judges

372
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,863
And the police officers the ones who did the raid

373
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
The ones that custody of the documents

374
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
The jailers

375
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
All these people are on the list

376
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
You know who is not on the list

377
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Vladimir

378
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,431
Putin but apparently he was majorly pissed off by the mere existence

379
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
Of this list because this was

380
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,551
This is the US the world really taking aim at members was governor

381
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
These are the people closest

382
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,695
Yeah an alarm even possible for them to do business in the United States do business with

383
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
US Bank switch

384
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,023
Pretty much means business anywhere in the world

385
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,583
No the Russian government says it had nothing

386
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
To do with Sergei magnitsky

387
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,775
That he died of natural causes and if there's anybody involved who committed fraud it's there he magnitsky and Bill Browder

388
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
So Putin retaliated

389
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
And he retaliated within days

390
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,991
And this is how we did it if you remember back then thousands of Americans were adopting

391
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,527
Russian children from orphanage

392
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831
Who's big thing in the 90s

393
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
And who decides to ban

394
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:30,207
U.s. citizens from adopting Russian kids

395
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
Never mind that this move

396
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Hurt

397
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
Children babies hurt

398
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Family

399
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Wanted

400
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
U.s. citizens to be out

401
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
What she wanted us

402
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,263
I hate this because he wanted to send a message

403
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
That the US Congress

404
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
Should I unfreeze it

405
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
His friends assets

406
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Okay so

407
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,431
Now let's bring the story back to this week

408
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,271
Natalia veselnitskaya the Russian lawyer that Trump jr. met with

409
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:59,903
I spent the last few years trying to pressure the US to repeal the magnitsky ACT

410
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,511
She lobbied us officials just try to discredit Bill Browder

411
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
And that's why she wanted to meet with

412
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Trump jr. so badly

413
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
And when they said afterwards oh

414
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
We just talked about adoption

415
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
What they're really saying is that they

416
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
Talked about the magnitsky

417
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
Russia

418
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,127
Wants to know

419
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,175
Whether Donald Trump would be willing

420
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,783
To negotiate to talk about this issue of Russian bank account

421
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
To talk about this issue of the magnitsky

422
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
Versus

423
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,719
He is not at all surprised that Sarah gay story would come up again in the news

424
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,535
Russia has never given up this fight

425
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
Russian officials have

426
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,399
Called Browder a liar and issued arrest warrants against him

427
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:48,287
They make comments that suggested life isn't danger to and and he is well aware that people

428
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
Who have fallen out of favour with

429
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
The Kremlin have wound up

430
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Dead

431
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,759
I got I got to be living completely different life than the average person which is to think very carefully about

432
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,831
Everything I do and what risks I take by doing it

433
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
I never go to the same restaurant twice

434
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,183
Really

435
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
You can't go back to a favorite restaurant

436
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Brother went to Russia

437
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
Cuz it was the wild

438
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,703
Because they were no rules and so it seemed like an easy place

439
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
To make a ton of money

440
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
And now

441
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
You know talking him he just

442
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
He just blames himself

443
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,151
Forever wanting to set foot

444
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Russian flag

445
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,967
The lesson that I've learned is that

446
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Laws matter

447
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
The rule of law matters

448
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Integrity matters

449
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,183
And if you don't have that in a in a

450
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
System in a society

451
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
And pretty much everything is worthless

452
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
Something to keep in mind

453
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
The next time a Russian lawyer calls you up

454
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655

Robert that was so funny I didn't get it each week they try to get it why we do what we do

472
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,111
Why are some people really great at recognizing faces

473
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,927
Or why do some people lie more than others

00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
