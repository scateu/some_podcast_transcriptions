11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
Drugs

12
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,072
And there is one brief

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,096
Bleep swear word

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:45,056
I got so loud here Lexie and I are at an intersection in Brooklyn Myrtle and Broadway

15
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:51,456
I think this is the most interception I've ever seen we get bodegas everywhere is Rost in graffiti cars criss-crossing

16
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,272
Through here whatever Direction they want to go and

17
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,552
Like the best thing of all

18
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,600
This guy standing behind us wearing a New York

19
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
Yankee Pat who keeps asking if he can swear into our microphones

20
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:09,120
Hey wait we came to this intersection because about 2 years ago something

21
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
Totally bizarre happy

22
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
There is one essential key Witness

23
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,752
Door waiting for him to meet us

24
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,568
I think he's actually walking up right behind you now

25
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,616
Bryan Mitsubishi man

26
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,176
Brian Arthur is 40 years old

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,968
He works as an overnight doorman

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
And in July 2006

29
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,600
Teen he was just getting home from a shift it was about 9 in the morning

30
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,392
He was walking down this street

31
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,952
As I sat in the corner over there

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,000
App that block is what you see

33
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Passengers

34
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
On the floor

35
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,352
I'm just shaking and stuff like that

36
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
Record this

37
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,728
Brian decides to stream what he is seeing on Facebook

38
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:50,592
Driving directions 5 gamble at Myrtle and Broadway Hill

39
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,432
Ryan toy video shows two maybe three guys on their feet but just like

40
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
Wobbly

41
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
Like a bowling pin that won't follow

42
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
She got slumped over the top of a

43
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,000
The fire hydrant and Brian swings the camera to the left and out of the guy in the middle of the

44
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,864
But Street

45
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
It's too crazy

46
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,240
Turn out 5 6 7 of the zombified people

47
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
EMTs that started dealing with people on the ground

48
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
Shaking and Brian

49
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Cannibal

50
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,944
Crazy like you

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
What Brian was seeing was a mass overdose

52
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,064
More than 30 people end up in the hospital

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,392
After taking a mysterious train of what sometimes called

54
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Synthetic marijuana

55
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
But it is totally not like marijuana

56
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,024
Or like any other drug before it real

57
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,584
Back in the days when there was dope and it was crack

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Epidemic was

59
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
Similar to this but

60
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,984
I've lived here for 20 plus years I've never seen disciple

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
Jackson drug

62
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,848
Ring video went viral and the Brooklyn zombie outbreak

63
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
Became national news

64
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
And these bizarre outbreaks

65
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
They keep happening

66
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
The latest outbreak of synthetic pot people are sickened on Skid Row from

67
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
And dozens of hospitalizations in Mississippi and send it least 56 people to the hospital here in Illinois

68
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:18,144
Even more than 100 overdoses in 48 hours

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,008
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Kenny Malone and I'm Alexi Horowitz Ghazi

70
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:27,872
When you watch coverage of the drug epidemic in the US you will hear the word synthetic

71
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
Over and over

72
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,504
Synthetic opioid synthetic cathinones and synthetic cannabinoids

73
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
Most of human history

74
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,392
Drugs came from plants if you wanted to get people high you had to grow things

75
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,512
Poppies coca plants marijuana things like LSD ecstasy meth

76
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,096
Chemicals synthesized in the lab instead of grown in the field

77
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:53,984
But over the last two decades the illicit drug trade has undergone a new kind of Industrial Revolution

78
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
There's been an explosion in the variety of synthetic drugs

79
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
They've gotten more potent more profitable

80
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,664
And you can now become a drug kingpin with just

81
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,248
An internet connection and email address of a chemical Factory in China

82
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,088
Today on the show The Story of the synthetic drug Revolution

83
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,440
And how it may all lead back to one well-intentioned professor

84
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
In South Carolina

85
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,215

A story to take us to a lot of characters

96
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
Across the world so we're going to break this into

97
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
3 chapter

98
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Chapter one

99
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
The white girl

100
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
As in

101
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Lab coats

102
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
First if you could just introduce yourself

103
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
Yes this is Marilyn huestis

104
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,623
I am a professor at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia

105
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,951
In movies about global zombie your pathogen outbreaks

106
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,023
There's always a moment where somebody sees the outbreak coming

107
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Before almost anyone else

108
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,863
First story about the synthetic drug epidemic

109
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
One of those moments came about 10 years ago

110
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
In Germany

111
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Add a professional confer

112
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,823
The conference was the International Association

113
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
A forensic tox

114
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Psychologist

115
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Kia

116
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
For sure

117
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:44,319
Marilyn actually used to be the president of this organization she's kind of a big deal in the world of drug abuse research

118
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
But when Maryland showed up

119
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
The conference at

120
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
She said everyone was talking about this

121
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
Your drug outbreak

122
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
In German

123
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
People been getting high and acting

124
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Ferry Street

125
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:58,143
They stopped at a stoplight and the light will change and change and change

126
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,215
And they would never go and the people are honking

127
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
Silver crashes

128
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
And they would call it

129
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Spice

130
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,847
You'll hear this called a few names

131
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
Synthetic marijuana synthetic

132
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
The cannabinoids

133
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
K2 in Germany though it was spice

134
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,527
Andrew officials managed to get their hands on some of

135
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,647
When they looked at the spice and appear to be just a mixture of like dried plants

136
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,183
So the mystery was

137
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
What the hell

138
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
Is the stuff

139
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,583
Are these some new kinds of plants with never-seen-before are these plants laced with some

140
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,119
Is there

141
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,727
Charming German scientist who can help us figure this out my name is Kristen Stewart

142
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
Christian is a research pharmacist

143
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
Specializes in chemical analysis

144
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,919
He gets a call from a German official explaining that there has been this outbreak

145
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
Male Maltipoo

146
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:50,111
Became interested in smoking

147
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Incense mix

148
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
It was called

149
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,559
And that's a spice the German government sends a sample of this spice over to Christians lab in

150
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
In Frankfurt which by the way

151
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Apparently is very strange

152
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,959
Yeah it's looks like a witch's house

153
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
The Christian gets to work

154
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:09,311
Try to figure out what is in this mysterious spice blend

155
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
Injected into an hplc

156
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:18,015
Dad what you know of course gives you the UV specs which goes through the

157
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,367
Hplc column as we all know gets you to the gcms

158
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,695
SO gas chromatography, Richmond

159
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,023
Of course so anyway here's what he eventually figure

160
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
People were not getting high from the dried play

161
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
They were getting high

162
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
Because the dried plants

163
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
We're sprayed with a

164
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,239
The chemical and he was even able to figure out the name of

165
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Jwh

166
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
O-18

167
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,639
Yeah jwho

168
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,479
182 Professor Marilyn huestis is that the German conference

169
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
I'm hearing this epic Tale

170
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
The weird symptoms the mysterious plant mix

171
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
The German chemist in a witch's house

172
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
And when it's revealed that the

173
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,951
The chemical these plants were sprayed with

174
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Was called jwh

175
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
08

176
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
Marilyn is like

177
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Holy crap

178
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
Those are just some random letters

179
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
Those are initials

180
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,983
Stands for John W Huffman

181
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,055
Who is an excellent medicinal chemist

182
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,103
I knew him personally

183
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
And he was

184
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
You know how highly respected for his work

185
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
I'm back

186
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
Hey John hello

187
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
LOL

188
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Yeah I can hear

189
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:28,927
John W Huffman is 86 years old either retired organic chemistry professor from Clemson University

190
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,511
City in South Carolina and yes we know that I am Professor Hoffman

191
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Sounds like the name of a scientist

192
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
List from a stoner movie

193
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,143
John W Huffman is not that

194
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Have you ever

195
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
Taken one of your compounds

196
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
No

197
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
You say that pretty emphatically

198
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
John part of this story

199
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
Starts back in the early

200
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
Let me explain how we got

201
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
End of the synthetic cannabinoid

202
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,111
A few years earlier scientist to discover the thing in the body

203
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Did they called the

204
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Cannabinoid receptor

205
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
One thing it does get you high from pot

206
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
It's the party body that

207
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767
THC interact

208
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,119
What does receptor seem to be connected to all sorts of other things in your body as well

209
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Your sleep

210
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
Your appetite

211
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,519
Pain which meant scientist might be able to discover a new medicine

212
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,847
But first they needed to figure out how this receptor even works

213
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
And that sounded like a

214
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Fun puzzles

215
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
Attack

216
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
And anyway I

217
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
Did some half-baked

218
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
Computer modeling study

219
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:32,159
Hey John I don't want to cut you off but are you aware that half-baked has marijuana connotations

220
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
Are you making a pun

221
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
No okay I just wasn't sure

222
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
I wasn't aware there's a there's a movie called half

223
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
It's very funny

224
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:45,727
I'll have to look it up John shop was to synthesize brand new chemicals that might trigger this resep

225
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
And then those compounds got tested on mice and rat brain

226
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
So John start synthesizing them

227
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
And for record-keeping

228
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
P names each new compound in his research

229
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Using

230
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
His initials and then a number

231
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,807
So jwho one

232
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Kwh

233
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
O2 eventually he makes

234
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Jwh

235
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
08

236
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,951
It's simply a

237
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,255
Light yellow goo

238
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
It was the 18th

239
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
Compounded resynthesized

240
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
Then that this series and

241
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
We set it off and it was

242
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
Pretty potent never thought anything of it

243
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,103
John and his colleagues eventually created and tested over 300 brand new comp

244
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,199
Jwh o-18 was literally one of hundreds

245
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
I forgot about

246
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,039
Until about 15 years later

247
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
What to get to eat

248
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,367
Polly mail was from a

249
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
Bloggers in Germany

250
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
And

251
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
He said that

252
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:45,887
Fayette discovered that one of our compounds had been found in a drug called spice

253
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,495
John was pretty sure he knew how his initials wound up on some drugs in some German

254
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,847
When John and his colleagues created those 300 some synthetic cannabinoids

255
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,407
They did what scientists are supposed to do

256
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
They publish their findings

257
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,015
They explained which of these compounds triggered the cannabinoid

258
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
Receptor what kinds of effects got triggered

259
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
And they also included directions

260
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
How to wrap a

261
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,023
John was almost certain that some enterprising chemist head look at his paper

262
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,095
Notice that jwho 18 was one of the most potent

263
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Compound

264
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
And then

265
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Follow the directions

266
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
How to make it again

267
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
The compounds are actually

268
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
Not difficult

269
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,615
We talkin like Easy Bake Oven children's toy easy to make

270
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
Yeah almost

271
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
You see that somewhere

272
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
Your initials

273
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
And that number

274
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
And like what do you think

275
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
I thought that this

276
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,415
Probably that was probably inevitable that somebody was going to use it to get high

277
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,255
Authorities think that the German version of John's compound was manufactured

278
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
Somewhere in China which makes sense

279
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
That's because

280
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Over the last few decades

281
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
The US has outsourced

282
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
The ton of pharmaceutical Manufacturing

283
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
To China

284
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
That's how to build a

285
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
The capacity of

286
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Chemical laboratories

287
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
To produce

288
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311
Any kind of

289
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
Including

290
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
One ripped from a science teacher

291
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,687
What we don't know is exactly who did it

292
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,503
What lab it came from or precisely when it happened

293
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
But it's hard to overstate

294
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
What this man

295
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
For the Global Drug

296
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,671
It was one of the first signs that an industrial revolution had

297
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:17,535
Because think about how hard it used to be to get people high by messing with the cannabinoids

298
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,607
You needed marijuana plants needed space

299
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
Grow them sunlight to grow them

300
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
Needed people to do it

301
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
I need a Time

302
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Hands of time

303
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
And after all of that

304
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
This giant plant would produce

305
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
A little bit of stuff

306
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
That would get you stoned

307
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,943
Jwh o-18 had only been tested on Mouse in

308
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
Rat brains but

309
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
It seemed to do something

310
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
People's brains

311
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
And more importantly

312
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
It was way more efficient

313
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
Produce and distribute the marijuana

314
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,511
German officials Outlaw jwho 18 the months after was identified

315
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
But it didn't matter

316
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
Chemist just tweet their formulas

317
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
And stayed one step ahead of the law

318
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
Which brings us to chapter 2

319
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
The legal grave

320
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Subtitle

321
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Better call Kurtz

322
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:07,711
At kurzman Grant law office

323
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,039
Your rights as a commercial for attorney Mark

324
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
Kurtzmann and this

325
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Is attorney Mark

326
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
I

327
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Received the call

328
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
From a client

329
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
He called me and asked me what I knew about K2

330
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
And I asked him why he was asking me about a mountain

331
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
In the Himalayas

332
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,751
Back in 2008 Martin know anything about spice

333
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
K2 but

334
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
He was better prepared than almost anyone

335
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,895
To navigate the legal grey area around

336
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,735
Represented the owners of so-called head shop

337
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,575
Places that sell bongs and rolling papers and other things that

338
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
Could be used to smoke marijuana

339
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,439
But back when marijuana was illegal in most States

340
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:54,559
A big part of Mark's job was to make sure his clients didn't say they were selling weed paraphernalia

341
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,143
You have to instruct them on how to speak with their

342
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
Customers

343
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
Because they cannot be

344
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,799
Offering things for use with illegal substances

345
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
So it's it's a

346
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
It's a scripting

347
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Game

348
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Quite frankly

349
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,967
Where everybody knows everybody else is talking about

350
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
In 2008

351
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
Headshots Worthy

352
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
Perfect place

353
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
To start selling spice

354
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
It's a marks client start calling him

355
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,183
Batman saying hey Mark

356
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
There's a new product

357
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
On the market

358
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
We can get it on the internet from China

359
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,863
We may or may not already be selling it

360
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Is that alright

361
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,447
Marcus like let me look into this

362
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
And what he discovered was that many synthetic cannabinoids

363
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
At that point

364
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,103
We're not explicitly banned on a federal level

365
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,151
There was this one law Mark was

366
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
Primarily worried

367
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
The federal analog

368
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Which essentially said

369
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
You can't knowingly sell something

370
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
It does the same thing

371
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
As an outlet stops

372
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,415
Since the Mark was pretty sure

373
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
She could get around that

374
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,255
So Mark calls as clients back and tells them

375
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
I think you can sell this

376
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
But

377
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,863
Here are some very important point

378
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
Number one

379
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Please just be a responsible

380
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
Don't sell this to people underage

381
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,287
18 or if I don't know you think they're going to smoke it

382
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
And then get behind the wheel of a

383
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Number two

384
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
You cannot Market this as a

385
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
A drug

386
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,479
The packages need to say not for human consumption

387
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
And your employees they need to stick to a tight skirt

388
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
Will you play the cashier for me

389
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
At at a store

390
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
So I walk should I heard about it

391
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
I'm pretty naive I'm saying

392
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
Is this the

393
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,583
The spice that my friends have been talking about is this is the right stuff

394
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
And you would be able to say what

395
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,935
I have no idea what your friends are speaking of

396
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,543
They told me there's this thing that's like a little bit like pot and I can

397
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,871
I don't like gas smoke it or snort it or something

398
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Not to my knowledge

399
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,247
And if that's something that you want to get you can't buy anything here

400
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
Please leave

401
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
Okay so that would be a bad way for me to go to one of your stores that are complying if you if you wanted to

402
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Death

403
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
W Broadway

404
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,047
But four more Savvy customers who didn't ask a lot of questions

405
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,167
They can walk into a head shop by a packet of synthetic cannabinoids and walk out the door

406
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,007
I just want to just head shops you may remember this weird. Of time

407
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,823
Where you would walk into a bodega or a gas station

408
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
And they were all of these

409
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
Bright shiny package

410
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,431
Labeled is like incense

411
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
What are potpourri

412
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
I personally speaking I had no idea what any other way

413
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,039
Sue Perkins

414
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
But what it was

415
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
Was a drug Market in

416
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
In plain sight

417
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
Notably drug enforcement officials were not aware of this

418
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
Problem many states

419
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
We're trying to ban particular strains of

420
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Synthetic cannabinoids

421
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
As they popped up butt

422
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
Made made the problem worse

423
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Because the chemist

424
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,679
Making these

425
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
We just change their recipe

426
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
One expert told us it was like a hydras

427
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,359
You stop one strain three or four new ones my pop up to take its place

428
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,943
It's not what it started as spice in Germany eventually turned into

429
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
Dozens of different products

430
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,015
With different strains of chemicals

431
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
Different fancy packages

432
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
Sporting

433
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
Ridiculous branding

434
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Krypton for one

435
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
Mr. happy there was banana cream nuke

436
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,559
I can't tell if that sounds

437
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
Delicious and days

438
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,911
The exploding synthetic cannabinoid Market was

439
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
Quite profitable for marks

440
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,775
All of a sudden

441
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
Significance

442
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
They would buy something for

443
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,919
Pennies and they would sell it $2

444
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,759
I mean that's a thousand percent markup

445
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,063
The clients who previously have been making

446
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,647
Five six seven hundred thousand dollars yearly making

447
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,463
4 5 6 7

448
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
Did you ever try the product

449
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
No

450
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,071
Were you worried about

451
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
The

452
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
Chemical impacts of it

453
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,751
I don't take unknown substances into my body

454
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,823
I think that's incredibly risky

455
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
End

456
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
Very stupid thing to do

457
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,759
But you're okay with other people doing it

458
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,599
I'm okay with people making their own decisions

459
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,415
About what they do with their own bodies

460
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,231
So long as they are not doing it in a way

461
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
That is going to be directly harmful to other

462
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,143
Word got out that Mark was a guy who could help you sell this stuff

463
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,727
Legally he did insist that his clients got their chemicals tested

464
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,311
To make sure that there weren't obvious poisons or banned chemicals

465
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
He ended up with around 50

466
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,919
Clients from Pet Shop owners to wholesalers

467
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
Importing from China

468
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
And for a while it became his entire business

469
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,039
This period of time

470
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,135
Is one of the big reasons the synthetic drug Market got so big from the Des Moines

471
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,975
For a few years customers could buy legal substances

472
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Cheap

473
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Potent

474
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
And would not show up

475
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
On standard drug

476
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,167
But eventually marks part of the spies party started to wind down around

477
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
2011

478
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:53,567
It's a little complicated but Mark lost a legal Challenge and felt like he couldn't tell his clients in good faith

479
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
But they could still sell this stuff legally

480
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,407
And then in 2012

481
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,247
President Obama signed a synthetic drug abuse prevention Act

482
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,295
Which explicitly band

483
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
A broadly

484
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
Absent that accept

485
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
And so

486
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,695
Anybody who wanted to follow the law

487
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
New

488
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
At that point

489
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,303
You may not like it maybe

490
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
It's unfair

491
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,631
Now your recourse is Go lobby

492
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Congress because you can't

493
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
Say anymore

494
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,799
I can do it because I don't understand it because stats

495
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Ben lost

496
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
So basically what you're saying is

497
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,407
Once the writing was on the wall like

498
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
I guess in this case

499
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
It literally wants to Federal legislation was

500
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Was dry

501
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,039
You were just like

502
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
I have no more

503
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
If you want me

504
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,927
To help you do this I'm not going to do it

505
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,767
There's no tightrope to walk anymore

506
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,047
It is all cut and dry

507
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
And I'm gone

508
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Yep

509
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,423
So it's all fixed it no more spice

510
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,191
No problem

511
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,471
Yeah sure

512
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
Okay so we had the white coats

513
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
We had to leave a gray area

514
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
And after the break

515
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,895
The spice world turns into a full-fledged

516
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
Black Market

517
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,711
Can we visit a lab of scientists

518
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
Trying to

519
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Predict the

520
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,575
This message comes from NPR sponsor

521
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
Capital One

522
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,647
Capital One is reimagining banking

523
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,207
I offering accounts with no fees or minimum

524
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
That can be open from anywhere

525
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Are in 5 min

526
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Capital One

527
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,071
What's in your wallet

528
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,607
Capital One na

529
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,911
Chapter 3

530
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
The black

531
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,239
You will recall the Brooklyn zombie

532
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:31,359
This is crazy like the Romulan over here just happened

533
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,151
Years after jwh

534
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
Hoat

535
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,223
Was first identified on the streets of

536
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
Which means chemist

537
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,575
Have been tweaking and morphing their formulas

538
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
48 years

539
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,999
So whatever caused this outbreak was many generations removed from what John Huffman have created in his lab

540
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
And

541
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
Many times more potent

542
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,375
Go tell your kids please tell your family

543
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,959
Okay to stay off of that man

544
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Topman

545
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
Police knew the Brooklyn zombies had taken some form of

546
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
K2 or synthetic

547
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,967
Cannabinoid they're able to figure out that it was being sold under the name

548
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
AK-47 24 Karat

549
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:15,903
They had no clue what chemicals were actually in this product

550
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,720
So they didn't know how to tell if other people were overdosing on the same

551
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,280
Drug they didn't know how best to treat those people

552
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,096
And if I happened to catch the person putting it out on the street

553
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,656
You can't successfully prosecute without knowing what

554
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Chemical is

555
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,240
And so authorities got a hold of some of this

556
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
AK-47

557
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
24-karat gold stuff

558
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,080
I also got some

559
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
Some blood and urine samples from

560
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Taking it

561
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,712
And they sent all of this off to a special lab

562
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
In San Francisco

563
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:47,392
Did you ever see the Facebook live of that outbreak I did actually medicinal chemist Sam Bannister

564
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,720
With a drug science research group based out of a Lab at UC Santa

565
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
San Francisco

566
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,280
The group has kind of a long name

567
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,632
It's called psychoactive surveillance Consortium and Analysis Network

568
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
They call it

569
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,680
P scan for short

570
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
P-scan

571
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,496
Intentional

572
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,800
Like like checking people's urine

573
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,408
Anyway they were the group that was asked to figure out what the Brooklyn zombies

574
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
We were able to identify

575
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:16,320
That a particular compound was responsible this drug called amb-fubinaca

576
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:21,184
Identify the number of days

577
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,584
From disclosing a lot of related molecules Pfizer pharmaceutical

578
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,960
Just like jwh o18 amb fubinaca appears to be a recipe

579
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
Straight from the literature

580
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,568
Instead of an academic Journal this one came from patent

581
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
Over 500 strains

582
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,432
Five new synthetic compounds have been identified on the

583
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,272
Some word invented by enterprising blackmark

584
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,296
Chemist but

585
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112
A lot of those dreams seem to still get poached

586
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,160
From legitimate scientific Outlet

587
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,744
And this Sam Bannister says is a very troubling problem

588
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:00,096
Science is built on publishing experiments in a way that can be replicated

589
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:04,192
Major trying to do legitimate Research into the possibilities or the

590
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,984
The dangers of synthetic cannabinoids

591
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,288
You run the risk of making things worse

592
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,568
Case in point

593
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,872
A synthetic drug that was found

594
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,152
In Europe not so long ago

595
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,944
I was contacted by

596
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,016
The head of the Finnish police because it actually intercepted

597
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
I'm at the Border level in Finland

598
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,344
Andre from Hong Kong

599
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,160
1kg of sdb oo6

600
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,720
1 kg

601
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,304
12 sdb as in Sam D Bannister

602
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,448
At least one compound Sam had made for legitimate purposes seem to have been poached from an academic Journal

603
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,240
And then manufactured is a brand new

604
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,056
And he was shocked because it happened super fast

605
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:44,896
That was detected approximately six months after that article went online

606
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:50,272
It's a really pretty short short turnaround for his part when Sam discovers a new compound

607
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,832
And he's very intentionally does not publish it right

608
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,928
And this lab Sam works with is taking a radical approach to the synthetic

609
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
They have this one project that is known as

610
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
The prophetic

611
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
Prophetic as in

612
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,328
Trying to predict the

613
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
What building

614
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,936
A library of the drugs that will probably emerge on the Straits

615
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
In the next few years

616
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,800
So you're like searching for that street drugs of the future

617
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:18,176
I think that's probably exactly it salmon or trying to invent new synthetic drugs

618
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
Before the qemists on the black market

619
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,040
That way when a new drug does hit the streets

620
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:28,160
At least the prophetic Library can help officials identify what people have taken and maybe treat us

621
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
Officials can also use that

622
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,768
Information to Outlaw new compounds as they

623
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,328
But Sam says

624
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
The law is not going to change

625
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
The economic

626
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
Pics of the synthetic

627
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,984
It is just so profitable

628
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
To make and sell these drugs

629
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,568
For example Sam says

630
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,104
Look at amb-fubinaca

631
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
The drug from the Brooklyn zombie

632
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,968
I am Baker Binaca could be obtained from China

633
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:56,576
At about three and a half thousand US dollars for 1 kg of material

634
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,648
And we know that that's sort of at least

635
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
Somewhere between

636
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
Mental calculation

637
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,352
Somewhere between probably 500000 and a million dices

638
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,168
A dose that Sam says would sell for about a dollar app

639
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Meaning

640
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,776
If you can get just three and a half thousand dollars worth of this product

641
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
In the country

642
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,824
You could sell it

643
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,872
For more than 500,000

644
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
Like I think it's just

645
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
Truly ruthless profiteering I mean there is money to be made on an enormous scale and I think that's really

646
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,672
Obviously there's no concern for the people are actually using these drugs

647
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,256
Or you wouldn't find people selling

648
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:41,376
Fentanyl analogues that site potent fentanyl as in the synthetic opioid

649
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,192
And it's followed pretty much the same path as

650
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
Synthetic cannabinoids

651
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,776
Fentanyl started out as a legitimate medicine

652
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,592
But black market chemists figured out how to make it

653
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
Then figured out how to make

654
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Even more potent

655
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
And now

656
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
It's killing tens of thousands

657
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,784
It's part of the same synthetic drug Revolution

658
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,344
Ushered in by JW HOA

659
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:06,208
It's now been nearly 30 years since John Hoffman created jwa

660
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Pho 88

661
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,840
And he told us For Better or Worse people now associate him with synthetic cannabinoid

662
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,400
He's gotten a strange array of emails

663
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,776
Sometimes people write and ask him for advice on how to cook their own synthetic

664
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,104
But sometimes these emails are from parents

665
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
In Grand Prairie

666
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
They say

667
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
These drugs are causing psychosis

668
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
In my kids

669
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Immigrant

670
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
And they blame John

671
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,344
You know you've ruined my life you ruined my

672
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,904
Kid's life etc etc that kind of thing

673
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,440
That's not a very fun

674
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Email

675
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
To get

676
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,280
No they're not but they're not enjoyable

677
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,352
And I feel sorry for them

678
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,912
But it is my fault

679
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,008
John says what else was he supposed to do

680
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
Scientists publish their science

681
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,152
How could he have anticipated that one compound from his research

682
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,432
What help jump-start

683
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
The global synthetic

684
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,736
Drug Revolution

685
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:07,136
The drug epidemic is a story

686
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,928
Much larger than 1/2

687
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
85 minutes

688
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,512
We would love to hear your ideas about how to cover it
