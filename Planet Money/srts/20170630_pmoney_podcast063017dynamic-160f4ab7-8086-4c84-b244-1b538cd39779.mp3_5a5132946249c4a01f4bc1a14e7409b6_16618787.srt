Hated spending money

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,344

The food to see how much it would cost to have a wife

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
Came with this Legend

23
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,808
The legend was that

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,392
He died alone and there had to be money buried here somewhere

25
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,696
NCG is Dan's family tried to find it

26
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,792
There is actually spots in the basement here where my grandfather tried to

27
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,096
Bus stop the concrete to find money

28
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
Use a sledgehammer

29
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Didn't find it

30
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,424
At one point

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,240
Then himself got a metal detector as a birthday present

32
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
He didn't find anything either

33
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,360
I mean years later dad was knocking down this hundred-year-old chicken coop

34
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
Out in the yard

35
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,688
And low and behold

36
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,992
Take apart this one wall and

37
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
I

38
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,832
Didn't think anything of it at turned around with my skid loader came back

39
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,904
And I saw a box tipped over with a bunch of

40
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
Pieces of paper on the ground

41
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
And it

42
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,256
The first thing I pop my head was

But

52
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:04,160
Lot of it was rotted and moisture eating away at it molded

53
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,256
And some of it was just so degraded you couldn't even tell

55
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328

Lots of life

And sitting at this desk

106
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024

00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Currency

108
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,887
About eight of them are going through packages of messed up money

109
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Peace pipe

110
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935

00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Tell me about what

113
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
What is this

114
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,823
Kansas actually burn

115
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Burned in house fire

116
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,199
$100,000 is $100,000

117
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,575
Did it this is this box is just a priority mail box here is this priority mail box with the money came in

118
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,903
$100,000 in a priority mail box

119
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
Kolento the money also looks like it got wet

120
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
Probably when the firemen put out the

121
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
So and you have pierced

122
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,679
You can barely tell right it's just like black

123
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
Ashley

124
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,055
I just where I don't even know where I saw the hunter on this bill you can't see it at all

125
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
But they're just in the corner you can see a hundred

126
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
Back together and

127
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
A Black Talon

128
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,807
Brick looking at them you just have no idea we would start to workout

129
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,135
I'm visiting the office I was expecting some kind of

130
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
High-tech answer to this question

131
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,767
A polarized light microscope kind of laser

132
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,607
Spectrometer I get thinking spectrometer exactly

133
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,935
So what color cancels out to work through this this brick is

134
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:32,031
Looks like a chisel could be made in 1850

135
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
It's just like a metal

136
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
On the front with a wood handle

137
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
And he actually

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
Uses the handle he takes the wooden handle

139
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
And starts rolling it back and forth with his palm over the

140
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
It's actually off

141
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,391
Rolling in actually make the Tennessee Loose

142
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,255
You really made it so birds that like as you're rolling black

143
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,839
Ashes coming off of it like the money is a disintegrating

144
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
But it's not

145
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Old

146
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,959
Like this break is loosening up in the end of

147
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
Virtual Bill Fay I coming apart

148
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:08,127
And almost all of those bills you can start to make out like a little bit on the right hand side

149
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,455
So he cuts off the right hand side of the bills

150
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
Any paper clips

151
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,087
By the way for your money to count as as good money

152
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,671
You need to either sending more than 50% of a bill

153
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,487
Or if you send in less than 50%

154
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,583
You need to convince the examiner that the rest of the bill was completely destroyed

155
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,399
Zocaloans just going to count Applebee's Friday

156
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,799
Doolittle paperwork and the person who sent in the bed money they will get reimbursed for the value of every bill but kehlani

157
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
So what's going on in this room is is

158
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
Amazing

159
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,687
It's it's actually a free service provided by the

160
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,503
And you can either say wow that's great thanks government

161
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
Where you could say

162
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,367
Wait if somebody has $100,000 in their house

163
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
And their house burns down

164
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,231
Like why should I as a taxpayer

165
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
Hate government workers

166
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
Soar through the money I mean

167
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
Keep your money in a bank

168
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
If you don't want it to burn down in

169
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
So we have to about this

170
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,263
And they told us basically look Congress asked us to start doing

171
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
It's a long time ago

172
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
They give us the money to do it every year

173
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
So we do it

174
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
And look it's a public service

175
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
You could also say the dollar

176
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
The literal dollar bill

177
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Lindsey Pizza

178
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,135
Paper it's an IOU from the US

179
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
MS Office is a way of showing the world like

180
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
But the government stand behind the

181
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,327
We will be there when bad things happen to good bills

182
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,399
And by we the government means the people in this room

183
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
We go to the desk next to Cologne

184
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
Bullmastiff

185
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,031
This money back here it just like if I saw it

186
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,895
I wouldn't even know his money I would just think like it's some I'm going to have to scrape off of my shoe

187
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,479
That's a different case because it's wet

188
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,575
Fan on it so I can dried up and about the size of

189
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
I don't even know what is high tech solution for what you doing where Monday red

190
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Over another examiner is like

191
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
Tasted up a little

192
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Someone sent in with their money

193
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,911
I've been close mutilated currency in the amount of $20,000

194
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,703
1000 $20 bills

195
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
To the break-ins

196
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
I in in my neighborhood

197
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,383
I took the precaution and hit the cash in our backyard

198
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
The currency was placed in a plastic bag

199
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,783
I retrieved the currency a few days ago and found out they have been mutilated

200
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
Rain and flooding in our backyard

201
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
Had caused the currency to be mutilate

202
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
$20,000

203
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
And it's a mess

204
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,047
The Examiner going through this money is gal free

205
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,351
GAO April knockout

206
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
When's that get bees telling us his name the next

207
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,263
We just cut the corner of $20 bills

208
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
That makes me nervous.

209
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,199
And then he's like slowly prying apart every single bill in the sky

210
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
We have to identify each node

211
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,807
Because sometime

212
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
Did knows I'm Midway conquer face

213
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,975
So so some of them are real but they might sneak a few counter sealer

214
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
Right

215
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
But of my voice belongs to Lydia washing

216
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,423
She's depressed person for this off

217
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
And she said they don't talk about counterfeit currency

218
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,591
The review of the times that we asked about Shady circumstances stuff

219
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
Come through the office

220
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
She shut us down every time

221
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
I mean

222
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,783
Come on right you have you have people sending in

223
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
$100,000 in cash

224
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
In Priority Mail Boxes

225
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,439
Mysteriously destroyed in a fire

226
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
Obviously there is going to be some sketchy Behavior here

227
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,399
They wouldn't talk about it at the office

228
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
Fortunately for us

229
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Once in a while it does

230
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
Pop out into the public record

231
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
A cool s you actually found this one case that went to court

232
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
A few years ago

233
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
United States of America

234
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,479
Versus phone

235
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,783
245000

236
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,087
$800 in mutilated

237
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Currency

238
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,951
The full force of the United States government is going

239
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Court to sue

240
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,535
A pile of burned up

241
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
P******

242
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,583
Waterlogged

243
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
Because that is what prosecutors do when they want to

244
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Feel something

245
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Basu

246
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
The thing

247
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,847
In this particular case a bank in Argentina with sending millions of mutilated.

248
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,919
That people do use American dollars a lot

249
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
But

250
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,783
The examiners in this room still thought something suspicious

251
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
So they passed the case to Federal

252
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Who agreed

253
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
They thought maybe it was money laundering

254
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Was criminal activity till it went to court

255
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,559
It was $200,000 worth of bills with two pots

256
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
The same bill was sending an indifferent

257
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
Right and the government sees that 200000

258
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,311
Sorry random kid from third grade your scheme to double your money didn't I

259
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,943
The other four million dollars they're like most of that money it went back to that bank in Argentina

260
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,247
Cases from this office do not wind up in

261
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Pink Floyd Vera

262
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,599
And a lot of them do seem just like honest

263
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,719
For example one of the examiner's Sharon Williams she told us about a case that she got lost

264
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,791
Is a man with Alzheimer's who put his life savings

265
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,119
Shredder $350,000

266
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Shred

267
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
Missing pieces

268
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
A lot of pee

269
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,359
It's literally been put through a machine that's supposed to make it impossible to put it back together

270
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
And your job is to put it back together

271
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
Who is this

272
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
And my heart goes out for

273
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,295
For the people

274
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,135
Chin specializes in cases where she has to put torn-up money back

275
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
I love it because I like

276
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
Doing puzzles

277
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
When we meet her she's going through

278
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
Clear plastic bag of pulling up bills

279
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
She said the DC Subway

280
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
The bills going to get toned going into the ticket machines and stuff

281
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
Safeway

282
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
My hair might have to go

283
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
Michaels here

284
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,871
Adam Ant

285
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,735
Before we left we talked to Eric Walsh he's the manager he up he's worked in the office for 13 years

286
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
Give us some of the greatest

287
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
We had a farmer who

288
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Coweta's wallet

289
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,695
We always encouraged mail it in its original package

290
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,303
He actually shipped in the cow's stomach containing the wallet so

291
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
What would happen to the cow

292
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
The cow did not make it

293
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
I thought the cows had.

294
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,263
We allowed animals return season of sometimes they're actually

295
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
Process through the system B

296
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
Before we get down we by which you mean

297
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
Animal poop with money in it

298
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,455
They do

299
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
We do return those and have them

300
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
Please wash them off before they send it to us but

301
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,367
Refused Return to Sender

302
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
What's the most money anybody ever sent

303
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,511
Attempted armored car robbery where l

304
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,863
They attempted to blow off the back doors of the car and

305
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679
It incinerated about 2 million dollars inside

306
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
2 Millions the most with the least

307
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
Dollar

308
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
$1 in dollars

309
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
News you can use

310
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,383
If your money gets wet do not put it in the microwave

311
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,711
There's a little metallic in the strips and it will burst into flames

312
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
If I microwave my money I'll burst into flames

313
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
South

314
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
Please don't

315
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,647
That totally makes me want to put money in the microwave

316
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
1 lakh

317
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Piece of advice

318
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
Please include your name and address when

319
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
No

320
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,167
Baby surprised how many cases we get where there is no correspondence or no nothing and

321
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,983
Unfortunately we can't send out a check unless

322
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Let me know who that money

323
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,799
He's going to send you

324
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,127
Whatever $1,000 and they won't put a return address

325
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
And that was it we left not long after that

326
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
But what about

327
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Fandemic

328
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
What about that

329
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,647
Box of mutilated money he pulled out of the chicken

330
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
They gave me a receipt

331
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
It said

332
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
Silver box with

333
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,607
Mutilated currency amount not known

334
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,631
It says on the receipt

335
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
Okay and then what

336
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,031
It was probably almost exactly a year later

337
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
I got a letter from the bank

338
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
And it went into my account

339
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
3300

340
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Some dollars

341
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
I thought

342
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,831
I was hoping it would be more I was a little disappointed

343
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
So what

344
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
You know it's always good to get money I was

345
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
It was happy but still

346
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,071
Back in the thirties when Walt Mallory first Berry that Ma

347
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
You could buy a house

348
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,191
Windance Grandparents were living in the house in the

349
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
You could buy a new car

350
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Then told us

351
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
You actually kind of wishes

352
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
His grandparents had found

353
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,871
It would have been worth so much more

354
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:46,527
What you do with it what you do with the money the money I put I already owed money on the new shed I was building so it was already spent

355
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
Cool s you have one last

356
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
Amazing little anecdote about

357
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
The mutilated coin
