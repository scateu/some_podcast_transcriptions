But lots of people

10
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,272
Don't know where they come from

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,952
Joyce Farms the Walmart's number

12
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,000
We're looking at thousands of

13
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,280
These little rapper lollipop

14
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,304
Clattering out

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
Is Big steel pipe

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,864
@the dum dum Factory

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,264
Northwest Ohio

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:48,640
Jean Spangler is the former CEO of the Spangler

19
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,968
And he's showing us around the kitchen at The Candy Factory

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,016
It's a little bit Willy Wonka

21
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,320
Imagine kitchen Mead for giant

22
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:00,416
With a couple of busy little chefs running around in aprons and hairnets

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,744
Where did Metals metal detector reporting these big

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,768
Eel pots

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,048
Sticky sugar in

26
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,656
Corn syrup into this Kitchen Aid that is as tall as a basketball hoop

27
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
And there's what looks like Pete buckets

28
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
Just standing right next

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,336
The buckets are filled with flavors and colors

30
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
Is blueberry

31
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,920
Cream soda root beer watermelon

32
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
Dum Dums is the signature product of

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,272
The Spangler candy company

34
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,344
The factory is several football fields big

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,160
We need a whole separate building just for the ingredients

36
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
What ingredient in particular

37
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,768
Muse about a hundred thousand pounds of sugar a day

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,096
Where's the sugar in the Sugar Shack

39
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
The room is basically big enough for for huge tanks

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
Of liquid sugar Olympic-sized swimming

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
We have about enough

42
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
Trigger storage here

43
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
For about 4 days

44
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
So we're receiving sugar

45
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,176
No contest

46
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,272
All year long all day long 24 hours a day

47
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,624
Lots of places replace sugar with corn syrup

48
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
And there's corn syrup in these lollipops to

49
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,768
But Dean says to get the true flavor of your childhood

50
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
There is

51
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
Nothing

52
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
Delivers

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
Flavor

54
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
Like sugar

55
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
That's a that's a real

56
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,056
Could we make a dumb dumb with a pure corn sweetener

57
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Probably

58
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,432
Would it make the same emotional connection with you

59
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
No definitely would

60
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
It's the sugar that.

61
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,368
Sugar is the the sugar as the deliverer of the flavor

62
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,952
The Spengler company they actually make this other iconic

63
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,304
To Candy something even more Nostalgia inspiring than a lollipop

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
Red and white

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Candy canes

66
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,680
They used to make them here at this Factory in Ohio

67
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,216
About 10 years ago

68
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
They moved the red and white candy

69
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Operation

70
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
To Mexico

71
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
It had gotten too expensive to make

72
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,736
I'm here the places that buy the candy canes to sell the Targets in the Walmarts of the world they don't care about the brain

73
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,296
They don't care where they come from they want them cheap

74
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Candy canes are treated like

75
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
Commodity by the big box stores

76
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
Completely the red lights

77
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,744
And when you go to the big box retailers of the world

78
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
They leave

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
4 quarter percent

80
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
I can't I have a son of Cain

81
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
I mean

82
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
They're going to the lowest price

83
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
So this story so far

84
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
Factory moving its operations from

85
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,592
Ohio to Mexico where can I bring more cheaply

86
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,408
That's a typical story you might think you know the real

87
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
But Kirk faccia

88
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
The currency of the singer

89
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,552
He's pretty sure you don't know the way

90
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
In fact

91
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,904
Recently he's giving a talk at the Kiwanis Club in town

92
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
Kind of like a rotary cup

93
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
And he explained

94
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
He could expand his operation

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
In a huge way right here in Ohio

96
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,144
Not send any candy canes to my

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
At all

98
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
I said I just need one thing

99
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
People get excited and then

100
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,848
I asked him to guess what's the one thing that you need and people guess

101
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
In all kinds of things up

102
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
A lower tax rates in

103
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,040
How about workers comp reform and let's get rid of OSHA

104
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:12,416
And let's repeal that food safety modernization act or pass the right to work law

105
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,976
Or let's get some government development

106
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
This is some of the things I guess

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Amongst other things

108
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
I said no it's not

109
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
Any of those

110
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
In fact it's not all of those put together

111
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
If I paid 0 taxes and got all those other things

112
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
Don't even matter

113
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
It's not as important as the one thing

114
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,639
That I need

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
And people are still guessing what it is and I said

116
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
Lettuce by sugar

117
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
On the free market

118
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
And there's the silence

119
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,695
Animals kind of collective

120
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
Why can't you do that

121
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
And then I say it's a story

122
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
And I'm about to tell it to you

123
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm so itchy

125
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,623
An adventure together working on this server

126
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,743
Yes definitely Kirk fashion story the story of a lot of American candy

127
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,815
It may not be exactly the story that

128
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
Kirkwood Hotel

129
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,423
But it takes us from a candy company in Bryan Ohio

130
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,031
Out to the sugar beet fields of Baden Minnesota with stops in Washington DC

131
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,623

Before we Dive In

139
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,919
Here's the most important thing you have to know to get in

140
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Into the story

141
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,967
There are two price

142
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
For sugar

143
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
The price you pay when you're in the United States

144
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,855
And the price you pay almost everywhere else in the world

145
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
On average

146
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
Over the last decade

147
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,463
The price you pay in the United States

148
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,303
It's about $0.15 more than you pay outside the country

149
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,375
15 cents more per pound of sugar

150
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,727
$0.15 extra per pound of sugar if you're in the business of making candy

151
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Adds up to a lot of money

152
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
Reason

153
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
100000 lb

154
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:38,847
A day

155
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,663
That's $15,000 a day

156
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
That's $75,000 a week

157
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,551
Multiply that by 52 weeks

158
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
It's three to four million dollars

159
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,647
Three to four million dollars a year

160
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
That's what these guys called

161
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
The sugar path

162
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Now

163
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Who would do that

164
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Who would impose

165
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
Disorderly random tax

166
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
On us candy

167
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
US Congress

168
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727

170
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,055
Is better known as the US Farm Bill

171
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,639
I'm going to read this one part that this whole story is really about

172
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,175
Subtitle d

173
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967

6 Sugar program subsection B sugar

175
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,111
It says that the US government will guarantee

176
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,647
Minimum price for sugar

177
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
That is not to drop below

178
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
22.9 cents

179
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Per pound

180
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
End

Quote

182
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
That's

183
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,631
The guarantee

184
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
No matter how low the price goes in the rest

185
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Of the world

In the United States

You will be paying

188

At least

189
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
22

190
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
.9 sense

191
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Purple

192
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
Insomnia

193
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
These guys

194
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,319
We're driving into the field we're going to plant sugar beets in 2013

195
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:55,135
And the snow is only about 3 in deep

196
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
At the moment right here

197
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,767
Just like a Barren Wasteland

198
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Blaine Benedict

199
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
He's a sugar beet farmer here in Stephen Minnesota

200
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
And he runs a farm with his two brothers

201
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
Farms in this part of the

202
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,799
Country were settled in the

203
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
1870s

204
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
And

205
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,479
Our family has been farming here since late 1870s

206
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
Blaine and his brothers

207
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
4th generation and it is just

208
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
Back out here

209
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Farmland as far as

210
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,719
You can see it's a long way out to the horizon

211
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,815
The clouds are low in grave supposed to snow later this afternoon

212
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
Can you hear the birds

213
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
Even though the ground is still totally White

214
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
It's a hard conversation

215
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
Someone's 4th generation farm and say

216
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
Why do you get the special treatment

217
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
Why do you deserve

218
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,503
Special line written in a bell that guarantees a minimum price for your product

219
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
We go around and around on it

220
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
The answer we land on is

221
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,623
Because all our

222
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,439
Foreign competitors are getting special protection to

223
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
There's government involved

224
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
In most developed countries

225
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
At some level of

226
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
Or another with

227
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
With a price

228
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
On sugar

229
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
The US sugar guys say

230
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Just look at Brazil

231
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
The Brazilian government

232
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,895
Couple billion dollars in subsidies to their sugar industry

233
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,015
They say the Mexican Government actually owns most of its factories that make sugar

234
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:31,391
God biggest fear is that we're all in a fair playing in a competitive

235
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Field

236
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
You know when

237
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,743
If you're competing against

238
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Other

239
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
Government policies in Ohio in

240
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
I mean that's

241
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
That's what makes us nervous is it

242
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
It's a very common

243
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
Rationalization

244
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,591
You know the other kids are doing it or that other guy's a bully or

245
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Something

246
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:57,503
Daniel Sumner is Economist at UC Davis in the early 90s he worked at the USDA setting us Farm policy

247
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:03,647
He says the problem with this argument is there is already a solution to unfair trade

248
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,023
A solution that does not involve enshrining a price guarantee into the law

249
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
On sugar there's a very specific

250
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Remedy here

251
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
Whip something

252
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
Cold

253
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
Countervailing Duty law

254
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
States

255
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
It works like this

256
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,519
If you're an industry

257
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,639
And you think another country is unfairly subsidizing something we buy from them

258
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
There's a solution

259
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
You complain to the World Trade Organization

260
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
The US slaps a tariff

261
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
Or a tax on that import

262
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
It's bigger than the subsidy amount

263
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
And that's the way

264
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
To even the playing

265
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,535
A lot of people told us there is this really big reason

266
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,351
That sugar has a price guarantee embedded in the law

267
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:49,215
And this reason has nothing to do with Brazil or the WTO or

268
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
Actually economic

269
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,287
Do I just tell that

270
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
He's the store now

271
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Back at The Candy Factory

272
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,383
Kirk Bashaw says

273
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,711
Here's a story that will really explain the US sugar policy

274
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
You got the Ken Starr report that

275
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,391
Careful readers of that report will notice

276
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
That

277
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
There was somebody who

278
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,351
Call President Clinton while he was in the Oval Office with Monica Lewinsky

279
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
And president

280
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
Took this person's phone call

281
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
22 minutes I think it was

282
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
Monica wasn't very happy

283
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,151
Is that the president was taking a person's phone call

284
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,527
Wells part of the investigation made to corroborate her story they want to look at the White House Records

285
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
And sure enough it was one of the

286
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
That this sugar tycoons is not calling

287
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,743
Had called that President Clinton had that conversation

288
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,303
That's the definition of having too much

289
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,399
Political power when you can call the president of the United States

290
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,215
When he's in the Oval Office with his mistress

291
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
And you take his phone call

292
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
That's too much political

293
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
We look this up in the star report and apparently this called came in while Clinton was trying to end things

294
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
With Monica

295
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
But the cigar incident was yet

296
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
But back to the sugar story

297
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
The sugar Lobby

298
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
It is really powerful

299
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
Super well-organized

300
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Each year

301
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
It gives a lot of money

302
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
Political campaigns

303
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,143
And it spends a lot lobbying for or against Bill

304
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:28,799
Last year the sugar industry spent almost four times what the wheat soy bean and corn industry spent

305
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Combined

306
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,919
And it's been almost double what the food and beverage industry spent as a whole

307
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
A big chunk of that money goes to people like

308
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,039
This guy US Representative

309
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
Collin Peterson he is a Democrat from Minnesota

310
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Until recently

311
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,951
He was cheer of the agriculture Committee in the house

312
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
I've been called a communist before

313
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
I'm okay with that

314
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,303
That's because

315
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,447
Collin Peterson is a big advocate of the central planning of the sugar supply in the guaranteed minimum price

316
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,103
We asked him if the reason he's such a champion of the sugar program is that the sugar companies like them

317
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
American Crystal

318
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
Are the biggest contributors to his campaign

319
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,015
If American Crystal gave me zero I would take the same position

320
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
Really any difference

321
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,415
Well well because this is 25% of the economy in my district

322
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
You think I'm not going to fight for this

323
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Ghetto

324
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
I mean it has nothing to do with

325
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
How much money made

326
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
They support me because I support them

327
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,751
Which comes first the chicken or the egg

328
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:39,455
Back in Stephen Minnesota instantly Collin Peterson's Hometown his dad farmed

329
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,527
Potatoes out here in sold the land to sugar be

330
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Beet farmer

331
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
His constituents here in Minnesota

332
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
They agree with him

333
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:53,023
Crowbar is in the middle of nowhere it's a dive in the shadow of a grain elevator

334
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,423
And everyone here can tell you stories about Farmers driving around and Shining trucks are made

335
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,703
Checks from the government

336
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
But if you press them

337
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Bill say

338
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
Nobody out here once anything to change

339
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,895
I talked to Chris Lang and Judy Hanson over beer

340
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,455
They love the system the way it is

341
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,271
In fact in October during the Harvest

342
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
When sugar beet Farmers start turning sugar beets

343
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Into sugar

344
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:24,255
There's a bad smell in the air but it's the smell of money

345
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:36,799
Shoes on kids feet smells like we're building stuff

346
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,127
If you eliminate the sugar program

347
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
Again Congressman Collin Peterson

348
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,759
What will happen is we will not grow sugar in the United States

349
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
And why is it such a bad thing

350
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
Because it's it's a

351
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,951
Huge economic activity in many parts of this country that

352
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,743
Help me create a lot of jobs

353
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
And a lot of economic activity

354
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
You know everybody wants the government

355
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
The fix

356
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
You know the crate job

357
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,703
Let me do these polls the government

358
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Not doing enough

359
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
The great job

360
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
And the water area that through this recession

361
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
The old one area that's worth

362
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,455
That's actually been successful and is actually

363
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,783
Maintain that increase jobs has been agriculture

364
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,575
Cancel the people

365
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
The claim that they want us to

366
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
Did the government to improve

367
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
The economy

368
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,743
Are going after sugar and Dairy

369
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
And crop insurance and every other

370
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Aspect of the

371
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
Of the farm sector

372
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
They're trying to screw up the one thing that's actually working

373
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,751
The other side of this

374
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
The candy manufacturers

375
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,335
They make the same argument

376
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
Justin reverse

377
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
Peterson says

378
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Jobs might be lost

379
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
The candy guy say

380
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,247
Jobs that might otherwise have been

381
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
Created

382
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Weren't

383
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,903
That's what's so strange about this whole thing we're not so different you and I are both these

384
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
Classic American Industries

385
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
Minnesota farming

386
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
Ohio Manufacturing

387
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,583
In Minnesota there's four generations of farmers Farm

388
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
But in Ohio

389
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,935
Those guys are 4th generation 2

390
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,263
The Spangler Factory has been around since 1906

391
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
Always run by A Spangler

392
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,871
The fifth generation of spangler's worked as an intern

393
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
In the factory this year

394
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
And both guys meet

395
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,503
The same argument that their Industries are a multi

396
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,599
Supplier the candymaker's say what about the guys who Supply the wrapping paper

397
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
Paper for the Dum Dum

398
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
The lollipop

399
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
What about the sugar beet truck driver

400
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
The Tractor Sales

401
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
What will happen to them

402
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
If farming goes overseas

403
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,375
Is there a way the government can come up with the most

404
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
Beer policy

405
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
To both of these quintessential American industry

406
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,751
Farming and manufacture

407
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,871
And we ask the guy who's in charge of the sugar program here in the United

408
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
States that sugar commissar

409
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,991
Chief Economist at the USDA itself doctor

410
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,575
Joe glauber how do you arbitrate with sphere

411
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
Well

412
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:04,255
Never asked her in the comments about what's fair or not I mean I ate there you know it's a highly regulated market

413
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,327
And you know generally I think as an economist

414
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
You know I certainly would prefer a free market

415
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:16,543
Joe glauber is the guy whose job it is to manage the sugar supply in this country in order to keep up the price of pork

416
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
He's basically saying

417
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
His job should not exist

418
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
The government's really his

419
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711
Hands should be off the wheel

420
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:28,831
But in this case this is something we're Congress feels that Sugar producers should be

421
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
Protected

422
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,647
From the world market

423
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,463
Congress continues to address the question of sugar

424
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
They're competing Bells

425
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:41,119
One on the Candy Maker side a sugar of Farmville that tries to dismantle a lot of the sugar program

426
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,191
That's a bill that shows up pretty regularly on the hill

427
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
And it's never pass

428
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,287
Of course there's also a new farm bill that will just

429
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,335
Extend the sugar program we have now

430
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
It's expected

431
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
And if it does

432
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
It means

433
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,991
We will continue to get our candy canes from Mexico

434
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
No sugar from Minnesota

435
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,863

Hey it's just back here in present day

447
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,351
Since we ran the show originally

448
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,167
That farm bill passed in 2014

449
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,239
It left the sugar subsidies pretty much the same

450
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:55,103
We text back in with a kindness Daniel Sumner and he said those sugar reform bills

451
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
Also went nowhere

452
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,967
Things have gotten a little more complicated but really nothing

453
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
Exchanged of any substance

454
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
And I credit

455
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
For that

456
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,879
A remarkable job done by the sugar Lobby

457
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,535
But with all this talk these past few weeks around protecting American industry from foreign competition

458
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,095
Steel and aluminum tariffs in the news

459
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Daniel says

460
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,959
He's hearing a bunch of politicians who are usually harsh on trade

461
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
Changing their tune

462
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,799
Interestingly enough those tend to be

463
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
Politically

464
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,103
Anti Trump

465
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,199
It's always possible we can put together a coalition

466
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
Of people who are frustrated with mister

467
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
Trump

468
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,087
Actually change them

469
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
About sugar policy

470
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
Dino Peds

471
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,999
Optimistic but doesn't see change happening anytime soon

472
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,839
We also check back in with Spangler the candymaker's

473
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:53,727
They said they are still turning out those Dum Dum lollipops in the US and candy canes in Mexico

474
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
And that

475
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:58,591
Fifth generation family member who's an intern back in 2013

476
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
She's not working for the company right now

477
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:06,527
They have this rule family members have to work somewhere else before going full-time at Spangler

478
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
But they tell us

479
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,111
She may be back someday

480
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:18,559
