A few weeks ago reporter Sally Hershey

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,608
Steps decided to run an informal economic

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,960
So who Am I who am I talking to you introduce yourself in 10 years old

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,728
Estimator

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,496
10 years old

6
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,264
She was with her friend

7
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,312
I'm caffeine I'm 10 years old

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,640
Here we go Sally put a box on the table

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:22,784
It was

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
A cake

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,088
It wasn't intentionally a lab

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,112
There was like

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,672
A section with a pile of marshmallows another section with

14
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952
Gummy bears

15
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,256
Another sex with a pile of Skittles

16
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:38,400
A pastry in the middle I know that it is a cannoli the cannoli

17
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,936
We have to figure out

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
How to fairly divide

19
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,800
Cake this is an actual academic

20
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,336
Problem there is a hole

21
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,384
Genre of literature dedicated to the

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,408
The cake cutting

23
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
Problem

24
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,248
This is a surprisingly complicated problem

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,808
The cake is all these different parts and the girls have

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
Really different taste

27
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,672
How do you both feel about the marshmallow marshmallow

28
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,536
But they do make different flavors if you combine them what we many mathematician

29
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
Thought about this for years

30
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
And there is

31
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
A solution

32
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Called

33
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Or if your kid it's called

34
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
I cut

35
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
U-Pick

36
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,592
One person cuts it and the other person decide who gets what

37
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,128
They could be equal

38
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
I think

39
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
That works

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,528
Too because I'm going to want to cut them equally so that then at least we at least

41
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
I don't get a tiny piece when she gets a big kid hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Kenny Malone

And their Solutions we will tell you how to

44
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,752
Fairly split the rent between roommates how to take a movie when you're in a group of people with strong opinions and we go

45
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
Go to California

46
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:52,384
We're one of the most complicated Fair division problems we've ever seen

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Exists

48
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
It is a mess

62
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
You see examples of these

63
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
All the time

64
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
Take your morning commute

65
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
Maybe your Highway has an express lane

66
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
Yeah how do you decide which

67
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
Stripers get to use it

68
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,632
Should you only allow carpoolers or

69
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
People be allowed to

70
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,240
To pay to bypass traffic even think about a swimming pool

71
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,568
Should there be a special Adult Swim should some Lanes

72
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,896
Be dedicated just for swimming laps

73
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,224
One guy is always this guy in a little

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992

Blue plastic cargo rooting for everybody

77
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
Right

78
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Anyway

79
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
These are all resources

80
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
With someone

81
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,488
Needs to cut and divide

82
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,792
In the whole reason we got interested in Fair division is

83
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
Is because of this mess we heard about

84
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
In Santa Barbara California

85
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
So I headed there to check it out

86
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
Is this refund mccrummen

00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,224
Nick

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,088
Oh my God it's so beautiful no one told me California

92
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,672
So pretty and beautiful

93
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
We can ask

94
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
Look out at the water here

95
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,376
On one side mountains and palm trees on the other

96
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Folks

97
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,912
Sailboat

98
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
Commercial fishing boat

99
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Yacht

100
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,032
This big white boat over here Sally

101
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
What's a catamaran

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Don't look super fancy

103
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Is super big

104
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,736

Bethesda

106
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
The Crosby used to keep a boat here

107
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:12,672
Kevin Costner and Kathy Ireland husband still do and here is the problem Santa Barbara has run

108
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,024
Over the last 30 years it has become a destination for the rich

109
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
And Famous

110
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
Famous people love

111
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
Really big boats

112
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,703
Troup head so the harbor has run into this classic dilemma

113
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
It needs to parcel out these limited space

114
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
At the public Harbor

115
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
So that everyone

116
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
From a fisherman to a billionaire

117
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
Could have a shot at getting one of these spots

118
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
Very quickly

119
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
Demand for places to keep a boat

120
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Got out of hand

121
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
The waiting list for a boat slip

122
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,647
Which is a parking space for a boat

123
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,927
Was so long

124
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Get ready for it

125
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
You could be waiting to

126
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
100 years for a spot

127
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,351
However there was this one

128
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Loophole

129
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
You could by somebody else

130
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Boat

131
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,727
It is part of that transaction

132
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
They could transfer the rights

133
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
They're like boat

134
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Parking Spot 2

135
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
And so

136
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
This Market Spring

137
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
You overpay for somebody's boat

138
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,295
You get their spot on the dock and you don't have to worry about that giant waiting

139
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
It's like buying somebody's crap

140
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
EPPICard to get there

141
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,719
And as soon as you have something increasing in value and a way to train it

142
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,255
You get speculators

143
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,095
Because back in the day back in 1999 or 2000

144
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,935
A lot of people they were buying boats and getting slip permits

145
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
As Investments

146
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
Except of course the city owns all those

147
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Stock spots

148
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,615
So investors weren't buying real estate they were just

149
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
Paying for the right to park their boats there

150
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
And then hoping they could sell those rights

151
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
To make a profit

152
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
I just got so high people were

153
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,415
Grant but it was this one rule speculators had to abide by

154
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
You can just get it

155
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,255
Permit leave it empty and let its value

156
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
You had to have a boat there

157
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Any boat

158
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
We're people just

159
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Buying

160
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
Like some sort of

161
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Crappy old boat

162
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Parking

163
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Yep

164
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,311
Yep to sit on to sit on the investor

165
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,383
Oh absolutely

166
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,711
Basically I wouldn't stick that was 60 feet long

167
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
A stick no basically

168
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
A log with some you know

169
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
I mean

170
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,879
I'm exaggerating but not by much

171
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Just a

172
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,999
Yeah okay log marries a canoe

173
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:29,119
And and their offspring is what I'm talking of it was clear to mix

174
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,191
That his Harbors way of giving up these spots

175
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Was not working

176
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,751
They just completely out of whack

177
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
This whole mess at the harbor is an example of

178
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
Fair division at its

179
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Very worse

180
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,175
And this was how we got fascinated

181
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
With the world of fair division problem

182
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
We figured

183
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,551
Certainly there must be someone who

184
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
Studies all the different ways

185
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
Harbors or cities

186
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
Or cake loving people

187
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
Can split stuff up

188
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,231
And of course

189
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
There was

190
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
Should I start now

191
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,631
How to hire Constantino's

192
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,727
Said that's colitis and a professor of computer science at MIT

193
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
What are your colleagues call you

194
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
ICarly cast

195
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
Kostas is an expert in game

196
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,431
And he says of course not every Fair division problem

197
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
Is as simple as dividing a

198
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
Yeah like what about things you

199
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
You Can't Touch This

200
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
What happens when money gets

201
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
What about when there are more than

202
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Will trying to share

203
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,767
Socastee is going to walk us through a range of fair division

204
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
Spring start

205
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Which one of the most

206
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
Practically

207
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Something called

208
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
The rental Harmony problem

209
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,495
And man I wish I knew about this one in my 20s

210
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
This is a solution for 8

211
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,103
Perplexing issue many of us face sometimes in our lives

212
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,895
How to fairly split the rent

213
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
Between roommates

214
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
Kirsty says imagine that you got an apartment

215
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
With two

216
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
One of those bedrooms

217
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
What is big

218
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
But it has no closet

219
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,439
The other is small but it does have that magical closet space

220
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,231
That's right and how you split the rent

221
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:05,887
I maybe you know I value a small room that has a closet but usually more a big room that because you like space

222
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
I'm taking the closet

223
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,191
Yeah I don't need the closet

224
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,847
I wear the same jeans everyday for 2 weeks in a row

225
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:21,247
So like you know who gets what what's the location but also how is the rent split

226
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,039
So what is the protocol

227
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
Cuz he says well

228
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
What's in the rent is

229
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
2000 bucks

230
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
First thing

231
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,743
Everybody needs to figure out what percentage of the rent

232
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
The stink

233
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Each room

234
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Me before you

235
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
Dudum Seroquel

236
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
The word for kidney

237
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,799
Big space is so much more valuable that he says looking I don't care about the clothes that I don't even have clothes okay

238
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
So what I can about this case

239
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,431
So at some point

240
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
Close

241
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,343
So the protocol that we use my roommate was the classical one

242
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
These are the two domains in a sealed envelope

243
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
Wright's what they consider to be the right split what would be the right values of the two rooms

244
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
She did that

245
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,351
We did.

246
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,167
If he also Affair division guy your roommate

247
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,495
Also a mathematician

248
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,055
Not going to get together and we opened doesn't

249
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,103
And when they open those envelopes

250
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
They found out

251
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
Hey Kristie says roommate

252
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,991
Thought the person with the big room should pay $1,400

253
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
And the person with the smaller room

254
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
With the closet

255
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
Should pay 600

256
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
The coasties

257
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,487
He valued both those rooms equally he was willing to pay $1,000

258
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:40,351
For either room and in case you haven't been following along with a calculator each roommates

259
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
Total bed for both rooms

260
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
Have to add up to

261
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
$2,000

262
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Provided the big room

263
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
Morganite value

264
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,359
Yeah

265
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
Were there the highest

266
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,711
Be there

267
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,039
How much do we pay we pay the average tattoo prices

268
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
I'm so happy

269
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,927
Que said 1400 I said a thousand so he can get it but he placed 100

270
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,231
Circus copyright space

271
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,511
800 for the small room

272
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,535
And he's happy

273
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
Because he

274
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
He was willing to pay

275
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
Everybody's happy now

276
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,703
Live with mathematicians

277
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,055
Are you are you free tonight because I feel like next time my boyfriend and I decide

278
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,895
Who gets to pick what movie to watch I would like you to be part of it

279
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
And this gets to our next

280
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
Tear of

281
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Classic Fair division

282
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Problems

283
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
What's a year with a friend

284
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,599
It's Friday night

285
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
You cannot agree

286
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
What you should do

287
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
Kenny I know what you're going to say you want to bake a cake

288
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,303
I wish I could bake a cake what I actually would like to do

289
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,399
Is watch The Great British Bake Off have you seen that oh my God yes every

290
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Single-season multiple times

291
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
I'm embarrassed to say how many

292
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
4 years behind on this

293
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Kind of end

294
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,639
Sorry Kenny I really do really do not want to watch that again

295
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,687
What I would like to watch the

296
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:03,807
You asked is this awesome new nature series from David Attenborough and the BBC is called dynasties

297
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
Work Tennessee's if you're British and it

298
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,671
It's awesome I don't care how it's pronounced I want to watch baking

299
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
And here we are turning

300
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,767
Luckily Fair division has a solution for this

301
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
Random

302
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Assignment

303
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
AKA

304
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,631
Coin flipping no course

305
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
We all know about coins

306
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Nothing but

307
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
Christy says think about what this is actually

308
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Only doing

309
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,055
You pull out a coin when you're dealing with something that can

310
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
Cannot be divided like

311
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,871
What movie to watch or what

312
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
What TV show to watch

313
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,455
Yap and flipping a coin gives to people

314
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
The same chance of getting

315
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
How to choose

316
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Fair

317
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Random assignment

318
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
And if you have more than two people

319
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
You can use a similar protocol

320
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
But it has a way

321
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,279
Way cooler sometimes

322
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,375
This house of the Eyrie name of random dictatorship

323
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Random dictator

324
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,495
Oh I like that

325
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,311
Friends and you want to decide what to do tonight okay

326
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,967
The one way to be fair about the decisions to say I'm going to sleep 5 face you know

327
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Daiso k

328
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Yeah

329
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,575
And you know whoever is elected

330
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
Will decide the whole plant

331
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,439
We'll decide what restaurant to go to a movie to go to the party.

332
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
He has a name

333
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
Sounds bad random dictatorship

334
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
But you know automatically

335
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,679
Sounds good if you would

336
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
Christie says the random dictatorship

337
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Is more common than you might

338
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,847
I think in fact it is a key part of our judicial system

339
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Take

340
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
The jury

341
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
The Judy's random

342
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
So you have a random guys

343
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Who will make a decision

344
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
So that's what I'm going to be

345
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
Is randomly take a subset of

346
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,695
Kenousa

347
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
Time to make a decision

348
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
How would we apply this

349
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
To the boat

350
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
I guess this was a small different people have different perspectives

351
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,983
What is fat in different situation

352
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,847
After the break we go back to the boats

353
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,479

Our Fair division expert coasties says

364
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,423
It is not his job to Define

365
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471

00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
In the case of the public Harbor

The city of Santa Fe

370
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Systems the harbor

371
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895

As in

375
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
A full reset of the harbor

376
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,575
Cancel everybody's existing permits

377
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,879
Then reallocate those permits

Randomly

379
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:52,511
Does nothing bad with the lottery is inconvenience going to be inconvenient for people but ultimately

380
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,327
That is super 4310b buddy equally

381
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,959
Okay that makes sense if that is how the city wants to Define fair

382
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
Of course there would be

383
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,543
A lot of very angry boat owners who got their permit

384
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,359
Another solution coasties mentioned

385
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
Time sharing

386
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,503
When you have limited resources one way you can allow more people to use them is by letting people.

387
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Take turns

388
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
But with boats that is

389
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Not so practical

390
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
Because where exactly are boogers supposed to be

391
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
They're both when it's not there

392
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,487
Turn of course there is the money versions

393
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
You use money as a proxy

394
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
For who values these

395
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
If you want to perm it badly enough

396
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
And you can afford it

397
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
You can buy one

398
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
After the voters who

399
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Can't afford a spotted

400
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
The doc

401
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,103
What the system is supposed to benefit them to

402
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,503
You know it depends on your definition of yesterday so like if if I can know if my Citi can extracting a million dollars

403
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
From the billionaire okay

404
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,367
And build a school next to the dark okay

405
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,439
You know or you know Builder

406
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,279
Kindergarteners or whatever next to the dogs that people food then go to

407
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:01,375
To cruise terminal leave their kids play in the kindergarten

408
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
The furnace is very complexed

409
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Define Mathematica

410
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,407
Back at the Santa Barbara Harbor Nick Crompton the Harbormaster said

411
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
When he started his job

412
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
He was already

413
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
The investors had already begun sinking money into theirs

414
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,599
Counting on getting it back again

415
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
What a prophet

416
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,951
Nick says now yours later at the harbor change that system

417
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
They would say

418
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,791
And if the harbor made selling slip permits illegal

419
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,839
It wouldn't fix the problem either it would just

420
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
Create a whole other kind of

421
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Because

422
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
This whole scene with Wunderground

423
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
In other words the underground economy

424
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,615
Has so many tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of dollars invested in it

425
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
It's not going away

426
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,759
There's no way it's going away what are you doing away with slip permit transfer

427
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
Fees or not

428
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
Or slip permit transfers

429
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:58,463
People will take out life insurance policies on each other those set up phony corporations

430
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,047
And functionally the whole thing will continue the way it does now

431
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
Without any oversight

432
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
For municipal control

433
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,447
If you open the waiting list today how many names do you think

434
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
Quit go on it

435
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Thousand

436
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
Micset Nick decided

437
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
If this multimillion-dollar

438
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Economy for

439
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,639
Public dock space

440
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Was going to exist

441
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,991
Then the public should find a way to get its fair share

442
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,807
Somic started to make it more and more expensive

443
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
To sell your dog

444
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
Used to cost 25 bucks

445
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
Transfer your spot

446
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,743
Now they can go for as high as $500

447
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
So if you own a c

448
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
60 foot boat we are talking

449
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
30

450
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Grant

451
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,959
Now this is not a solution that all boat owners rj

452
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,799
For sure it creates a situation where you need money

453
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
To get a boat

454
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
That is less fair for the Santa Barbara Inns

455
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
Who have boats

456
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,687
But not as much money

457
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
Arguably though

458
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
It is fairer

459
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,271
For all

460
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
The transfer fee

461
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:00,927
Goes into Waterfront apartment coffers if you will into our operating budget

462
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
And we use that to maintain the harbor

463
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
For the public for the public

464
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,351
To accommodate voting and make sure the facilities are kept up

465
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,167
Right we're walking on a wooden dock

466
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,495
All the planks of which have been replaced over the years you can see it

467
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,079
Is pressure treated you can even you can see where you know

468
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,943
It's a high-quality doctor I are full of splinters and what have you those people shouldn't be walking on

469
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
Wooden docks in their bare feet

470
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,783
Mixes this money also helps pay

471
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
Fire boats

472
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
Law enforcement

473
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
The First Responders

474
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,439
The Harbor Patrol gets a lot of medical calls

475
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
If someone has a

476
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
The heart attack or gets

477
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Sick on the water

478
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
Mix at the other thing that they

479
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
These massive transfer fees do

480
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
Is make it less appealing to invest in a dock slip

481
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,215
Because when you sell your permit this

482
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,007
Giant chunk of money is going to

483
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,031
It cut into your profit

484
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:52,127
And sure enough when Nick and I still do the harbor the rusty canoes

485
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
They were almost all time

486
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,759
There were just a couple of exceptions that looked like they were

487
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Floating placeholders

488
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
Protecting and invest

489
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
Spots the Santa Barbara.

490
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
Sorry to hear that

491
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
You said here's an example

492
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,719
What's the scribal we're looking at here that is

493
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
It's a mold ridden

494
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
Crepid

495
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
Loading

496
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,727
Thing that looks not used very much and maybe operable you know

497
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:23,103
Kayak tied to it it may be used for you know the kite kayaking nothing else

498
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,711
But the boat itself probably isn't worth I'm guessing more than 500 $750

499
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
Weekend those investment boats are rare

500
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,367
And mixes this solution seems to be working as best as possible

501
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:40,255
Most people are actually using the harbor for commercial fishing or recreational boating

502
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,815
And the public Harbor is now getting a

503
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Pretty nice

504
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,887
Cut of a millions of dollars

505
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,423
Sloshing around

506
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,751
Let me ask you if you have a weird question which is

507
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
Do you think that this is

508
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
And I'm looking up perfect

509
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,919
World in a perfect Harbor

510
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
Is this the most

511
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
So your solution or is this the solution that had to be adapted given all of the history and the

512
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,927
Like if you were going to start again

513
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,487
And build a harbor from scratch

514
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,047
Would you do things the same way

515
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,071
No mixer

516
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,143
If you could start from scratch he take the money out of it

517
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
If I find a different way to define fairness

518
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
But this is the system he's stuck with

519
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,591
And that's something to keep in mind if you ever find yourself fairly dividing

520
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,407
Think hard about the system you pick

521
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
At the very beginning

522
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,223
The way you define fairness

523
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:38,879
Because you may be stuck without definition for a very very long time

524
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
Is there a fair division problem ruining your life

525
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,071
Definitely want to know about that

526
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
