He started working on campaigns

79
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,856
Back in the 1970s he worked on every Republican political campaign that matter

80
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,928
And then metaforte had a realization

81
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
He was getting really close

00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Powerful

Really trust him

85
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,168
I never look at all this good will that he's building any stinking

86
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
What can I do with all of

87
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264

90
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
He has all this access

91
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:04,224
He's gained through working on these Republican campaigns at a high level

92
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
Define strongman

93
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,600

Torture

100
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,167
And they signed up Paul manafort to be there in five

101
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,263
And one of the most important parts of his job was to make them look better in wash

00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
Lost an election where his opponent

113
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303

Could be the place for you

120
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,967
It's a weak state power is shared

121
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Between corrupt

122
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
Politicians and

123
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
Competitive oligarchy

124
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
It's a place where people will look

125
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,903
The other way Savannah for 10 Sub Shop

126
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
MTF

And he starts supplying his touch

128
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
Viktor Yanukovych

129
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,815

During TV interview

133
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,519
And then your coverage goes on the road he comes to Washington

134
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Remember

135
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
He's a Putin Ally

136
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
But in Washington his message is

137
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
Pro-west

138
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,247
There can never be too much democracy

139
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,551
Ozark canopy too much freedom

140
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
So on message

141
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
That is what the indictment

142
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Manafort

143
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,743
That he was working to improve yanukovych's Imogen Washington

144
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
But that he

145
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:56,351
Didn't register as a foreign lobbyist which is a crime

146
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,655
But on top of that the indictment says

147
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
Did manafort not register

148
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
But took active

149
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Skeptical

150
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Feel the fact

151
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
That he was actually the lobbyists Rihanna cover

152
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,663
Okay so that's one of the things the feds are accusing manafort of hiding

153
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
That he was

154
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
Lobbying for a foreign

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Leader butt

156
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
There's something else.

157
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Computers are cute

158
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
Yeah they're accusing him of hiding

159
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Money

160
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
And more money

161
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
And even more money the government says

162
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Viktor Yanukovych

163
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
Kept paying

164
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
Paul manafort over all these years

165
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
I told the money swelled up

166
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,143
275 million dollars all off the books

167
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,703
Just piling up in accounts

168
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Here

169
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Put a pin

170
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
In this but there is an island in the Mediterranean

171
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
Disparity is a way of life

172
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,319
Cyprus known for its beautiful beaches decades-long unresolved

173
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
No conflicts

174
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,647
And also banking system that

175
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Don't ask a lot of questions

176
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,279
Yeah the time banks in Cyprus were really popular place for Russians to

177
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
Stash their money

178
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:04,959
When Cyprus became a member of the EU opportunities Drew for invested in a country with low Taxation and then

179
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,567
Expanding economy the government says manafort opens up a bunch of bank account

180
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
Not under his own name but

181
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
Under the names of

182
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Shelter

183
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,015
For now the money is out of

184
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
In Cypress

185
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:24,159
This is not where manafort lives he has houses in New York

186
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Florida

187
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Virginia

188
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
Really expensive

189
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
Food places

190
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,583
You'll never probably wants to spend some of his money there

00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,655
Milford Kansas wire the money home without being noticed

192
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,471
Banksy's more than $10,000 moving into

193
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
The system

194
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
They have to report it

195
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Thanks a lot of rules

196
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,311
Instafollow

197

But he does get them

198
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,735
How he gets the money and makes for very interesting reading I have the indictment right here

199
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
What are we got

200
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Here

201
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
Payments relating to 3 Range Road

$163,000

203
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:59,743
Or look at the sun here he wires $1000000 to an antique

204
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,607
Run store in Virginia

205
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,703
He also drops a half million bucks at a clothing store in Beverly Hills

206
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,775
Associated Press they did the detective work I love this is it

207
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Emporium of choice

208
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
The house of Bijan

209
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
We're ties go for $1,000

210
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,527
Good afternoon beijing how can I help you

211
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,647
Oh okay are you are you really the most expensive store in the world is that just like a nickname

212
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
No this is not a nickname

213
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
We are

214
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
You are really the most expensive store in the world

215
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
Yes we are

216
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
All right

217
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
This man is spending money

218
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Play fast

219
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
But there is

220
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,775
Still a lot of money left on Cypress remember he's stashed 75

221
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
Million dollars in this very safe

222
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,383
Island in 2012

223
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
Something happened

224
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,735
In Cypress that made it a less desirable

225
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
Nice to have an overseas bank account

226
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
A financial crisis

227
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
Pretty bad one

228
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,135
Cypress gets a bailout

229
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
But one of the conditions of this bailout

230
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,975
Is a lot more screwed

231
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:08,351
Foreign bank accounts suddenly the island doesn't look like necessarily the best place

232
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,119
Departure money

233
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775
And right around this time prosecutors say manafort starts moving his money to the US in big

234
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
Durand bigger chunks

235
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,103
And that brings us

236
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Your neighborhood Andrea

237
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,711
Technically but close by Carroll Gardens Brooklyn

238
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
I feel like I'm in

239
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
The Sesame Street version of Brooklyn

240
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
Sunny is glistening

241
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Stairs

242
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,999
You know fall is here so I see yellow leaves and walk you through a tunnel of trees

243
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,303
For now on Union Street it is a nice

244
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Block there is a row of

245
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,887
Brownstone houses most of them

246
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,935
Really pretty Gardens

247
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
Out front

248
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
Plants squatting on the windowsill

249
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
321a

250
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
370

251
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
3

252
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
370

253
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
Getting close

254
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
3/7

255
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Wait a minute

256
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
We assumed it

257
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
77

258
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
Address has been

259
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
Scraped off of sod

260
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
Straight out front

261
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:14,399
Butcher paper covering the windows renovation

262
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
I feel nervous

263
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
It's not luck

264
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,223
Hello

265
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,271
Can we take a look

266
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,927
He says he's not sure it's a good idea

267
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,511
Didn't sound like it explicit as we know though

268
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
I don't think it's a good idea

269
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
This house is no evidence

270
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
In a federal criminal case

271
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
This Brownstone

272
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,847
Properties that are used in these shoes games are these gleaming Towers

273
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
Would like Central Park views

274
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,503
Not some nondescript Brownstone in Carroll Gardens

275
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
That we had good taste

276
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:08,671
This house seems like a normal house but there is nothing normal about the way it was

277
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Prosecutors say

278
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,023
This house is how manafort moved

279
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
Millions out of Cyprus

280
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
And into the you

281
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
This is how they say he did it so

282
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
First shell company that he controls in Cypress by his house for another shell company that he controls in Brooklyn for 3

283
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
$3000000

284
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
AllCast

285
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
So that's how the money

286
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Gets

287
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
To this country

288
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Then

289
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
Three years later manafort

290
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
Takes out a loan on this house

291
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
For $5000000

292
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:41,951
According to the indictment what is now done as he's now taking the dirty money from Yanukovych

293
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,231
And turned it into

294
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
Clean money from an American Bank

295
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
So if you believe the government story

296
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
That

297
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Is money laundering

298
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
Right and remember the timing is important

299
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
Tear in February of 2016

300
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,775
And it's very same month

301
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
Paul manafort's seized an opportunity a workout

302
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
To work

303
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
For the Republican front-runner in the race for president

304
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Donald J Trump

305
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
Write a memo.

306
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,343
And the first thing he offers the very top of this memo

307
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
To work for free

308
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Which is so strange

309
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
But

310
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
Donald Trump loves a deal

311
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
He says yes

312
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,351
Remember at this point even though Trump is leading his campaign is in

313
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Chaos

314
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,215
So if people know about manafort's foreign clients

315
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
In Washington

316
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,591
Kissing someone that people can do business with they know him so you can almost

317
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
Hear the relief

318
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,711
What comes on the scene chairman of the Trump campaign the head coach if you will

319
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
Palmetto Ford

320
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,527
Set reminder for walking back to the shelter

321
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:43,391
Ask you about Trump how you get along with him

322
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
Manafort comes in

323
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,743
Trump gets all the delegates he needs

324
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
What's the system better than me

325
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
16 other candidates

326
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Dropped out

327
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
Marches to the convention

328
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
Get the nomination

329
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
Get the convention bounds

330
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
A metaphor is brought into this place

331
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Which is why

332
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
I alone

333
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Can fix it

334
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,831
So few weeks after the convention the story start surfacing about manafort

335
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
How he's

336
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,183
Earned millions of dollars from a leader in you

337
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
Crane and never reported

338
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
The incoming

339
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:25,631
This mysterious Ledger turns up out of nowhere in Kiev it has all these Cyrillic scribblings in it detailing

340
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,703
12 million dollars of payments to manafort

341
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Simon Says

342
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
He did nothing wrong

343
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
But

344
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,895
The election is now getting really close so manafort doesn't want to draw negative attention

345
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
He leaves

346
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,711
I mean the media was covering

347
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,759
Chargers what you're letting with you

348
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
After the election were proven to be false

349
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,647
And

350
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
Treatment for

351
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,487
Why is being investigated

352
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,815
As we all know now I mean the FBI had been zeroing in on those

353
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Foreign payments

354
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,655
Then special counsel Robert Mueller enters the scene

355
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,959
Accelerate the investigation there's that

356
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
Raid manafort's house in

357
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,055
Virginia in July of this year

358
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,359
And then in October the FED slapping Woody

359
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
12 count indictment

360
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Really fast

361
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,759
Count 1 conspiracy against the United States

362
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,111
Count to conspiracy to launder money counts three through six

363
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,695
Failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts

364
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
12 Cantona

365
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,559
Manafort faces more than 15 years in prison

366
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Metaphor

367
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,423
His spokesman and his lawyer Kevin Downing they all declined an interview

368
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Request

369
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
Manafort

370
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
Pleaded not guilty

371
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,871
And in a written statement is team says that manafort quote looks forward

372
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:43,199
Having the allegations tried before a judge and jury

373
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
His lawyer says

374
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,783
There's no crime and having a foreign Bank

375
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
I can count and his client

376
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,439
Didn't register the foreign lobbyist what they say is no one gets prosecuted for that

377
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
Now there is a gag order

378
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,863
Before the order came down there was a court appearance and Kevin Downing spoke to reporters

379
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,423
And the first thing out of his mouth

380
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,727
Had nothing to do with money laundering

381
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
But I think you also it today

382
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
The President Donald Trump was correct

383
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
There is no additives

384
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,223
The Mr maniford of the Trump campaign colluded

385
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
With the Russian government

386
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
It is true

387
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
This indictment focuses

388
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,367
All on you

389
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:27,743
Craney and money and the only mention of Russia is when the FED say manafort had an office

390
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Is there

391
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
But

392
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,119
For those of us who are reading this indictment super closely

393
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,191
There is the name of a shell company

394
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
That manafort use

395
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
By his apartment

396
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,103
In Trump Tower in Amber Trump Tower number 43 G

397
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
Not too far below Donald Trump

398
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,039
We know from our reporting that manafort has done the same thing with the

399
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,575
The Trump Tower apartment that

400
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
He did with those

401
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
Soho condo and the Brooklyn

402
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Townhouse

403
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Namely

404
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
He buys it for all cash

405
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,511
He hold on to it for a while

406
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
Name and then he takes

407
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,423
A loan out on that that's the same pattern outlined in the indictment

408
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,751
That is how prosecutors describe part of manafort's alleged money launder

409
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Should be clear

410
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
We don't know where the money came from for the Trump Tower of

411
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,919
A metaphor says everything is legit

412
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
What does Transit

413
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Factions

414
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
But

415
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,575
He told us the same thing last winter about that Brooklyn Brownstone

416
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,671
And now it's in a Federal indictment

417
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
All right after the break we're going to talk to a professional money launderer about how to not get

427
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,815
We were curious

428
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,375
If you look at this whole alleged moneyline

429
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
Ukraine Cyprus

430
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471

431
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
Was it even a good scheme

432
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
We wanted to review every step

433
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
And I tracked down

434
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Kind of an

435
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Expert

436
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
His name is Umberto Juan Aguilar

437
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,783
Now that you're now that you've served your time you want to tell me how much you laundered

438
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
I don't know

439
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
I could be over 200

440
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
It's a lot of money

441
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,535
Okay

442
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
Does it became a full-time job

443
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
Back in the 1980s in Miami

444
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
There was a lawyer who did a lot of work

445
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
People in the narcotics industry

446
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,519
Coke is a very lucrative business

447
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Very loopy

448
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
So these guys had all this cash

449
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
Just lying around in store

450
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,223
Piling up in their toe

451
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
Found a way

452
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Way to get the money

453
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,831
And then back into the

454
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
In secret for a little while

455
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
He did serve 7

456
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
Anyway we want to discuss

457
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
On the manafort indictment

458
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,399
Remember he's a lawyer Mastermind of his own money laundering schemes

459
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
He devoured

460
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,239
Yeah I want you to tell me

461
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
What were your first thoughts

462
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
As you were looking through this

463
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Indictment

464
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
How stupid can you be

465
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
Berta says manafort

466
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
First mistake

467
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
Hit the money well

468
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
But then he makes

469
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,343
Quite open fight by buying things in the United States

470
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
And another mistake

471
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,463
When huberto was laundering money he created shell companies

472
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Within shell companies

473
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
Shell companies

474
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,303
Make a money order to

475
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,143
He's a visit Diamond it doesn't seem like manafort did.

476
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
It is bewildering

477
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,519
You committed the Perfect Crime you got paid a lot of money what you didn't declare

478
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,543
That's your crime

479
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
No

480
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
Keep hiding it for the rest of your life and you'll be okay

481
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
You know shelterin

482
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,247
Do something by property in United States not under your name or on

483
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,551
And don't act like this is your property

484
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
Because people it's your property

485
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
One more

486
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,951
America says manafort just bought too much stuff

487
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,487
Message was too fancy

488
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
Light retention

489
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
Lose yourself but it's not stupidity it's

490
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
It's hubris

491
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,263
And it's like I can do anything I want more

492
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:29,663
All of the story if you're going to do something sketchy maybe just keep a low profile

493
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,655

510
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,207
I feel like there's been a ton of media

511
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,023
The neighbors have been here they put

512
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047

Really

516
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,703
How accurate was the depiction

517
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,287
Really good though that's pretty dresses

518
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079

Artsy critique

522
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
