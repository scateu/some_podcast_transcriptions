YouTube channel what's on his mind he's really into Doctor Who

Commitments I'm afraid of multitasking I'm afraid of My Little Pony

29
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,312
Did you seem like very put together but not

30
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:21,408
Secretary search Lee swap because you made a big deal of how he was like

31
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
Socially awkward

32
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,480
I like I was a pretty socially awkward

33
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,528
Can I hear myself so I thought you know

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
I don't have to be like

35
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
Cool

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
I can just be like Charlie

37
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,976
Anyway I was watching this video one of his tours of his room

38
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,328
You know I feel comfortable having you around so I think it's about time that I showed you around

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
The crib

40
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
Here you go

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,032
He said I look that's a world record certificate right there behind me did I ever tell you that I have

42
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
Is a cuz I have a Guinness World Record

43
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,968
I have the world record for typing the alphabet in the fastest time on an iPad

44
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,320
He's even cooler because I thought I had the book

45
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
That would be the Guinness book

46
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,160
Of World Records Edward had a copy

47
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,208
Any idea of being in this book

48
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,536
Seemed amazing to everyone online to see what Charlie is typing record

49
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,632
It turned out that his time was 6.31 seconds

50
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
Everything

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
I'm a fast typist

52
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,008
Just for fun he tries typing the alphabet on his own iPad

53
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,128
And he's really fast after practicing for an hour he's faster than Charlie he is

54
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Beating the world record

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
So I was like okay I have to have to

56
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Like I can do this

57
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
I thought you know who

58
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
Find out about it

59
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
I know it's hard hose makers like

60
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Equals in Samsung

61
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648

62
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,232

64
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
Tempting record as his mom to film inside

65
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
On her phone

66
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,656
But you know sometimes you tell your parents about something

67
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
And they started me

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,776
Make a really big deal out of it and they want to lick and bite your families are filming it and all the sudden

69
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
You just

70
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,592
Wish you never told them at all

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
This happened to Edward

72
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Like

00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Times a million

74
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,528
I don't know if I should get into the president thing but

75
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,600
Should I get into it though that your dad was the president of Georgia

76
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,000
Edwards dad was the president of joy

77
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:17,120
And like that sargis super proud of his son and he's excited about this thing that he's trying to do

78
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,704
But he's also the president's was thinking about National presidential

79
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Issues

80
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,872
One of the things he's been doing is trying to establish Georgia as a place for technological innovation he's been making this push

81
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,968
And he thinks Edwards Guinness record could fit into this

82
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736

00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,599
So we were at a street ice house because he was about to try to break another record

135
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,159

In a minute

144
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
We have a balloon setup on a board

145
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,823
You know it feels like it's like a carnival or something

146
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
It does look like a carnival

147
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
The Chopsticks have these kind of sharp

148
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Metal tip

149
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431

Measuring everything out with a tape measure to make sure that she didn't stand

00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,559
Exactly the proper distance away from the balloons when he starts hurling chopsticks with them

156
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,631

Speaking of new record I'm so excited to tell you guys

234
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,063
The 2018 Edition is out now and the United

235
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:33,951
Ashrita Furman is in this book multiple times book promotion promotion

236
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,767
This moment is why Genesis

237
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
Is here they want to sell books

238
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
Guinness Book of World Records is one of the best

239
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,655
Selling books of all time

240
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
And this is amazing

241
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
Especially if you consider the Guinness started out as a

242
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,311
Little book that the Guinness beer company used to hand out

243
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
Pubs to settle bar fight

244
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
Is that they were the same company for decades

245
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
The beer guys and the record guy

246
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
Eventually Guinness Brewery was bought up by this big

247
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Beverage conglomerate

248
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
And Guinness Records Was spun off

249
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:08,255
Little company was on its own and needed to fend for itself but that was fine because every year Guinness came out with a new edition

250
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
And every year that new edition was a best

251
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Cellar

252
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,167
In fact a lot of the people in the Guinness book bikinis

253
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Cultural icon

254
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,495
Concert pictures were known around the world

255
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,335
Tallest man with shortest woman the woman with the smallest waist

256
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
Peter Harper as a senior vice president

257
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175

258
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,551
Longest fingernails is another totally iconic record remember that photo from the old days

259
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Guinness book in r

260
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:37,951
Great Library that's that's it. That's one of the photos the other photo is The McCrary twins

261
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Who are the heaviest

262
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:45,631
World's fattest twins on the motorcycle I remember that picture

263
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,959
The band Genesis book sale started doing what everybody

264
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Falling

265
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
I was hoping you wouldn't get to that question

266
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,151
I think we're certified generally following the industry Guinness needed a new way to make

267
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
But it was not obvious

268
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
How do you make money off of the amazing photo of the man with the

269
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Fingernails

270
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Anybody out there could you

271
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Google it for

272
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
For free

273
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,927
And that is the moment the Guinness realize

274
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
That their new business model

275
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Was literally knocking on there

276
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
Company started coming to us asking if we could fly someone out to their event companies and people will come

277
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,495
Coming to Guinness wanting to break a record for publicity

278
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
To draw attention to

279
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
They've got none of the fact that if they

280
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,127
Achieve a record title

281
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,783
Did they get a lot of press for it or they get a lot of shares on social media increasingly they want to make it more of a market

282
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,343
Any event they want to invite one of our judicators

283
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,647
And then the the usage of the logo

284
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
Guinness realized they could charge for

285
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
A lot

286
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,607
Price tag for a full-service event starts at $12,000 and goes up over half-a-million

287
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Peter says did you

288
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
You hundreds of events like this

289
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447

Fascinated by the

302
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
The people were

303
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Breaking records

304
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Pushing the limits of

305
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
What it meant

306
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
To be a human

307
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
Genesis customers now

308
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,023
Are the record Breakers themselves

309
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
If you pay Guinness enough money

310
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
They will help you figure out a record you

311
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
You can break

312
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
And they will help

313
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Break it

314
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,823
Guinness is even sitting up places where members of the public can come in and attempt record

315
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Personal fear

316
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Of course

317
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,431
Guinness is now in the business of selling record-breaking

318
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
And they're really good at it

319
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,343
There is something about you I bet Stacy that you do that no one does as well

320
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
Oh so you think I have a world record of Me Maybe I think you do somewhere you should think hard about that and you know who to call if

321
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
If you come upon something

322
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,327
You can still break a Guinness World Record

323
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
That does not cost

324
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,935
You can go to the website print out the rules for breaking a record

325
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,727
Before the event send it in brakes

326
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:35,359
But here's the thing that the rules for breaking a record or really really complicated in particular

327
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
Can take months to get a response from Guinness

328
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
People who pay money they got a device that can help that

329
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
Jump the line response

330
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
Does it feel at all like

331
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,647
Part of Guinness is Mission was compromised in a way or the

332
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:54,559
It kind of Tainted the record-breaking 2 to charge will

333
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,655
At the time and it is a question we are mindful of because

334
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
If we

335
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,519
Compromise our reputation for being an authority

336
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
The business

337
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Goes

338
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Down the tubes

339
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Really

340
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Pretty quickly

341
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Some people think

342
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
It already has

343
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,879

I throw knives

347
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071

350
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,679

Live knife throwing show

356
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
We promised to end each show

With an attempted

358
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
World record

359
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
And it was in that

360
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
At that time that I had

361
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319

00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,367

369
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
And a couple months later

370
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
He gets an email

371
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
They weren't interested in the knights record

372
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,247
They weren't interested in a record involving

373
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Knife throwing

374
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
Knives around human talk

375
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
How did you feel when you read that email

376
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
I was crushed

377
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,999
Attorney says he saw that Guinness had created a knife throwing record

378
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
How to publicize event around

379
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
Is Prince William

380
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
That was about money

381
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
Get us. This new record scene

382
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,703
Cool they wanted to find a way to cash in on it

383
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
So they gave it to someone else

384
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
It's it's all about money

385
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
And if you don't

386
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
Get involved with the money side

387
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
Of what they're doing

388
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Then

389
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,503
What you do falls to the Wayside

390
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,319
All this was a decade ago and even throw Genie isn't

391
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,343
Sure what happened

392
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
Eventually made it into

393
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
What he says

394
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,231
If you're not paying money I can feel really hard

395
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
And really discourage

396
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791

397
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,607

00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,407
I was just thinking I have to get this right

430
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
If I failed

431
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,479
What would the media say

432
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,575

Oh my God

439
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,519
Every dude really started out in front of an old-school Guinness

440
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,847
Spirit write what you just wanted to break this record

441
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,175
For the joy of breaking the record you are trying to promote your

442
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,479
Personal brand make money or anything like that but then

443
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,295
You kind of sucked into guinnesses new business

444
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,367
Yeah I mean this is just going to be for me but

445
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:07,999
Sitting there looking around at these people are the shirts and all the logos it just felt like my record have been hijacked

446
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
And in very publicly

447
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,959
But anyway here it is the big moment you're sitting in a chair there all these people crowded around you

448
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
I was very nervous

449
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
So there you are

450
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799

451
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
You're typing

00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
Tasks really fast

453
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:29,247
Yes and I stopped typing you can see I raise my arm to say stop I'm done

454
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:33,087
Okay and then the adjudicator is looking at her stopwatch

455
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855

456
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879

Podium it's okay not the suspense is killing me I can't even

00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
She's now going to

459
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
Muntu

460
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,071
A microphone to an ABS

461
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,863

462
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887

She's like raising over your head

472
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,487
The Guinness branding and polishing at work

473
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
Anyways

474
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,351
Did it work was this a big news event in Georgia

475
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,935
Totally all the news channels running as their top item that after

476
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
Afternoon everybody found out

477
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,031
And then four months afterwards everybody I met

478
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,639
Top and Teo congratulations what a great accomplishment

479
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,503

Attract

481
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
The website

482
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
And it said

483
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,879
Oh my gosh you the record for 4 weeks

484
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,719
How did you feel better this record have been broken after

485
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Just 4 weeks

486
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,327
I don't think I really cared honestly I was a little sick of hearing about it

487
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,167
How to make a phone make sense because

488
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
What Katniss was really selling

489
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
Was the

490
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,031
Experience of breaking a record

491
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Write it sort of a service

492
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,383
I mean that is with the ministry of sports

493
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223

494
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,527

495
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
Guinness

496
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343

Even if it's covered um record I still feel like

503
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,959
The theory of Guinness has so much

504
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,567
Pull that. Even it even fools me knowing that

505
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
Even if I know

506
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383

So

547
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:28,352
I'm feeling really weird right now like I'm feeling a little bit like Starstruck or something like physically I have this kind of

548
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
Like heart pounding in my chest

549
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
For the feeling

550
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752

It is a certain lightness I feel lighter

553
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
I got all this

554
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:53,184
Like all this media attention and stuff at the time but I felt like it was coming from the wrong place
