1
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:08,192
Imagine you are a b

2
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:12,032
A honey and every morning you wake up in the greatest place

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,312
Honor Flight

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,616
Not so high you are

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,896
You are waking up

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,432
In rural Louisiana

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,992
You got your cypress trees

8
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:25,600
You got your flowering plants and legumes you you see your

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,952
Blue Vervain you see your buckwheat Vine you see your Tallow trees

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,768
That is the voice of your boss wescard

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,888
Well technically you work for the queen bee and she works for West but the job you have is pretty Kush

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,704
You're collecting nectar making honey

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
West takes your honey

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,008
Selzer honey

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,312
Your bike a team

16
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
But

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
Infected

18
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:53,760
One night while you were sleeping you hear it a forklift coming for your high

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
And all of the surrounding Heights

20
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
Hand

21
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,416
We start picking them up and moving around and set them on new pallets and

22
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:04,512
We are then come in with the machines and stack them onto the truck and

23
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,048
The Journey Begins

24
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
The journey

25
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,656
The truck will be taking you and 15 million of your closest

26
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Friends

27
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
On a road trip

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,032
Louisiana Texas New Mexico Arizona

29
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,568
And California

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
2000 miles in all

31
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,712
To the Almond fields in the Central Valley where do you will have a new job

32
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,992
Pollinating

33
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
The almond flour

34
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
Making

35
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
Little almond babies

36
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
What would happen

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,416
If you didn't ship bees to California

38
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,768
If anybody didn't ship bees then you would see a lot of empty shelves

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
In the grocery stores

40
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,888
No Blueberries no almonds no

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,544
No strawberries no squash no pumpkins no I mean the list goes on no oranges no citrus

42
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,872
So the missions fees are on it to prevent

43
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
A fruit and nut epochal

44
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Correct

45
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,272
You are Louisiana B and you

46
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
About to save the world

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
Or Beat It Anyway hello and welcome to Planet Money

Stacey Vanek Smith and Robert Smith right now almost every single commercial be

49
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,704
In the United States of America is on the way to the Almond fields of California

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
The size of this Mass migration is stunning in the span of a few weeks 30 billion bezoar

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,664
Will be shipped from around the country to the Central Valley

52
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:30,272
He will pollinate enough flowers create 700 billion almonds

53
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:35,904
Today on the show we are going to follow the beekeepers who is the co-op in logistical miracle

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,048
The birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees cannot do it alone we are going to need a lot of trucks

This whole bee migration was something we did not know about until we got an email from a listener buck marcussen

63
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,872
He told us around Valentine's Day

64
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
If you drive through Central California

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,224
The highways are filled with honey bees

66
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,040
Trucks full of hungry angry

67
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,112
Honey bees billions of them being driven from all corners of the

68
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
Converging on the almond

69
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,440
Which

70
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
When you

71
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
Just seems

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
Insane

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,328
And we nominated you Robert Smith

74
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
To go check this out put on a

75
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
Bee suit

76
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
The whole journey started at least for me and my b

77
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
In Bunkie Louisiana

78
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,056
If you picture Louisiana as a boot

79
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336
Bunky's right at

80
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
At the ankle bone

81
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
Good thing you drive along the Bayou

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
Flat open land

83
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,248
And then all of a sudden you see what looks like

84
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,296
1000 silver file cabinet

85
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Just sitting out in the field

86
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
These are the beehives

87
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
Now they told me to get to the farm right at sunset

88
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
When Sky turns.

89
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
You only want to move bees

90
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Welbeze always

91
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
Naturally return

92
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,607
To The Hive after

93
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Sundown

94
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,215
If you try to move them before Sunday they wouldn't go to find their hot

95
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
Yes you leave a bunch of them hear loss

96
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
With nowhere to go

97
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,383
The Beekeeper West card he doesn't bother to wear a bee suit most

98
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
What's the time

99
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,711
That almost dares

100
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,991
The Beast is stinky

101
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Elbows out his feet wide apart

102
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,391
You can actually see a few bees crawling in his long goatee

103
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:49,279
Actually I'd rather I'm getting stuck on the beer then staying in the chin so that's why I have a beard

104
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
Step back one more cuz this one's actually hitting the back of my head

105
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,519
They extract honey in a shed out in the back

106
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,847
The bee Wranglers all live in a Double Wide Trailer by the road

107
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
Anheuser zipping by on forklift

108
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
The only bee colonies with a thick blanket of bees

109
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,271
Get picked for the California

110
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
They want the strongest one

111
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
So West

112
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Prize open the top

113
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
When I want to check

114
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
So you can see

115
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
That high

116
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
Has very few bees

117
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
Well looks like there's hundreds but

118
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
100 is not very many

119
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
So what happened with hot

120
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,655
That's a good question

121
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,239
These days and the bee business it is just a fact of life

122
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
Bees are dying at a higher rate

123
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Then they used to

124
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,383
So West races to hives for everyone that the ship

125
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
You can have thousands of hives

126
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Lined up

127
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,087
That just are not ready to go to California that are weak or dead

128
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
Or just not surviving for

129
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
Unknown reasons

130
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,279
And that's happened to you

131
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Osher

132
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
I think it's happened every beekeeper at some point or another

133
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
But this year is a good year

134
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,495
They have a thousand Hive just for tonight rap stacked ready to go

135
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,567
Baby Wranglers add some yellow bee food in the top

136
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
Sack lunch

137
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
For the 3-day trip

138
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
And then what is fully dark

139
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
The tractor

140
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,711
Trailer pulse

141
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,807
Basin 24 truck of the California

142
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
Justin the last couple of weeks

143
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,903
Hundreds of wetherby farms are doing this

144
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Same thing

145
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
All around the cut

146
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Florida

147
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
South Carolina

148
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Oregon from the

149
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Dakotaz

150
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,631
Brother glad he's in charge of this whole loading process

151
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
You said listen like this is what

152
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
Beekeepers have done forever

153
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
I mean they've been moving bees around the country for

154
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,663
Decades you know when the 1800 they were moving them on the back of horses

155
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,295
So it's it's a natural kind of migratory thing for the bees

156
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,087
There's nothing natural about

157
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,135
What's not natural about it

158
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
It's the fact that you're putting

159
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
1000 Hive onto the back of a truck

160
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
Encinitas California

161
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
But this

162
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,399
That they are to perform a natural function

163
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,215
It's just we've we've made that function more efficient

164
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
That's one way to put it

165
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,175
Every almonds you have ever eaten required Abby

166
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
Single bee a bee to move the pollen from the

167
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,551
The flower of one on the tree to the flower of a different woman

168
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
And they're not bees in California to pollinate a small

169
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Omicron

170
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
But over the last few decades almonds have just

171
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Taking off

172
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
Almond milk

173
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
Almond butter

174
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
Low-carb almond snack packs

175
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
England cardi B guy says

176
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
The Almond Growers

177
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Play Store

178
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
This whole thing coming

179
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
20 years ago

180
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
They started planning

181
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
Acres and Acres

182
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
Acres of almonds

183
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,151
Anticipating this demand increase in demand in

184
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
Has those Acres coming to

185
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,271
USA age they require more beehives

186
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,135
More beehives in the beekeepers of California could possibly provide

187
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,463
What's it going to hold me that when their grandfather started the biz

188
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
Dismiss back in Massachusetts

189
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
Of course

190
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
TCAP the bees

191
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
He's close to the crops that's what you did back

192
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,679
The interstate highway system was built it made sense to grow bees

193
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
You know where it was warm

194
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
I never left the flowering plant

195
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,311
It made sense to move the whole operation to Louisiana

196
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
And then all you need it

197
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
What's a lot of trucks

198
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,503
So true that you can put 15 million bees on the back of a truck in about 20 minutes

199
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
It's amazing

200
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,319
The steeple

201
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
Huge net

202
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Over the Heights

203
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
And you can see the Beast inside

204
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Pushing to get out

205
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,327
The lucky driver who gets to babysit these bad boys all the way to fireball California

206
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Kermit Jones

207
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,703
Alright and it's going to Fireball

208
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
How you got

209
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
Covetous the hardest part

210
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
Of driving bees

211
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Is the schedule

212
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
Because

213
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,455
If you stop the truck during the day while it is light out

214
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,063
The bees will try to escape and they're Wily they cancel to get to the Nets

215
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
So you have to

216
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
To keep the truck

217
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,183
Moving you have to keep the high Serta vibrating

218
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Calm down

219
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
So Kermit drives for 11 hours

220
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,375
You know you get started early in the morning make sure you got your fuel

221
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
And everything and then you know you drive till it coming

222
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
Calm down a little bit

223
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
What you need to go to the bathroom

224
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
Couple cups or something like that

225
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
I was going to have to ride with you

226
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
Maybe not

227
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951
Tomorrow night these bees will be sleeping somewhere to truck stop in Amarillo Texas Kingman Arizona is this

228
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
Stop the next night

229
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,279
Been too long Hall to the California border

230
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
An orchard and Fireball

231
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,983
And of course there was a whole other side to the story because out in California there is a fierce competition going on to get

232
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
The best bees

233
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
I need the entire success of an almond crop can really depend on the beach

234
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
He's better Trucking from halfway across the country

235
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
Do people in the Central Valley have been for

236
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Preparing for months

237
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
What is big

238
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Be converted

239
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
Convention

240
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
B con 2017

241
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
Yes it's like spring break for me

242
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,231
Taobao baby

243
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
Albert Furby

244
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,327
So I flew into San Francisco a day ahead of the

245
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
If I drove over the hills to the

246
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Central Valley

247
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,727
And I was told I really need to talk to the person who knows everything and everyone

248
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
The be broke

249
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
She's easy to spot because

250
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
She's the one in the field

251
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
With the pink

252
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Bee suit

253
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
It's a pale pink so the bees do like it

254
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,271
Not that I'm a fashionista but I just couldn't do the wife

255
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,087
And so this way people know it's me

256
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
Denise Qualls runs bee pollination

257
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Connection

258
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
She hooks up beekeepers with almond grout

259
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,535
She's the one making the deals for our Louisiana be

260
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
On the way

261
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,887
Please header pink bee suit set up so she can take cell phone calls

262
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
On a headset from inside the bee suit

263
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,775
And people that actually never stop calling

264
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
Panic B drivers

265
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Stop the California

266
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
Border inspections

267
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
A desperate almond Growers

268
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,223
So I've gotten pictures today of flooded Orchard

269
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
I've got a forklift

270
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
Stuck this morning

271
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,367
And my phone's ringing again let's see who that is

272
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,695
Someone is calling looking for some bees

273
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
So I need to give them a call

274
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
And find out what it is I can do for them

275
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,119
The Almond flowers are about to bloom so this is like

276
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Crunch time

277
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
It's funny because ask annies

278
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Chat on the phone

279
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
She also starts to like

280
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
Pry open the different

281
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
Bee hives in front of her

282
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,639
Because part of her job is also checking to make sure

283
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
That the bees survived

284
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
Oh man look at that one

285
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Pretty

286
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,999
Yeah we're kind of being swarmed a little bit here but that's good that means they're super

287
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,815
Yes and they've been here for a few days so I'm

288
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
Pleasantly surprised with the activity

289
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Wow

290
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,751
He has to check these days because nothing is

291
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
Normal in beekeeping anymore there's

292
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
This is problem with the bees called colony collapse disorder

293
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,223
The first noticed it in 2006 and then suddenly sometimes

294
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
Overnight

295
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,039
Like a hive with just dye

296
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
He would empty out

297
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
The bees would be gone and no one knew why

298
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
Why was out there with Denise Shane Ross

299
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,023
Who is Weber helpers he slipped into the bees in it

300
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
He says

301
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Did she think

302
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,631
There is no one

303
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
Caught his pet theory is that it is all of them

304
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,543
It's the pesticides the herbicides the radio waves

305
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
Changing agriculture loss of bee habitat and and Bee forage leading to poor nutrition the bees

306
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,783
Starve to death in some areas there's just nothing for them to work

307
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,367
It's its death by a thousand paper cuts

308
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
Because it's like a mystery

309
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,975
He creates a real sense of distrust from The Beekeeper

310
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
To like

311
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
Love their hives

312
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,607
State obviously make a living out their hives and they just drop them off in these feel

313
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,959
And it's constantly asking will wait a minute are they being sprayed with pesticides

314
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
Are the farmers

315
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Taking care of the bees

316
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:06,175
Well they imagine this is stressful for the Almond Growers to write any they might be worried that there aren't going to be bees anymore or that

317
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
There aren't going to be enough peas and the price might go way up

318
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,343
Yeah and it has a decade ago you can rent too high for a month

319
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
For about 50 bucks

320
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:19,231
Now it cost $185 for a single hive

321
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,511
For the season

322
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,047
And I can start to add up

323
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,375
This truck of bees that we are following is going to a single Orchard

324
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
And the rental charges for all the bees

325
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
Comes to around $100,000

326
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,567
But so far at least almond Growers don't have much of a choice

327
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
But to pay the bill.

328
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
So this is this is the tree

329
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Is an almond tree

330
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
Deserve technical name you just called almond tree

331
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
There's two varieties Heroes.

332
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
Padres

333
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
This is Kyle Robertson

334
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,695
He isn't almond grower in Tracy California and over the next month

335
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
These trees will be pollinated

336
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
Bybee's from Louisiana

337
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
West cards be

338
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,167
Right now the two kinds of Truth abuse and Padres look totally barren

339
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
But by next week this Orchard will be

340
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
Transformed with flowers

341
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
So beautiful that Kyle took his engagement photos

342
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
Here is a one picture here

343
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
Whoa

344
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,015
It looks like the cherry blossoms in Washington DC

345
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
Gorgeous

346
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,391
White petals everywhere then you'll see white petals on the ground almost looks like

347
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Snow

348
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
Snow covered tree with little bit of snow desktop

349
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
On the ground

350
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:27,583
The flowers are small that the size of a silver dollar and their

351
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
Delicate and the bee have to carry the pollen from

352
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
The Butte to Padre and the Padre to the Butte

353
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
Deposited just perfectly

354
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
To make a single almond

355
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
Alright so series of

356
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
A series of dumb question

357
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
Dog park

358
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Why can't you just hire people

359
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
Take a pollen from One Tree and move it to the other

360
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,063
You can it's just going to take you forever to do it

361
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:54,975
Why not just get a plane filled with pollen and you could just send that address the synthetics

362
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
Look at but again it's it has

363
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Chao

364
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
To be any better than

365
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
The natural pollination with bees

366
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,191
Why don't you just develop a tree that doesn't

367
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
Need a bead on it

368
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,591
You do if there's self pollinating trees that work there's called a variety called Independence in California

369
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
That's more popular one

370
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
You don't necessarily need bees to pollinate

371
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,783
And the self-pollinating tree is slowly catching on

372
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,111
But the almonds are not exactly what buyers are

373
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
They taste different

374
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Difference

375
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
That does not sound like a raining indoors

376
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Different is good

377
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,303
I kept trying to talk to Kyle about how

378
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Strange

379
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,143
This whole be shipping situation is

380
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,239
Like I try and all these theories out on him you know is this the end of nature or

381
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,591
Maybe you just reached the limit of the amount of almond trees you can possibly plant

382
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
But he says like

383
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
I am talking

384
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
Like a news reporter from New York City

385
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
I don't understand

386
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
The way nature

387
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,903
You think Baron Baron the while collecting a beehive off the top of a tree and knocking it down to

388
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
Dita honey

389
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
People's image of it

390
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,559
That's exactly how they are this symbol of

391
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
Wild uncontrolled

392
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
Humanless nature

393
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,727
And so that's what feels weird when you put them on a truck and drive them mm

394
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,311
I can understand that

395
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
Cells that way

396
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,151
But then he says like remember

397
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
Lee's honey bees

398
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
We're not native

399
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
North America

400
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
They were brought over

401
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
And the almond trees

402
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,623
In which we grow here they came from the Middle East

403
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
The kid from Spain

404
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
There is nothing

405
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
Wild or human list

406
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
About any

407
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Park

408
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Of the almond

409
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,911
Situation it is produced on a mass scale for the lowest cost possible

410
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
And it really is massive

411
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,055
As I drive around the Central Valley I can go dozens of miles and see nothing but almonds

412
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:51,711
Almond trees almond trees after almond trees and then I get

413
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:58,111
Hey I'm just coming into Firebox Scar the Louisiana

414
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Puppies have arrived.

415
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,231
Get me directions to an orchard and says meet me at Sunset and

416
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,535
I might want to wear a bee suit for this one

417
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,911
But we're going to want to walk a little bit further back here as we get ready to pull the screens

418
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,215
This is the moment

419
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,359
They're pulling the next off of the high remember the bees have not been able to fly

420
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
For 3

421
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
When the next come down they start to

422
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
Whirl

423
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,551
Around the truck it is like a funnel cloud

424
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,647
It rises above the field to get certified larger and larger

425
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,487
I know you love them but it kind of feels like we're in a horror film right now

426
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Yeah there's a lot here

427
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,607
That sounds terrifying Robert

428
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,423
It was actually little terrified even in abuse

429
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
And what they're doing is

430
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
When a bee is in a new place

431
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
I was told

432
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
They are

433
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:53,407
Circling trying to sort of memorize the new landscape the trying to figure out

434
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
Where their hive is

435
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
What the hell's going on cuz

436
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
California

437
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,391
Are you sure they're not like trying to figure out who did this to them and

438
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:10,047
You know I asked Wes about that they hate you I think they like it we bring him to places that

439
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447
Bring all kinds of fun things you know that's what dads always say to the kids and the kids hated

440
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,983
But I mean

441
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:24,639
As far as the bees are concerned you know right now they're probably not liking it too much because we got another three or four days before the blooms

442
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Starts

443
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,247
But once the bloom is in once the bloom is off then

444
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
Pretty much in

445
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,087
All-you-can-eat buffet for the next 3 or 4 weeks

446
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,951
The city after the bloom is over in a month

447
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
There will not be

448
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,071
A flower or food source to be found

449
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
In miles

450
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,167
That's really the other reason why you can't just keep

451
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
All of the 30 billion bees

452
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,567
In California you know for next year they're already here but the bees would starve

453
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
Once the Almond flowers go away

454
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
The West has to bring them back to Louisiana

455
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,223
But yes to do the whole process in reverse

456
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,367
The whole process putting the food in loading them on the truck put internet on bringing them back on the interstate 3 days

457
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
And then

458
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
They go

459
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,743
For the apple season in New York state blueberries in Maine

460
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Cranberries

461
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
In Cape Cod

462
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
Join the pollination service

463
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,143
See the world I know it seems sweet I mean there is

464
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,703
A small caveat Cosby's only survive a month

465
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,775
So basically the hottest Louisiana

466
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
Are filled with mostly

467
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Nuby I mean I guess

468
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
Born in California bees

469
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,455
Their Generations that are born on the road in the Northeast

470
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,247
So I understand

471
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,807
Why this is happening but it still seems crazy to

472
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,879
And you know if you push the beekeepers

473
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
Hard enough they will say

474
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
It is

475
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
A little crazy

476
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
They just like

477
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
Literally

478
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
Could not come up with a better way to do this

479
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
If you could move the trees

480
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,703
I'm sure they would move the trees to the bees but

481
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
The tattoo

482
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,335
We've always hope that someday we could just train the bees

483
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
The fly themselves to wherever they need to go

484
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
But we haven't been able to figure that out yet

485
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
That would be something

486
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,087
Tracy California

487
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,391
I think he's choking

488
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,743
But after seeing the kind of logistics that I saw I'm not entirely sure

489
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,143
Support Fitbit

490
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:26,495

I'm Stacey Vanek Smith thanks for listening

514
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
There is one

515
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,080
Last thing that I had to see

516
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,896
Before I left the scene I had to

517
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
To see

518
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
The actual pain

519
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
The deed

520
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
The bees Gone Wild

521
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,296
As I was driving

522
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
I spotted

523
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
On the side of the road

524
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
It was one

525
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,440
Almond it was already in bloom

526
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
I forgot it in my car

527
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,560
I'll look look at the picture. It right now right now look

528
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,912
I don't know if you can hear it but Abby is

529
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
Basically hugging

530
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,752
Wiggling around

531
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,032
And that's it

532
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
Before I wake up
