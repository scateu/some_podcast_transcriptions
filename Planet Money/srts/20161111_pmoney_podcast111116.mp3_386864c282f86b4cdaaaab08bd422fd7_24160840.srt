00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,552
You are NPR's senior White House correspondent

12
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,952
Now that's senior but yes I spent the last eight years covering the Obama Administration and I've also been follow

13
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,096
Going to campaign in which Donald Trump promised to undo a great deal of what Barack Obama did over the last 8 years

14
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,168
He wants to roll back Obamacare he wants to build a

15
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,984
New wall on the US Southern border with Mexico

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,032
He wants to deport criminal immigrants

17
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,104
Drain the swamp of corruption in Washington

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,664
And undo what Trump calls

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
Stupid trade deals and that's just the first 100 days

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,184
Are you out there a lot of campaigns candidates say a lot of stuff on the campaign Trail a lot of it does get done some of it doesn't

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,744
But Turley Trump has filled out a bold agenda

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,608
He spelled it out in an address in Gettysburg right he sort of set for the plan for his first

23
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:12,192
Three or so months in office and time and as far as We Know

24
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,472
He sticking to that plan

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,592
That's right up there some stuff you can do in just a very first few days in office with the

The Stroke of a presidential pen

27
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,968
Other things he's going to need help from Congress and that could take a little bit longer

And do good

47
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,368
What is the biggest questions people have been asking about Trump's first 100 days in office

48
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,696
Has to do with the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare

49
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:44,352
Donald Trump talk a lot about wanting to repeal Obamacare on the campaign Trail it was one of his biggest campaign issue

50
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
We have a disaster

51
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Cold

52
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
The big lie

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,008
Obamacare

54
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,176
We asked Stacey Vanek Smith to look into this to see if Trump actually can dismantle Obamacare within his first hundred

55
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
Days and if so how we go about it

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Hey Stacy

57
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Hi Scott

58
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,136
So for this question I called up Lynn Nichols he's a health Economist at George Mason University

59
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,232
And he spent most of his career researching Health Care reform and add

60
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
Educating for Universal

61
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,584
Bridge so he was a big supporter of the Affordable Care Act

62
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,448
In fact when he was watching the election results come in at home with his wife and daughter at the

63
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,984
Sitting around eating pizza

64
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,056
He said this one thought kept going through his head over and over

65
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
As the night wore on

66
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,640
What I saw Stacy was

67
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Basically roughly

68
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,712
Play 25 years of my life

69
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
Being repudiated by half our nation

70
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
They seem to want to repeal

71
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,416
So I asked Randy from could undo Obamacare in his first 100

72
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,000
And he told me it wouldn't take anything near that long

73
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,840
If at all Trump would really have to do would be to drop the white houses

74
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,912
The peel of a lawsuit filed by House Republicans

75
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
A couple of years ago

76
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,264
In that lawsuit the House Republicans were saying the Obama Administration was

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
Spending tens of billions of dollars

78
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
Uncaused

79
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
Tatoosh Lake

80
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,896
Because Congress had not

81
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Appropriated the money

82
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
That money is going to insurance

83
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
And if you took it away

84
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,112
Those insurance company some of them are already wary of the Obama Care Program

85
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Mike Bolt

86
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
For good

87
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,280
Right and this year a Federal District Court ruled in favor of the house and the Obama Administration

88
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Peeled

89
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,839
And that appeal is still in process

90
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:24,191
I mean Obamacare has been subject to multiple legal challenges over the last

91
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
6 years

92
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,287
And for the most part once they reach the higher courts

93
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,639
It has survived but that's because it had an aggressive Champion defending the program

94
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
Take away that aggressive champion and replace it with the

95
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Donald Trump

96
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
Who's eager to see the law unraveled

97
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Maybe very different

98
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
And when said if Trump wanted to he could simply

99
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
We dropped the white houses

100
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
Appeal of that

101
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,487
Jesus the case the house one in Federal District Court

102
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,303
And then Federal money would stop going to insurance come

103
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,375
So that means like he could basically shut off

104
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
Federal payments to

105
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
Insurance Company

106
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Jessica

107
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
How soon like how soon can he do that

108
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
Long as it would take to file

109
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,455
A brief in court saying they were ending the appeal

110
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
Like a week or month

111
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,551
Certainly within a certain could be done within a week

112
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
So to be clear lens does not think that will happen

113
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,207
Been in fact Trump himself has said several times on the campaign Trail

114
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,791
But he's not just going to leave millions of Americans suddenly without health

115
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,375
What do you think will happen is that the Affordable Care Act

116
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
Slowly dismantled and replaced

117
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,007
With some of the plans Republicans have supported

118
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,359
Things like relaxing insurance company regulations when they're dealing across state lines

119
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,663
And also offering tax credits for

120
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
People for their health care

121
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,527
But let's be clear the Republicans have always been a lot more specific

122
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
Can talk about their plans to

123
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
Repeal Obamacare

124
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,671
Then about their plans to replace it with a plan of Their Own

125
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231
If you take away Obamacare which

126
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
Provided insurance coverage

127
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
2 something like 20 million American

128
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,655
And replace it with something that offers coverage to a much smaller

129
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,495
You're talkin about still leaving millions of people who have coverage now

130
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,847
Without a yes exactly in in fact to cover all the people who would lose insurance

131
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Under the Affordable Care Act

132
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Would cost a lot

133
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Of money

134
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
And Linden I think repair

135
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Want to spend that kind of

136
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
Money after all

137
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
Expense was one of the main problems that Republican lawmakers

138
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Have had with Obamacare

139
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,159
Thank you so much

140
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Thanks guys

141
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,863
Okay Scott another big part of President Trump's plans for his first 100 days

142
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,959
I include something that he's calling the end illegal Immigration Act

143
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,031
End illegal Immigration Act

144
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,943
Yeah this was one of the greatest hits at Donald Trump rallies around the country where he talked about building that great big

145
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,527
Big beautiful wall on the US Southern border with Mexico and

146
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
Who's going to pay for it don't worry about it

147
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
Remember I said Mexico is paying for the wall

148
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,719
Mexico of course he said it is not

149
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
Paying for the wall

150
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
You know what I thought.

151
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
What's up

152
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
I thought let's

153
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
Stop arguing

154
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:03,423
Let's come together and just imagine that the money is

155
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,007
Because this will be a massive logistical undertaking

156
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,567
And I really wanted to know if that was at

157
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Sleep posture

158
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,407
So I met this guy Todd sternfeld

159
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Who thinks

160
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
This is possible

161
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,551
I'm the owner and CEO of Superior concrete products

162
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
Todd Mix Concrete and Todd build walls

163
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,927
And Todd has built walls all over the country

164
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,463
But he's in text

165
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,303
So when candidate Trump first said he wanted to build a wall

166
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
Todd sat down and he wrote Trump a letter

167
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,703
And I sent it to Eric Don and Ivanka all three of them

168
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
Dear mr. Trump

169
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
I have stated

170
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:44,127
Trump Hotel for the last several years while exhibiting my products and services

171
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
At the World of Concrete Show in Las Vegas

172
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,039
Your staff and the accommodation have always been superb

173
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,367
He told Trump what he could do walleyes

174
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Trump didn't write back

175
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,463
Todd sent a second letter he hasn't gotten a response yet

176
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:03,071
But here's the thing Todd who knows a thing or two about concrete and walls has actually

177
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,679
Done some arithmetic about what it would take to wall off the US Southern border

178
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,495
How can I the first big hurdle would be

179
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,311
There are people along the border who owns some of this land

180
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,127
Who might not want a big wall going up on their proper

181
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
For that

182
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
Todd has a solution

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,503
Vectra eminent domain situation

184
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,295
Federal government

185
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,391
Or the state government has eminent domain over properties

186
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
Eminent domain of course means

187
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
Seizing people's land

188
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:37,375
This is not a popular option Republicans in particular are usually opposed to the idea of the government taking over

189
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
Private property for some ostensible public

190
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
What purpose

191
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Wake me up to get around that

192
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,543
The next challenge a massive surveying operate

193
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
You got to know what your building on

194
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,383
Duchess that would take two months

195
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
But he thinks it's doable

196
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,455
Few months a lot of people

197
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,039
Once the surveying is all set now comes the building

198
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
The Conch

199
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,903
And this is the part that Todd loves and the part that Todd does

200
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
A thousand miles long

201
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
42 V

202
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
A foot high walls

203
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
How much concrete we talking about

204
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
* 1000

205
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
Tod calculator

206
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
5 million

207
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
Lineal feet

208
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:19,103
This part took him a couple of minutes there was lots of typing he was muttering numbers

209
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,759
It would be about 250 thousand truckloads of you know the concrete trucks

210
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
It would be about 200

211
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
50000 of those trucks

212
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
Just to make the product

213
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
Just to make the wall

214
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,535
Yeah and if you could build a wall to concrete you need to reinforce it so there's

215
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,631
Some steel rebar you need as well materials

216
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:47,263
The challenge here obviously is the scale of this Singh 1000 miles

217
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
When we first started talking

218
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,639
Todd sounded like he had it entirely under control

219
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
But the longer we kept talking

220
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
What's the longest wall you've ever built

221
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,063
The longest wall that I've ever built

222
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
Was about

223
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Who am I

224
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
4 MI

225
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
But the border wall is 1000 MI

226
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
The sky understand

227
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
But you think you could do it

228
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Yes I can do it

229
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
How much would it cost

230
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,655
I mean you know

231
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,055
If it put it this way if it's done that the amount of money that it would cost would just be astronomical

232
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,895
How much is astronomical Mexico pay for it

233
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,735
So he's having Mexico pay for it he might have Mexico build

234
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
That wouldn't help you would it

235
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,599
I have my business and I'm not going to

236
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,951
Very successful at

237
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
You bet

238
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,815
Scott he has other walls to build

239
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:49,471
Noel by point out is it there is already fencing or walls along more populated section

240
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,055
Of the u.s. Mexico border I used to live in San Diego or we had a

241
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
Pretty impressive triple fence

242
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
Between San Diego and Tijuana Mex

243
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Chicago

244
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,479
In fact I remember covering up legal case of

245
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
I want the companies that help build that fence

246
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,135
They were being prosecuted for using illegal immigrant labor to do something

247
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,743
Construction Scott would Donald Trump be okay with just defense or does he want to walk

248
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,351
He talks about it as being a wall although at one of his advisers Newt Gingrich

249
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Said this week that

250
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
He's going to focus a lot of time on

251
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Securing the Border

252
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
Just what shape that takes is

253
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
Like everything subject

254
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Negotiation

255
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,271
Another thing that is still to be determined and is

256
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,575
Probably going to be the biggest negotiation

257
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
Is a is Donald Trump's threat to pull out of NAFTA

258
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:45,023
NAFTA North American free trade agreement is a 20 + year old trade deal between the US

259
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
Mexico and

260
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Canada

261
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:53,215
Trump says it's a terrible deal and he wants to renegotiate with Mexico and Canada to get a better one

262
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Or else

263
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
He said he's going to pull out

264
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
So we asked Jess Jiang

265
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,615
Going to go on a quest this week to figure out

266
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
Can Donald Trump do that

267
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,991
So I started with Chris Wilson he's from the Wilson Center

268
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,551
And he's devoted his career.

269
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,855
Studying the relationship between the United States

270
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
On the surface

271
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,927
It's not very complicated

272
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,535
The NAFTA agreement and actually have it right here in front of me is about 1000 pages long

273
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,911
Article 2205 is the section withdrawal and it's only three lines long

274
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:29,311
So I can just read it for you a party May withdraw from this agreement 6 months after it provides written notice of withdrawal

275
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Talk to the other parties

276
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,407
If a party withdraws the agreement shall remain in force for the remaining party

277
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,223
That's all that NAFTA itself says

278
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
1000 pages and that's it

279
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
Send us a note and you're out

280
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
Peace out

281
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
Seems easy

282
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Happen all the time

283
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
When's the last time the US

284
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
Has done some

285
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Nothing like this has

286
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Is left

287
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
The last time is never

288
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
The United States has never done anything like this

289
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,447
Okay so maybe we've never left

290
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
The Free Trade Agreement

291
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Before but

292
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
What about other kinds

293
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
For that question I went to Curtis Bradley

294
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,127
She's a professor of international law

295
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
She says

296
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,943
The US has left

297
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
These before

298
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Defense treaty

299
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
But this was not without controversy

300
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
And for the president

301
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
It got kind of

302
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:20,511
The most famous one is when President Jimmy Carter withdrew the United States from a defense treaty with Taiwan

303
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,071
And it was highly controversial in Congress

304
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
And there was a challenge

305
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
2

306
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
Carter's actions

307
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
Brought by members of Congress

308
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,799
So members of Congress to be sued the president

309
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
They did

310
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,639
Members of Congress I think both in the house and the Senate

311
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Suit Carter

312
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:44,063
And that case went all the way up to the US Supreme Court politicians were suing each other over

313
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
Who has the power to

314
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
To cancel a treaty

315
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
Is it constitutional for the president to just

316
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
Do this alone without Congress

317
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
And the question went to the Supreme Court

318
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Baby sleep bed

319
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
This is too political no one was harmed

320
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
We won't answer.

321
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,959
I don't even know the Supreme Court could do that just take a pass

322
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
They were like

323
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
You don't want to get in the middle of it

324
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,431
It has never decided whether it's constitutional for the president to leave a treaty without Congress

325
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,783
And if Trump pleads NAFTA there could easily be another lawsuit

326
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,135
What's interesting about NASA is it pretty easy to imagine private parties

327
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
Importers for example companies

328
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
Bringing a lawsuit

329
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
Against Trump

330
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,351
Imagining like a car factory in the US

331
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,655
That buys parts from

332
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:36,543
From Mexico exactly and now they will have to pay more or their business will suffer in some other

333
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
Way there could be lawsuits Galore

334
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,431
Every manufacturer in the US that might have to pay a little bit more because

335
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Cuz they can no longer get

336
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Cheap parts

337
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Mexico

338
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
They could sue or even a person cuz

339
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Like me

340
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Are you sad

341
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,975
So Kevin, consumer and my I don't know imported tequila cost more because

342
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
No water coming in free of terrace

343
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
I could bring a complaint

344
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,351
Ukiah died

345
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Would want to ask

346
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
You how much tequila are you

347
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
Drinking

348
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
That you would actually want to see

349
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
The president by

350
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,079
Yes if you can prove you've been legitimately harmed

351
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Then yes

352
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Yes you could

353
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,455
And so we might finally get a definitive answer

354
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
The question of whether the president has the power to

355
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Cancel NAFTA

356
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
All on his

357
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
Wouldn't there be a chance though that Supreme Court would just

358
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Again steer clear this

359
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Some say it's not up to us

360
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Weather

361
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
The president

362
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Congress unravels a tree

363
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
Yes they could always

364
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,815
Punted back

365
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
2

366
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Congress and the president

367
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
To work out

368
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,471
And that could be interesting because there are a lot of Republican leaders in

369
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
In Congress who are much more

370
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
Supportive of free trade

371
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
President Donald Trump and

372
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
His populist

373
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
Yes but

374
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,455
Also with this new wave of populism

375
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
Congress can decide

376
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
We want to be against

377
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
Free trade and if Congress and the president

378
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
Gree knocked out will be

379
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Wow

380
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:01,791
Precious

381
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,887
Trump has also talked about what he calls

382
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
Draining the swamp

383
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
We will drain the swamp

384
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:15,359
In Washington DC and replace it

385
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
With the new government of

386
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,967
By and for

387
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
The people

388
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,855
Hillary Scott the swamp is shorthand for this idea that

389
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
There is a

390
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
Corrupt group that

391
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,719
Doing favors for each other in Washington

392
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,023
The swamp monsters in this case

393
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
They are lobbying

394
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,423
On the topic of lobbyists Trump has also said he supports this

395
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
A 5-year ban

396
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:47,871
On White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service

397
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,663
Making a fortune

398
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,735
Alex goldmark has been looking into this house

399
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
Hi ya so this all seems logical enough

400
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Like who wants

401
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Big money

402
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Are there friends

403
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
Whisper into the ears

404
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,927
Yeah it makes sense

405
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,231
And it's so much I said it's one of those things that

406
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,791
The good government reform types in washer

407
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,119
Are always asking for and they just never seem to go

408
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
So I can put them up

409
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,519
I would say we would definitely want to get government circles or reform Circle

410
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
That's what you hang out with in Washington

411
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,687
What are the four friends from different areas but yes

412
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
Larry Noble is general counsel of the

413
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
The campaign Legal Center

414
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
And before that the Federal

415
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
Little bit

416
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Was

417
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
So he knows this

418
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
What did he say

419
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,743
Trump can put some restrictions on lobbying

420
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Pretty easily

421
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
I'll have to do

422
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,351
Is make his staff sign a pledge not to laugh

423
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
For five years

424
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,495
And he can make it legally binding he can just back it up with an executive order

425
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
Which if you're the president

426
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
Pretty easy to do

427
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,591
Just write it up and sign it

428
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,359
Record

429
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
There is a catch

430
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,919
Trump is not the first person

431
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:54,687
Detritus

432
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
President Obama also signed an executive orders

433
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
That was limiting

434
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
Lobbyist in Hindi

435
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,087
And he put restrictions

436
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,671
I'm hiring lobbyists into his administration and a hookah Lobby

437
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
After they lie

438
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,487
Yeah I'm in a Barbra Streisand

439
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,303
He came into office

440
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,863
We talkin about broadband

441
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
Lobbyists out

442
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,471
And they started me leaving out exemptions

443
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Is there pretty quickly

444
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Exemption

445
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
To be able to get

446
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
The best people Obama wanted

447
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
War lobbyist

448
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,735
There weren't enough people willing to take the job once he ruled out

449
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
Okay so this is the swamp that Trump is talking

450
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Government jobs

451
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,623
Pay all that much lobbying

452
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
A lot

453
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
The best people they tend to like

454
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Paid a lot

455
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
Meanwhile the White House has

456
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
Hundreds of jobs

457
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
And thousands in The Wider

458
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
So

459
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,167
You kind of limit the candidate pool when you say

460
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,359
Okay but what about the second part could Trump really stop a congressperson from leaving government

461
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
And then just becoming a lobbyist

462
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
A year later

463
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,759
Another one of those sensible sounding ideas but it is even harder

464
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,295
To pull off Larry Noble says

465
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Because he

466
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
I can't use the pledge

467
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
He doesn't

468
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Congress

469
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
He got to have a lot

470
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
Which Larry Noble said does not lie

471
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,791
And your Congress has been historically reluctant

472
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
To limit

473
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,863
What its members can do when they leave office

474
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
Inshort Trump

475
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Is going to have a heart

476
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
Stopping people from getting rich

477
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
As a matter of fact

478
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,871
Yesterday a document started circulating around Washington

479
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
DC

480
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
It had the names of

481
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
People who are going to be on Donald

482
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
Transition team

483
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
And it was filled

484
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
With lobbyists

485
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Alex goldmark thank you so much

486
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
You got it Sekulow thanks.

487
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
I just say drain the swamp

488
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,119
Raining in lobbyist that was kind of a late addition

489
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,471
To the Donald Trump repertoire promises not necessarily as high a priority

490
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,775
As the things he was talking about throughout the camp

491
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,359
And one thing you talked about from the very first day when he

492
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
Glided down the escalator at Trump Tower in New York City

493
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
What's the take a

494
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
Hardline

495
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,039
Against people living in this country illegally

496
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
He singled out those

497
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
Food come from Mexico

498
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:10,879
You said they were rape

499
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
I'm drug dealer

500
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
He refined his plan

501
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,999
Ford supporting undocumented immigrants

502
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
In October

503
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:23,935
We will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country

504
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
These are drug dealers

505
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
Gang heads gang members

506
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
Killers

507
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,687
I just got the first thing is that number 2 million

508
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:39,039
Immigration experts don't actually know where Donald Trump got that number from

509
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:43,391
I talked to a handful of people they said there is an agreed-upon number

510
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:47,487
It's about 820000 undocumented immigrants with

511
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,255
Criminal record

512
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:51,071
But in this case let's give Trump the benefit of

513
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,143
If you wanted to deport 2 million

514
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
What would you do

515
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
On day one

516
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,591
To answer this I spoke to Ben gettis he's with the American action Forum which is a center-right policy group

517
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,919
And I called them because they've done a bunch of reports looking into

518
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
Exactly

519
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,759
Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 what would need to happen

520
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
And then how much it would cost

521
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,367
Invented the first Big Challenge

522
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
Actually finding peep

523
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
This is not as easy

524
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,208
Easy as it may sound

525
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,768
If you want a good illustration of that

526
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
Listen to the way

527
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,096
We are often currently finding a document

528
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,192
The vast majority of apprehensions happen

529
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,984
Local law enforcement

530
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,544
Meaning somebody gets picked up in a traffic

531
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Yeah that's my understanding

532
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
Define people

533
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
More easily

534
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
A1 auction

535
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
Is to set up

536
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
Checkpoints in a bunch of people brought the

537
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Stop these would be

538
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,856
Checkpoints where any one of us could be questioned and asked

539
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
To show identification

540
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:52,512
Trump has said he'd like to increase the number of immigration custom enforcement officials from 5000

541
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
To 15000

542
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
You need to hire an

543
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:58,912
And train those people then says it could cost anywhere from 8 billion

544
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,704
243 billion dollars

545
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Which is a mess

546
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
Spread I mean to speak different

547
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,544
Between 8 and 43

548
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
3 billion

549
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,384
Euskara learned it the hard part here when we ask how much

550
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Going to cost

551
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,968
We can only base our numbers on the numbers

552
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
We have now

553
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,784
So you know that it's a height of

554
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Deportation

555
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
We

556
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,368
Center around 400 thousand

557
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
People out of

558
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
The country

559
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,464
Dennis doing his math based on that number

560
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,536
400001 year Well Trump + 2 million +

561
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
2 years

562
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,352
Multiply that by 5

563
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
But in between the time

564
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,824
You catch somebody who's leaving the country illegally and has a criminal record and the time you send them back to their home country

565
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
Do you have to detain them

566
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
How's it feel

567
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Jade garden

568
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:47,296
Once you've apprehended the folks and you put them in a Detention Center there still some due process

569
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
To get through

570
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,600
But then Ben get us told us

571
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,672
The last step is actually sending people back to their home

572
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,488
That's easy right by everyone a bus ticket

573
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,864
I'm not that simple while about half of undocumented immigrants are from Mexico

574
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
The other half are from

575
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
All over the world

576
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,960
And I would require

577
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
Chartering flights

578
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
Places like that

579
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
America

580
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,104
Africa Asia

581
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
All over the

582
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:18,016
Ben says if you do the math on those two million flights that gets you up into the billions of

583
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Of dollars

584
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,880
Which God actually brings us back to something I heard from everyone I talked to

585
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,928
Yes this plan is

586
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,696
Legal

587
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,488
Yes this plan is probably

588
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,256
Doable

589
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,840
It would take much more time and much more money

590
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Then husband

591
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,472
This is a bold and flashy agenda that Donald Trump is laid out

592
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
He's known for bold and flashy

593
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
He projects many of them

594
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
Costly

595
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,592
But as you say if you

596
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,616
Have the wheel

597
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,896
You could probably do a lot of this stuff

598
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:54,368
Hey guys if you got a question on president-elect Trump's first 100 days in office

599
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
