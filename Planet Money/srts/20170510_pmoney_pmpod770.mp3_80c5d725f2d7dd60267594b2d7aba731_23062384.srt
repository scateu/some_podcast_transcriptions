69
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
Small businesses went bankrupt because

70
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,960
Nobody had any money to buy anything

How did he come up with this plan

88
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,792
I started looking into this

89
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
And I kept seeing one

He would give me the same presentation he given to prime minister Narendra Modi

134
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
The one that had

135
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,879
Rock the entire Indian economy

136
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,231

High-sensitivity I have

142
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
There was a lot of poverty in literature

143
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
Why people living on less than $1 a day

144
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
Good butterbeer.

145
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:49,855
I'm uses the economic situation around him didn't make any sense there was plenty of food

146
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
Plenty of money all around

147
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,463
Are all these people who couldn't get at any other

148
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,535
It seems so unfair and so

149
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,703
And you studied engineering and got a job as a mechanical engineer he ran a team that designs specialty machines for

150
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Pharmaceutical

151
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
I used to create something new

152
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,407
So you don't Asians wear their wedding such a kind of

153
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,735
But then you'll never stop thinking about poverty

154
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,319
Is Minecraft going back to the same questions that he's had when he was a kid

155
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,183
Get a group of his engineering friends started getting together to talk about social issues

156
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,047
Sit around and drink tea and wonder why India struggled so much economic

157
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
What is the basic cause of all this mess

158
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Why this happening in India

159
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
That's so something is wrong with your system

160
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
We used to enjoy that

161
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
These guys were engineers

162
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,943
They spent all of their time making machines and systems to fix problem

163
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
So they started to thing

164
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,039
Society is a system of government

165
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,623
Something is happening in those systems that is resulting in

166
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Poverty

167
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
So let's fix the system

168
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
What is a product

169
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:04,351
So that's why we are in for sizing on the technical correction technical solution we need to have

170
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
And you got more and more into the side

171
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,263
You stay up late mapping out the process that was resulting in all of this poverty

172
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
Quality

173
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
Withdraw all these diagram

174
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,127
Just like he did when he was designing a machine

175
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
Finally he showed his works when a condom

176
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,855
And The Economist was really interested he thought it was really intriguing and he got a group of his colleagues together and a Stan

177
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
Neil to present his ideas

178
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,207
What happened at the end of The Talk

179
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,279
So it was very nice it was amazing

180
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
Standing Ovation for that

181
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
Did you think like this is what I've got to do

182
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
With my life

183
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,639
Yellow this is my duty that Destiny has given me this Tuesday

184
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
Edward 40

185
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,199
Kautz

186
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,783
Anil quit his job and started traveling all over India

187
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
Thousands of miles

188
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
Giving his talk to

189
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
To anyone who would listen

190
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:03,743
Local government officials professors business people how many times have you given it

191
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511

192
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
100 *

193
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
Thousand times

194
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
I'll get more

195
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
More than a thousand

196
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,799
A new move to the city of Pune

197
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,615
He thought it would be a good base for him it's kind of an international

198
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,199
Some of his very passionate engineering friends even followed him there

199
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
And they founded this

200
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
Devoted to these ideas

201
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Arthrogram

202
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,879
So it means the economic Revolution

203
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Is that

204
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,487
And you believe in in this revolution

205
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Yes

206
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
Archer prunty isn't very big

207
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,119
There were about a dozen members mostly accountants

208
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
And engineers

209
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,703
And they meet here at this little cafe a couple times a month

210
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
And so I joined the one more

211
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,895
Hello

212
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,503
Hello nice to meet you outside drink

213
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
Really strong tea

214
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,367
Oh yeah I would listen and talk economics

215
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
Exactly economics

216
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
You've been a member for how many years

217
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
I think I'm giving birth

218
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Lanius

219
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
9 years with long time

220
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
This is the part

221
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,215
What is the meaning of life and what should I do

222
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,031
So this isn't just economics this is like

223
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
Almost a religion

224
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,431
At this meeting and Neil is Revere

225
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
It was actually at the

226
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
And everybody kind of talked about him and he's

227
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Hushtone

228
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
Anil is there visionary

229
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
He's this inspired compassionate man who

230
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
Left his job

231
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,767
Tom devoted himself entirely to making people's lives better

232
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:46,911
Fixing India's economy

233
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,727
Our mama is the brother of your mother

234
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:56,127
So it's like your uncle and you call him up Guru Uncle group was meeting a couple times a month and year was traveling

235
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
All over India hacking his ID

236
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,759
And then in 2013 and you'll got his big break

237
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
The chance to pitch his plan to Narendra Modi

238
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,207
When I meant to be somebody was not private Easter

239
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,303
That time it was a chief minister of one province that is Gujarat

240
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,631
Still word on the street was that Modi was going place

241
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,263
In certain ways he was controversial but he was also known as a politician who made things happen

242
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,615
You actually have the ability to cut through India's notorious bureaucracy

243
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
And get things done

244
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
Moody was also known for thinking outside the box get a business background and he didn't do kind of typical pallet

245
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Kitchen things

246
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
And you have the feeling that this

247
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Might be his guy

248
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,463
So you started trying to get a meeting with Modi

249
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,023
Sophos writing emails and letters to him

250
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
Finally he got a response

251
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,119
Okay nobody will see you

252
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
You have 9 minutes

253
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
The pitcher plant

254
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
Social reception time for me

255
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
You can do this in 7 minutes

256
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,383
Annual book you flew to Gujarat with a couple members of Arthur

257
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,479
He fired up his projector and started the PowerPoint presentation

258
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
The kid literally given a thousand times

259
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
The four

260
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
The one he's about to show me

261
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
You just put your

262
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
Who's on silent

263
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,071
And just to give you an idea of how the guru Uncle rolls

264
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,863
He does not click is on PowerPoint

265
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
What are the arthakranti members does it for him

266
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
When he says this

267
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Click

268
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
And here it is

269
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
The PowerPoint presentation

270
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,567
That rocked India

271
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,943
So we're looking at a it's like an apartment building with a bunch of pipes and like the height of apartment shoes

272
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
The responsibility of God

273
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,295
It's a cartoon drawing of a high-rise

274
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Apartment building

275
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,623
Kind of a 1990s style graphic

276
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,951
The building has all these pipes bringing water into it

277
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
And the building represents India

278
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
And the pipes represent

279
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Resources

280
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,375
Resources that the Indian government is giving to

281
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
With citizens

282
00:12:54,911 --> 00:13:00,799
But the pipes in the picture are all twisted and cracked and water is spraying out into a big pool on the ground

283
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,847
And this is Niall

284
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
Is the prop

285
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,431
The gushing of resources are called

286
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Black money

287
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
A separate oldest Farmingdale

288
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
That's a paddlin

289
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Click

290
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,975
And uses these pipes should be bringing plenty of water into the building

291
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
India should have enough

292
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Tax revenue to support its

293
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
But the system is broken

294
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,655
Money is getting sucked and siphoned out of it

295
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Tax evasion and Corruption

296
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,751
The building does not have enough water

297
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
And Shadow economy

298
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Has developed

299
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
Flick

300
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,943
In the next picture of a giant head slides and next to the apartment building

301
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,759
Is smiling and wearing sunglasses

302
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,319
And sucking water out of the pond

303
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Black money

304
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
With a giant straw

305
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,183
And you see the face the size of face

306
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
It's like a huge head

307
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Is there

308
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
That's a good option

309
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,327
Book smiling and wearing sunglasses

310
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
Like a boss for mafia movies

311
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Mafia like this

312
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,007
This is the corruption that is keeping India so poor

313
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Know who is Safaree

314
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Click

315
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,871
A new character appears in the

316
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
Little hunched over man with

317
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
His hands cupped under a spigot at the end of the pipe

318
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
He's waiting for a drop

319
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
The Chi-Lites the last

320
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
Mad unprivileged Commonwealth

321
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
It is around 50% of our Papa

322
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
He's our poor farm

323
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,815
He's not getting resources from

324
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Sister

325
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
As long as the pipes are

326
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
Leaking the government will not get the money at me

327
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,727
Corruption will grow

328
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
The head will get bigger

329
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
And there will not be enough

330
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
For the poor farmer

331
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
So

332
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
How do you fix

333
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
And watch the global definition of money

334
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
I don't know

335
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
What do you think medium of Exchange

336
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
Easter definition

337
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
You look upset with me

338
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,951
Your soul

339
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,511
So just got corrected

340
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
I mean

341
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,095
You have to get rid of the big head

342
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
But for that what we have to correct

343
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,239
The black money the messed up pipes

344
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:10,079
Yes that's the solution we are asking

345
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Fart

346
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:16,991
So excited that I got a right and you'll says India needs to make the money that is flowing through its economy

347
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
Trackable

348
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Taxable

349
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Cash

350
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,087
Is not tracker

351
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
Couple is anonymous

352
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
In order to really

353
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:28,255
Fix the pipes you have to move away from cash and towards credit cards and digital payment

354
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,303
Those are transparent and traceable

355
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,887
Only then will India have enough water for the whole building

356
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,447
Only then will the poor farmer

357
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
If you share

358
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
And so and you'll conclude

359
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
Any needs to start getting rid of cash

360
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
Demonetization

361
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:48,735
So you so you should slide to Modi of that this is the simplest way we can explain

362
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,319
Did he say anything about the cartoon

363
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,391
Full nicely urologist understanding of what

364
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Plus Whitening

365
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,719
In fact booty got so into it

366
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,047
It doesn't help that the meeting went from its original 9 minutes

367
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
290

368
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
Some kind of a country.

369
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
If I get a chance I will do it

370
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
He said that you said that

371
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
The following year Modi was elected

372
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
Did prime minister of India

373
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
In a landslide

374
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,687
Daniel said he started having calls and meetings with modi's advisors

375
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
And a couple of years after that

376
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,527
On the evening of November 8th

377
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,367
Anil was at his little shared office space with some other quantity members

378
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
All the sudden

379
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
Everybody's phone started

380
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,303
Show me the food my phone wasn't ringing

381
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,863
Sing did you just see Modi on TV

382
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,399
I think he's doing your plan

383
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,007
The crazy plan that a bunch of Engineers had cooked up in their off time

384
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,823
The planet Anil believed in so much he left

385
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Job

386
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,639
His home and devoted his life to it

387
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,991
The planet Neil had showed a thousand times to a thousand different people

388
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
I just

389
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Happen

390
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087
The prime minister of India

391
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
Had actually done it

392
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,695
Is it exciting to watch it play out in real life

393
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
If you don't refrigerate

394
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
I want joy

395
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
Next fight

396
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
You call it in light

397
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
I'm in light

398
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Your light

399
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
I was not sure how to process any of this

400
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,127
The animated slides the giant Mafia head

401
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
The enlightenment

402
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,455
So I took everything to Bhaskar chakravorti

403
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,527
He's originally from India and now he teaches economics at

404
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
But yesterday I think the Indian context is is

405
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Is helpful

406
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
First on the whole spiritual aspect of Arthur crying

407
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:38,559
Bhaskar says India has a long history of Genius ideas given to People by

408
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
By God

409
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,887
He told me the story of srinivasa ramanujan

410
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,983
A young man from the south of India yet almost no formal training in math

411
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,287
And totally on his own

412
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:53,663
He came up with a bunch of really sophisticated theorems that have been done by some of the best mathematicians in the world

413
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
Been asked

414
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
He said that the goddess

415
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Spoke to him

416
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
That's nice

417
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
And gave him the proof

418
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
In many ways

419
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:08,767
People in India are actually quite comfortable being a going back and forth between science and spirituality

420
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
The lines are

421
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
Sometimes quite blood

422
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,375
They get bored here to

423
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,727
We have Christian capitalist and religious organizations that work with politicians

424
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,751
All the time

425
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:23,615
Alan Greenspan once said the philosophy of Ian Rand provided stability to his life

426
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,455
And anyway says Bhaskar taking advice from an outsider

427
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
Kind of Moody Style

428
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,039
Booty Prides himself on Auntie Lita

429
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Different kind of going with her

430
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Is got

431
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:36,415
But what I really wanted to ask Bhaskar about was the economic

432
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
He's an economist

433
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,279
And I wanted him to look at a Neal's plan and tell me what he thought

434
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,839
His first impression was

435
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
This is a really smart

436
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Really well-thought-out

437
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,215
But it is very much of an engineering

438
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,615
Approach which takes a whole bunch of different economic and social political issues and finds logical into

439
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,199
Connections among then and then comes up with some conclusion

440
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
That makes Economist nervous system

441
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
Because Economist rely on data

442
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,647
They compare one changing data set to another changing data set

443
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
It's nuanced

444
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,279
The real world is a messy place and

445
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,071
I simply putting these

446
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,863
The system diagrams on a page

447
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,471
Is not a sufficiently strong argument for

448
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Policy

449
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,799
Princeton mafiosos getting money

450
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,871
Is not a direct result of people not paying their tax

451
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,967
But you are related but it's not that simple it's not water in a pipe

452
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,831
And just because people pay more in taxes does not mean that the mafia will get less money

453
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
Or the corruption will go

454
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,439
Bhaskar says society and economy

455
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,279
It's not a machine it's a complex living thing made up of

456
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
Complex living people

457
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,911
People that you really need to take into consideration when you're making policies

458
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
That's the problem

459
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,751
So-called educated

460
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,823
Train to Columbus to Houston

461
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,151
Make use of every statistical data

462
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
I ran all of this by Anil

463
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,295
And he says this is exactly why problems like poverty never get fit

464
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,855
Economist an endless data collect

465
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
Endless speculating about

466
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,951
Consequences of every possible action

467
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,999
Meanwhile the system create poverty

468
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
More entrenched

469
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,303
And nothing

470
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,655
I was talking I just kept thinking of suranjan Gupta

471
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,471
The Grieving man who found the money in his wife sorry

472
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Annuals

473
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,543
Queen logical drawings

474
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,615
Made a mess in his life they cost him real harm

475
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
Inconvenience

476
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,343
There was some harm I mean some people lost their businesses there were people who died standing in line I mean it would know if you put

477
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Used to die in a barrel

478
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Because

479
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
You're not emotional about it

480
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
But I mean you're such a

481
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
Compassionate person I mean all of this is to help

482
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,567
The guy on the end but it it's striking me that people that struggle the most words like the little old man at the end of the pipe

483
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:04,895
I mean did you feel responsible for that

484
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,711
She's a locked new to this kind of supply

485
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,831
But they suffered more because of demonitization

486
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,560
The treatment may feel like some kind of a pence before

487
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
But

488
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
It is for the correction of Ulysses

489
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,472
This is what Modi like about his plan

490
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,264
It was a solution

491
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
Bold crazy amazing solution

492
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,152
Some of India's biggest most complicated diseases

493
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
Corruption and poverty

494
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
Nvidia will be totally different

495
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Totally different

496
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,088
A very Grateful Dead we are looking forward

497
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,648
Do this to Daniel

498
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,672
And it will hurt

499
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,232
People will struggle things will be bad

500
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
And then

501
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
The country will start

502
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,304
To heal

503
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
Poverty will end people get their dignity back

504
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
India will be the Great

505
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
Economic Powerhouse it was always meant to be

506
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:12,224
In the next episode we have part two of the story will get how a meal book kills plan

507

Play doubt we go to different parts of India talk to people in different walks of life

508
