1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,072
Quick morning there is some bad language in the show

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,168
Charlie you know that I'm from a very small town in Upstate New

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,728
Kerhonkson for Hoxie I talk about it

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,288
I've told you that Cranston

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:15,360
As small towns go he's not in economics

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,152
Powerhouse Consin is a little runt

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,040
The biggest private employer there is this old hotel called The Hudson Valley Resort and Spa

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,576
Is 8 stories high

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,392
What's the tallest thing for my you showed me pictures it's like the

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,416
White box

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
Tower rising up in the

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,232
Blue Mountain

13
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,024
Beautiful area of

14
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
But as for the hotel I worked there when I was a

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,680
The kid and the hotel was not in great shape

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,960
The roof leak

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,752
And so it smells moldy

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,288
And the carpet was this

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,128
Red orange like straight out of The Shining type carpet

20
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:52,224
And I just remembered always being kind of empty you no one really stayed there

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,368
But then two years ago I found out that someone bought the hotel they paid about 13 million dollars

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
I don't like

23
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
Why

24
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,744
Is it filed for bankruptcy just a couple years

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,512
Before

26
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,792
Who would want this place

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
To the other day I went

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Constant

29
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
To try to find out what we

30
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
What's going on

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
I drove down to

32
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:11,936
The town hall

33
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,216
To the one guy

34
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
Who buy the rules of small town

35
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
Should know everyone and every

36
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,872
That is the town supervisor Carlton

37
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
I've lived here

38
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
About home my whole life

39
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248

00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
School year

Did you go to rondout

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,832
Yes I did

43
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
Hey hey go ganders

44
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
Graduating

45
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
278

46
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,464
Class of 99 Jimmy V

47
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
Okay

48
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,864
Carl's office is very low-key it's a little brick building with a park outside

49
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
And as soon as I tell him

50
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
I have some questions about the hotel

51
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
He says I have got a story

52
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
For you

53
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
Two summers ago he says a group of guys walk into my office

54
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,408
They were all wearing suits and I'm sitting here with my blue jeans on

55
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,760
Talk about the AC hillbilly here

56
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Up against it

57
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
The A-Team

58
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
The men introduce themselves

59
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,184
They are a real estate agent and engineer and art

60
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,536
Text and a lawyer I'd say he was probably around 6

61
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
2 years old

62
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Very dignified

63
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
Balding

64
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,448
I like bald guys like myself can't you know

65
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,008
He had a three piece suit and at the time it was in

66
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312
In the summer and the suit was

67
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
Kind of a beige color

68
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,432
The lawyer says he represents a company that wants to

69
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,968
To buy the hotel

70
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,320
And they want Carl's permission to build a heliport on the property

71
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,416
Heliport yes so helicopters can land at the hotel

72
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,512
Okay so crosses all right guys which company do you represent exactly

73
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,048
And lawyer claims

74
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
They wouldn't give me any information at all for the buyer

75
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
What's which I thought

76
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
What kind of crazy

77
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
You know who does that

78
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,008
How many times did you ask

79
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,152
I mean did you say you guys can you can you like tell me off the Record

80
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
I did it several times

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,736
But still they told me they

82
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
They were sworn

83
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
To keep them anonymous

84
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,344
Eventually the lawyer finally says

85
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,928
My client is a big multinational

86
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
But that's all he'll tell him

87
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,000
So mysterious

88
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,304
Until I went to spend the night

89
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
In the Hudson Valley Resort

90
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
Okay here we go

91
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,656
Going inside

92
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,056
There's the cafe that I used to work in oh my God

93
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Good afternoon

94
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,176
Welcome to the Hudson Valley Resort and Spa I am checking in

95
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
Last name is King

96
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,528
ISO big multinational company right I wanted to

97
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,368
To find out if they had made any changes which Spruce the place up

98
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
Is the restaurant open anymore

99
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
Is the golf course still running

100
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
And then the woman at the front desk start

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
Shaking her head and backing away from me

102
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
So I had to my room

103
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Elevators on the right

104
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
And at the other end of the hallway I hear someone yelling

105
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
Is everything okay

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
The key won't work again

107
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071

112
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
Probably hasn't been updated

113
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
Since the 1950

114
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079

190
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
Hotels tourism companies

191
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Logistics firms

192
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,511
A Chinese one of the 200 biggest companies in the world with annual revenue of over

193
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
50 billion dollars

194
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
According to Fortune Magazine

195
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,399
And all of this makes me even more curious

196
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,727
Why did such a Savvy important company

197
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Buy up this run-down Hotel

198
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,311
So we called up someone who

199
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Like us

200
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Has developed

201
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Kind of an obsession with a j

202
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,991
Serious question for you is all of this as crazy as it sounds

203
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Yes

204
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
It's all as crazy as it sounds

205
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,183
Derek scissors is an expert in us China economic relations with the American Enterprise

206
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
That's a right-leaning thing

207
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Think tank in DC

208
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
He got interested in China in the early 90s

209
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:08,191
Derek was doing his Doctorate in economics and China was restarting economic reform

210
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,799
Is trying to move away from communism and toward a market economy

211
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
So Derek was traveling around China on the

212
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
So they'd see the white guy

213
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
And they say what are you doing here and I said well

214
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,783
An economist and I'm traveling to learn about what's going on in southern China

215
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,855
And every single time I said that on the train I got to cry

216
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:29,183
People would start talking other people would come to the compartment or they

217
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
Pull me out of the compartment of when asked questions

218
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,071
God to you as an economist you were drawing a crowd you're like a rockstar

219
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,679
Yeah a small stadium Rockstar but

220
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,983
Derek becomes a China X

221
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,823
And he creates this thing called the China Global invest

222
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,591
Sprint tracker

223
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Which

224
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
Track Chinese invest

225
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
Of 100 million dollars or more

226
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,015
Oh so you look at where big Chinese money is go that's right

227
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,087
At the time that Derek starts working on the tracker

228
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,647
China is encouraging Chinese businesses

229
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
To take their money

230
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
And invested overseas

231
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
Diversify

232
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,511
China had a policy

233
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
He called the go out policy

234
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,607
And the government was helping these companies

235
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
China has stayed on face

236
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,983
And they were getting very large and very cheap lines of credit

237
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
But still

238
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
Most investment

239
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
It's are not a hundred

240
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Million dollars not big enough for Derek

241
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:27,295
There were very few Investments and I could remember them all there's an uptick in 2014 partly because the Chinese government eases

242
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:32,159
Is some restrictions on big Investments makes it even easier for companies to invest money overseas

243
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
One of those companies is

244
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
Which is showing up on Derek tracker

245
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Not huge by

246
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
Is but a pretty steady state

247
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
And then

248
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
In August 2015

249
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
There's this shock

250
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
If it goes through China.

251
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
The head of the People's Bank of China

252
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
Does china's central bank

253
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,847
Mix in an ounce

254
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
It's about the Yuan

255
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
Chinese currency

256
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
He says

257
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,735
China wants the Yuan to be more

258
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
Flexible

259
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
Direct quote right Flex

260
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
Flexible

261
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Up until then China have been controlling it

262
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
It's currency pretty tightly so here's how things had

263
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:11,583
The Chinese one is packed very tightly to the US dollar so the dollar move the one just copies of dollar movement

264
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Is that the one

265
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
The head of the People's Bank says

266
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
We don't want it to work like that in the

267
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
What is it

268
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
Well for one China has some goals for the Yuan

269
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,479
He wants the one to be in a tiny group of currencies that are designated as a leaked by the international monetary

270
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Icims

271
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,599
It's like the dollar or the Euro or the yen

272
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
If you want is just

273
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,487
Copying the dollar Peg to the dollar the IMF is not going to treat it like a major currency

274
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,791
And there's something else going on

275
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,631
The economy in China is slowing down at

276
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
And unpinning from the dollar at this moment

277
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
That's going to make the Yuan

278
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
Cheaper

279
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
It'll devalue

280
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,663
Great for China because a cheaper Yuan means China can sell more stuff

281
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Which will help with growth

282
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
But

283
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
If you're holding wine you're thinking

284
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
I don't like this

285
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,367
It's going to be worth less is going to have less buying power

286
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
Let me get out of it

287
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
I want to send my money overseas

288
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
M&g investments tracker start

289
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
CNN

290
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,583
A lot of activity lot of money leaving China

291
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Well

292
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Yes

293
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
It goes

294
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Nuts

295
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,007
Chinese companies start buying up properties and Company

296
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Is all over the world

297
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,103
Because they think that soon the Yuan will buy less

298
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
So they want to buy now while it's still strong

299
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,479
When Chinese company in particular catches Derek's eye

300
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
And that is

301
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
The hna group

302
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,367
H&A has something like a growth steroid

303
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,975
A couple weeks after the announcement hna starts out on a buying spree

304
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,327
Stand up spending billions of dollars in just about a year buying steak

305
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Since I'm come

306
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
Buying other companies outright

307
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
And we're talkin about big companies

308
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Hntb

309
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
0.5 billion dollar stake in Hilton Hotels

310
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
They buy all of the raddus

311
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,943
Hotels Dubai a multibillion-dollar stake in Deutsche Bank

312
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
The drops

313
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
6 billion dollars on American Tech

314
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
These are big thighs

315
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
But remember Noel

316
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,671
What we are here for is a mystery about

317
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
A small one

318
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,047
Can I tell you what else happened right after that in the summer of 2000

319
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,167
Is it seems like an open question lots of things app

320
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
And tell me okay

321
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
What's interesting to me is

322
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
Right after that and ask

323
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
Start with maid

324
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
H&H

325
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
Came

326
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,919
To Upstate New York and they spent on the order of 30

327
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
13 million dollars

328
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
For a

329
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
Decrepit Hotel

330
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
So

331
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Does that seem too

332
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
Do you like Chinese money trying to get out of

333
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
The country into any asset is possum

334
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Absolutely

335
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,583
Alright so there's our answer Derek thinks this is why AT&T bought the hotel they were

336
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
Buying everything they could

337
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,143
Getting money out of China

338
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
And investing some of it here in the US

339
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
What's a good

340
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Yeah investment is invest

341
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
So we know why they bought it

342
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
The question is

343
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,663
Why haven't they done anything with it I was up there

344
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
And the place is still pretty run down

345
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
Still smells a little moldy

346
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,319
The red orange shining carpet is still there

347
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,135
Why haven't they put any money into the

348
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
We got some theories

349
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207

359
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,343
The question is

360
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,439
Why buy this beat up old hotel and then not make it better

361
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,999
I mean H&H has billions of dollars

362
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Okay well

363
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,327
Something else has been going on in

364
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
That has made it harder for H&A to spend money overseas

365
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
Send it in places like her haunts

366
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,287
What happened is the China realized

367
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,359
Just how much money was leaving the

368
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,271
Uh and he's not the only company that's been taking billions of dollars out of China One Chinese company bought up AMC

369
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
Beefeaters

370
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,439
Bought a 3.5 billion dollar steak in the movie studio that produced Godzilla and that Matt Damon movie

371
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,511
Great Wall another Chinese company bought the Waldorf

372
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
Astoria hearing

373
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
New York for almost

374
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
2 billion

375
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
$10

376
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
Different company paid more than a billion for

377
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Club Med

378
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
Cars taken Cirque du Soleil

379
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
We know that the government

380
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,847
Because then in July of this year just a few months ago

381
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
The Communist parties

382
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
Official newspaper published

383
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
A front page APA

384
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
Very unusual

385
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
Warning about

386
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Gray

387
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
Rhino to gray rhino

388
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
A Green Rhino is a

389
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
Problem on the horizon that you

390
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,231
But you don't acknowledge it until it is trapped

391
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
Abed said

392
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,863
China's got to watch out for gray rhinos in our economy like

393
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,167
Companies taking on too much debt

394
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
Making food list

395
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
And not long after that op-ed

396
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
China started to

397
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Weasley

398
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
These companies

399
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Here's Derek's

400
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
They didn't shout from the roof

401
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
We are imposing very strict Capital controls

402
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,319
This is like HMA getting a smack on the head and being told a guy

403
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
You're done that's right

404
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
And not just a Janae Lots

405
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,975
China has always had Capital controls and it sort of

406
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,047
Tightens and loosens the flow of money whenever it's having

407
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,703
Feelings and China does seem to be having some feeling or does this summer Chinese police detained

408
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
Did the head of the company that bought the Waldorf

409
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
Pistorius

410
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,311
The company that bought AMC Theaters

411
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,383
Had to publicly deny that their chairman was in Custer

412
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,431
They started selling off assets

413
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Emphasis where you see

414
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
So

415
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:53,343
Clearly the confusion over what kind of economy China want

416
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
You companies are

417
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
Biggest capitalist success stories

418
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
The government supported them

419
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
And now it wants to rain them in

420
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
So where does all this leave hna the little airline that

421
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
It became a giant

422
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,447
Will a couple weeks back hna makes a weird mood

423
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,751
This man comes forward out of the blue

424
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
And he says

425
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
I need Chinese largest

426
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,359
Shareholder and I'm transferring my shares

427
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
Which is a third of this comfy

428
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
Into a charitable foundation in New York

429
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,039
Could you imagine Delta Airlines

430
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,343
Right age and they started as an airline saying

431
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,183
Hey we were this airline that charge people as much money as we could

432
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,767
But you know what we're going to do instead we're going to turn ourselves into the United

433
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
That's the equivalent to what hna said

434
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,679
There is no concrete explanation for what they're doing

435
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,263
But this move did highlight some things about hna

436
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,103
Including the fact that nobody really knows or understands

437
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
Who owns this company

438
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
Which ring some real alarm Bells

439
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
Some banks are refusing to lend to hna now

440
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
And look this company is

441
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
Massive

442
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,135
And they're investing a lot of money in the United

443
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
And no one really knows what they're up to

444
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,767
I mean they know what they're up to

445
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:11,679
But we try to talk to you

446
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,239
You guys and this week H&H seemed

447
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
Like they had agreed to an inch

448
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:21,151
But then they backed off and said maybe a statement on tape and then they backed off of that and changed it to

449
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,455
Suggest an email everyone is very busy

450
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,783
Yes we did email we emailed about capital

451
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,575
Controls and the odd move with

452
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Charity

453
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,159
But right up at the top or making questions work

454
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,255
Where did you hear about kerhonkson New York and why did you buy this hotel

455
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
Hni got back to us

456
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,863
They did not answer any of the other questions but

457
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
They did say some things about the hotel

458
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:50,591
Hna group views the Hudson Valley Resort as a very desirable destination

459
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,639
For leisure travel and business

460
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,295
We're proud to be an employer in the kerhonkson community and grateful to operate in a local economy

461
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
Flash

462
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
Skilled hospitality

463
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,159
Professionals my hometown

464
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Okay

465
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:11,583
Not bad. Very desirable destination for leisure travel them on

466
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
I mean I am not trying to knock your hometown

467
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
But can I say something here

468
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
H&A is a multibillion-dollar

469
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,823
Which we have to assume means they're pretty smart about travel interest

470
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,175
And make me some give me some good plays over the past couple of years

471
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
Some really big

472
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Please

473
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
Yasso

474
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
Maybe they just haven't had time to focus on this one

475
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
Vacuumed it up along with all the other big stuff

476
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
And forgot about it

477
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Preserved

478
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
Actually maybe that's what's keeping it going

479
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:47,167
Bingo and you know the night that I stayed there it eventually did get kind of packed you remember Louis from the start of the

480
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
Line dancing

481
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
Find a cussing

482
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Just line dancing Louis

483
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Red Knight

484
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,871
Who invited me down to the law

485
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,431
And you know we're in the middle of the mount

486
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,735
Tens and there is nothing to do outside

487
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,527
But inside the hotel

488
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
The atmosphere was so

489
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,927
There were these two young guys sitting at the piano playing with journey song

490
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,279
And it made me think about everything that this little hotel has

491
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,607
Use somebody gets a bad feeling in Beijing

492
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
M Hudson Valley Resort doesn't get a new car

493
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:24,287
It's at the very end of this long chain of decisions about currency

494
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,847
And aspirations of the Chinese government

495
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,431
And it seems like maybe H&H is forgotten

496
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,223
And in the meantime it's a lot of

497
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,551
I mean that night they never open the restaurant

498
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,111
But someone had brought in a bottle of wine and pay

499
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:38,879
Paper cups

500
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,439
And we're all sitting around laughing and yakiyan

501
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:46,303
And then somebody starts blasting country music on the speakers

502
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,351
And somebody taught me how to do a line dance

503
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,911
I'm not a very good life answer is what

504
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:55,519
And to be honest I could not think of a nicer place to spend the night

505
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,663
We have a lot of people to thank for today's episode

Each week we ask the questions

527
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
What does it mean to be human

528
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,823
And why do we do what we do

529
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
Listen long as we find the answer
