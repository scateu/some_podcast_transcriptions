Encouraging Californians to use less energy whatever pops

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,984
Because it all adds up

00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,008

Professor Schierholtz can you hear me

9
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,736
And I'm going to just warn you I'm like on the

10
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,552
Very very Talent

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
I

12
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm on the end of a cold

13
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,160
50 people with cold

14
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,440
Talking

15
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:35,072
Heidi Schierholtz was Chief Economist at the Department of Labor for a good chunk of the Obama in

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,376
She's with the think-tank now called

17
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,656
The economic policy

18
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,472
Is partially fronek policy

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,776
Is partially funded by labor

20
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:48,384
I wanted to talk to her about something that is happening in the job market

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Right now

22
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
Has hit

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,248
3.6

24
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
Percent

25
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,296
Which means that

26
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,344
Of all the people who want to work

27
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,160
And are able to work in the United States

28
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,720
Just 3.6%

29
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
Do not have

30
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,304
That is the lowest unemployment rate

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328
In almost 50

32
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,376
How do you says

33
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
Cause unemployment is so low

34
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,728
Workers are starting to find themselves

35
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
With this

36
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
Almost like

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,032
Superpower

38
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
The

39
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,616
Quit threat is good

40
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,896
Is that a real term

41
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,688
This is the kind of thing economist

42
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
Wood name

43
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
Yes it is

44
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,272
Oh yeah and I'm not

45
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
Sure what the hell

46
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Actual

47
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Name is

48
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,880
8 Cuda look it up and I'll get back to you

49
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:35,744
I did check and her colleagues agree this should be called the quit threat though there is not currently seem to be

50
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
But the general idea is

51
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
If I go to my boss

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
And I say

53
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
I might

54
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Quit

55
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
That threat

56
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,216
Becomes more and more realistic

57
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
The lower unemployment

58
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
The chi

59
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Logic of this

60
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
This is exactly what anyone on this

61
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,688
If your employer knows that you have

62
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Decent outside.

63
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
They have to pay

64
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
Better wages to

65
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,880
Their workers at the pay better wages to get the workers that they need

66
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,416
And we know you know

67
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
The difference

68
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,024
9% unemployment rate in an 8% unemployment rate

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Means a lot less

70
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,328
Two workers

71
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
As far as the economic leverage goes

72
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
The difference between a 4% unemployment rate under 3% unemployment rate so there is definitely some nonlinear

73
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
Moving towards

74
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
Full employment means for

75
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,736
Non-linearity etc etc this is

76
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
A beautiful mathaway

77
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
I'm saying

78
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
For the first time in decades

79
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
Kind of suddenly

80
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,696
Workers

81
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720

Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Kenny Malone

84

Today on the show what does Full Employment or near full employment

85
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
Actually look like in the real world

86
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
Our colleagues at NPR's businessdesk have spent the last few months all over the country reporting a series of stories

87
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
Json full employ

88
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,808
And today we are going to hear about three of those story

89
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
How bratwurst

How some workers are still being left behind

92
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,072
And what happens when a city's unemployment rate

93
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
Hip 1.5%

94
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400

All right before we get to the stories about what's happening in the United

118
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,911
States right now there is one sort of wonky but

119
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,983
Really interesting thing I talked about with Heidi she

120
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
And that is

121
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
What do economist

122
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
When they talk about full employment

123
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
It's pretty straightforward so

124
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
Full employment

125
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,503
Is the lowest level of unemployment you can get

126
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,343
Without sparking accelerating inflation

127
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,743
And that link between unemployment and inflation might not be totally clear to everyone to let me just

128
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Yeah verify

129
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
If the unemployment rate is so low

130
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
That

131
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,447
For employers to be able to get and keep the workers that they need

132
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
They have to raise wages

133
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,799
Higher than they can reasonably absorb

134
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
So that they then have to raise

135
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
Prices higher and higher and higher

136
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
In order to cover those costs that's it

137
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
That's how low unemployment

138
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
Can lead to accelerating inflation

139
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
So we are currently at

140
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
3.6%

141
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Unemployment

142
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
Is that full employment

143
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Well this is the opened

144
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
Heidi Schierholtz for example says

145
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
What you know

146
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,375
Wages are starting to go up but

147
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
Inflation is not out of control so

148
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,751
She thinks there's still room to get unemployment down

149
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
Even further and

150
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
Wages up more safe

151
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
Some people think we are already at

152
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
This is kind of beside the point

153
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,039
Because what isn't controversial is that we are either at full employment or very

154
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
That puts us in a moment where power

155
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Is shifting

156
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
From employers

157
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Two workers

158
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,511
And here to tell us one story about that shift is

159
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,071
NPR's economics correspondent Scott Horsley Scott things

160
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,935
Scott I like to think of you yes and economics correspondent but

161
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,543
You are the person I think looks most like Anderson Cooper at the NPR

162
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Oh I disagree

163
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
I

164
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
The story Scott

165
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
Is going to Palace actually starts a while ago

166
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,271
Back when unemployment was still really high

167
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
Scott went to Sheboygan Wisconsin

168
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
To visit the

169
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
The colder fat

170
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
They make a lot of

171
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
High-end kitchen fixtures bathroom fixtures are they there a big company that they also make things like lawn mower

172
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:33,983
They workers at color are represented by the United Auto Workers Union and there's a union hall

173
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Where I met up with

174
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
The woman who is the

175
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
The star of our show Courtney Herring Heering I actually

176
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
All the finished products and faucets

177
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,319
In. Any unfinished brass

178
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
And I move them around to differ

179
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
And when she started out she was making she told me

180
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
Between 11 and 12 bucks an hour which

181
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
She thought was not a terrible picture gallery for that for that time

182
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
But as time went by

183
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
She found out that they were people

184
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
When doing very similar jobs to hers

185
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,263
We're making about twice that much you really did open my eyes

186
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
To see what was really happening and how much of an opportunity I was actually missing compared to what I actually thought I was gay

187
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,527
But once you knew was it a little bit

188
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
It was an eye-opener it was a huge eye-opener

189
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
It made me realize

190
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
Oh man this is a huge gap

191
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
So what is going on

192
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Why is there that she

193
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Yu-Gi-Oh opening

194
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,351
So couple years before Courtney started working

195
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,423
Color in the midst of the Great Recession

196
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
Kohler like a lot of

197
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
Employers

198
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
Had adopted what's known as a

199
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Two tiered wage structure

200
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
A two-tiered wage

201
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,175
In an effort to save money

202
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
The company rather than cutting everyone's pay says okay we're going to leave your pay existing workers where it is

203
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
But anybody who's hired

204
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
From this day forward

205
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,511
Is going to get paid a lot less and maybe have worse benefits as well

206
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
Twitter something that we talk across the economy

207
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,631
When unemployment was higher when employers had more

208
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
More power

209
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
It wasn't Universal but it was it was common among some big industrial companies some of the

210
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
Most famous were the big three automakers

211
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,455
Crew sweater two-tiered weight scale during the recession Kohler did caterpillar did

212
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
Lots of

213
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,807
Unionized industrial companies adopted this so-called

214
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
Two tiered wage structure

215
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Union membership in general

216
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
Has been on the decline

217
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
For decades

218
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
It's but

219
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
Even for the existing union members

220
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,047
Great Recession

221
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,863
And the resulting 10% unemployment

222
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
Gave employers Leverage

223
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Over workers

224
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,799
Yeah I mean I talked to union members who were at Kohler in 2010 when the

225
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
Two-tier wage contract was adopted

226
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,455
They didn't like it at the time but they didn't feel like they had any power to

227
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Negotiate

228
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
An alternative

229
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,855
Are they were afraid to go on strike unemployment with sky-high companies

230
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
We're closing their doors all around

231
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
People are getting laid off left and right and

232
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,303
They didn't let the workers who were there at the time didn't feel like this was

233
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
An opportunity for them to drive a hard bargain

234
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,191
Back in 2010 there was a lot of what Economist call Slack

235
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
In the labor

236
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
Market slack basically just means

237
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,823
It's easy for employers to go find someone else to

238
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,175
Dell course unemployment has been dropping for years now

239
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,735
And Scott says everyone's been looking

240
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
4 signs

241
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
Status Slack

242
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Has gone away

243
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
Anything about slack is

244
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
If there's a little slack or a lot of Slack

245
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:36,255
It's kind of the same result I mean if you think about your your dog walking along on the leash

246
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,143
If if there's a foot of lease dragging on the ground or 3in of these dragon on the ground as long as there's a little bit of Slack

247
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
It it feels the same to you and the dog

248
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Right

249
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
It kind of happens all at once

250
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,591
Like when your dog suddenly pulls tight on the leash

251
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
This is what it means that slack is nonla

252
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,967
When unemployment drops from say 9

253
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
To 8%

254
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
It's not like workers

255
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
Really have that much

256
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:04,927
More power like okay you want to raise there still 9000 job and you're

257
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
Probably still not going to go fine

258
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Find a job

259
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,255
But a drop from

260
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,279
4% 2

261
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
3% now that

262
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
Is a tightening labour

263
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
Market approaching full in

264
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
Workers have

265
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
Actual

266
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,799
Quit threat power and that's what that supposition the Kohler found themselves in

267
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,127
Last year they had a lot of job openings they couldn't feel

268
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,199
They had existing workers who were defecting to

269
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,527
Neighboring factories like Sargento Cheese and the

270
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,319
Johnsonville Brats company

271
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,623
Yeah right nearby

272
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
It's A Feast for the senses

273
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
Can-Am I couldn't but

274
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:43,839
Those those companies we're hiring workers away and suddenly Kohler was in a less competitive

275
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Position

276
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,679
It when it came to attracting and keeping good workers

277
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,335
The slack had suddenly evaporated and when the slack was gone the workers wouldn't wear a much stronger position to negotiate

278
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
The new contract

279
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
In mm

280
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
Teen the union got Kohler to

281
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Close app

282
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
Pretty significant portion of that

283
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Tier Gap

284
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,575
And then as the labor market tightened and tightened

285
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
Further

286
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,903
They were able to renegotiate again

287
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
In 2008

288
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,255
18 before the old contract was even up

289
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
And fully closed

290
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
The two-tier structure

291
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,631
And as a result you've now seen

292
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
The newer worker

293
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
Grayslake Courtney Herring get a nice

294
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
Bump in their pee

295
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,335
Courtney said it really made a difference in how she and her fellow workers felt about

296
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
What the work they were doing

297
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,711
I mean I was told don't go in a factory don't go on a factory you're not going to have a life there

298
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,015
It feels like I do and I'm getting somewhere

299
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,087
So I could see myself being here for my career

300
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
My family's been in it for

301
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
At least 40 plus years so

302
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,743
I like the kind of continue that tradition

303
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
That said Kenny

304
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,583
We have to acknowledge there are some counterexample

305
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,703
Pause I mean even in this tight labor market for example UPS just negotiated a new contract

306
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,311
That puts new drivers on a lower pay scale than older drivers

307
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
There is a locomotive plant in

308
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,199
Pennsylvania where the new owner is trying to impose

309
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,015
A two-tier wage scale on employees there

310
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
I that case

311
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
Still in mediation

312
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
So it's it's

313
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,951
Not a uniform picture across the country with Eric certainly caveats to it

314
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,047
But the broad outline is worker certainly have more bargaining power

315
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,095
To demand better pay and better benefit

316
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
What's today

317
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Then they did

318
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
At the height of the recession

319
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
All right

320
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
Scott Horsley thank you very much

321
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Alright and Anderson Cooper may have

322
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,847
Complained rink bring he can send them to me

323
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
Full employment or quasi folder

324
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
He's making things better for workers

325
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
We're just going to take a moment

326
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
To talk with my colleague Jasmine gar

327
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
About some of the problems

328
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
We still see

329
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
Jasmine thank you for be

330
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,631
Here to rain on your parade

331
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
The reality of the

332
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
We wanted to talk to Jasmine because for NPR's

333
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:03,615
Full employment series she had been looking into unemployment within the Hispanic

334
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Hispanic

335
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
Is the term the Bureau of Labor

336
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
Did employment rate for Hispanics is 4 point

337
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,575
That's fairly close to the national average that seems

338
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Distance good

339
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
It's at a historic low

340
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
Okay it is

341
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
Always good for there to be more

342
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Jobs

343
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
But there's layers

344
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
So you have to peel off

345
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
And look a little deeper at

346
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,679
And Jasmine says what that picture shows is that wages

347
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,727
For Hispanic and Latino workers

348
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Are still relatively

349
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,335
Weekly median earnings are about 75

350
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Percent what they are

351
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
R4 white work

352
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
Annotating labor market hasn't

353
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
Medigap worse it hasn't

354
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
Made it better it just

355
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,295
Was and still is

356
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,111
Oh yeah I mean like look Hispanic Libra

357
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
It still comes in

358
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Rated in low-wage

359
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,463
A lot of that has to do with it

360
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Educational attainment

361
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
It there still

362
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
Alive even though it's been growing next

363
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Financial aid

364
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
They're still alive

365
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,191
Done for immigrant communities a lot of it

366
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
What is language

367
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Depending on

368
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,079
Status of immigration status you know if you

369
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
I have an irregular undocumented

370
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
Status in this country

371
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
It is going to be harder for you to go to Europe

372
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Employer and say

373
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
I want a raise

374
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,343
And Jasmine says there's a similar point to be made when you look at

375
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
African American

376
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
It is

377
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
Very low by historical stand

378
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
But

379
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,535
It is still very high 6.7%

380
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
More than double the white

381
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Again

382
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,935
The tightening labor market hasn't made that got worse but

383
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
It hasn't really made it

384
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
Better either

385
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
It just still is

386
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,823
Yeah my point with these two numbers is

387
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,151
. there good it's always good to have left

388
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
Unemployment

389
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
Are 4.2% for Hispanics

390
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,807
6.7% for African Americans

391
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
That's great in a hiss

392
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
Historical context

393
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
But it's also indicative of others

394
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
Systemic problem

395
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
The tighter labor market

396
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Doesn't

397
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Change

398
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,839
Discrimination it doesn't solve races

399
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
Jazmine Garcia

420
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,335
After James Reeb was murdered in 1965

421
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
There was a national outcry

422
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,687
The back of the scene of the crime in Selma Alabama

423
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
People responded different

00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
What happened

425

All right the US unemployment rate is

429
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
Is 3 point

430
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
6%

431
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
Extraordinarily low

432
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
But there is a city where the unemployment rate

433
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
Is 1 Point

434
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
5 /

435
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
What does that

436
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Even

437
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
Look like

438
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,151
The answer that question here with me now is my colleague

439
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Rollie who

440
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,735
Is a correspondent on the business desk and also

441
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,783
I had the unfortunate pleasure sitting next

442
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
To the Planet Money

443
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
Team we are very loud

444
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
This is my

445
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
Formal on Mike apology

446
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,487
This is New York so where you stay

447
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
Jimmy went and visited the city

448
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
The lowest unemployment rate

449
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
31.5

450
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
What city is

451
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
Well I went to the city of Ames

452
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,567
Iowa catches about 40 minutes north of Des Moines

453
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,711
Yes right right it's a small City maybe 60000 people

454
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,783
Why didn't new buildings there there's an older

455
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
Downtown Wichita

456
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
Very pretty very quaint

457
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
So Jim driving into Ames

458
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Is it

459
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Can you see

460
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,791
That there is 1.5% unemployment like are there signs that something is

461
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Is different here

462
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,631
Well yeah you see signs all over the place saying Help Wanted

463
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:16,031
Three little girls absolutely yes yes I've been restaurants bowling alleys and bars

464
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
Everybody's looking for workers

465
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,127
Windows

466
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,711
So why Ames Iowa Welch Jim says

467
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,015
Cities with research universities like

468
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
Iowa State

469
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,599
Tended to recover better from the Great Recession

470
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
Ames is adding job

471
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Good high paying jobs

472
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,231
Tech Healthcare in other growing fields

473
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
That's part of why

474
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
The other part

475
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,887
Is the Eames needs to attract people to fill those job

476
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
It is not San Francisco.

477
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
It is not

478
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
New York

479
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,311
Iowa has a relatively stagnant population

480
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
It is not attractive

481
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
People at the rate it needs

482
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
To feel those jaw

483
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
So that's it

484
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,479
Combination that's that causes

485
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:01,087
It means you have a I have a worker shortage and so sure this is affecting the higher-paying field

486
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
James is also seeing this

487
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,927
With in service industry like a rest

488
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,279
Oh yeah when you have I'll let you know when you have a lot of

489
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
Well paid

490
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,607
Jobs

491
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
That are filled by

492
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
Educated people

493
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
Who make good salaries

494
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,591
You know that tends to filter down through the economy as a whole it's worth stepping back here

495
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
2 Note

496
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
Did those workers in lower wage jobs

497
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
Are benefiting the most

498
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
When the labor market

499
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Gets real

500
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Because

501
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,087
If you're in some highly specialized

502
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
Rocket science

503
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
You already have a lot of

504
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
If you quit

505
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
Your employer is going to have a harder time finding

506
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
Another rocket

507
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
But

508
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
If your job is

509
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
Is bussing tables for example

510
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,703
Your boss can go and find a new employee

511
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
Train them up pretty quickly

512
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
And replace you

513
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,847
But it 1.5% unemployment

514
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,943
There isn't really a new person to go find and train up and so

515
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,759
Waiters and table bussers in this world

516
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
Have a lot more leverage

517
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
And Jim says

518
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,135
You can see this play out better than anywhere else

519
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,671
In Ames Iowa

520
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,695
In those

521
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
Help Wanted signs all over

522
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:16,607
So I said it was driving down the highway and I saw a lot of these signs and I stopped

523
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
At 1 restaurant

524
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,727
Which actually turns out to be sort of a venerable institution in the aims

525
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
Hickory

526
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,079
Hickory Park Restaurant company and we're off

527
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:31,711
Full-service Family Restaurant we serve a smoked food we also went in and I met with

528
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
One of the managers

529
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,527
Elizabeth kopetsky

530
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
They had a sign out

531
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
Front that said

532
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:42,719
Help wanted all chefs that sign we have never hung sign out in front of our building ever

533
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
Until the last 2 years

534
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:49,887
But that sign says help wanted all positions and in your saying that's been there for a little while

535
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
USB just kitchen

536
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
But now it's like all position

537
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
Everybody's in the same boat

538
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
Liam last your head

539
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
A call from a restaurant down the street

540
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:03,455
Asking if we had an extra staff that they could share that's how bad it's getting what did you tell them

541
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
We didn't have enough for ourselves

542
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,855
That's what I told them I was in another restaurant with another work

543
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,183
Worker and she was a manager but she was having to fill in at the dishwasher

544
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
Filling with the Castro

545
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:21,119
I wait tables drawing of somebody bouncing 18 different cups on like one finger

546
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
Brandon on the other hand I've got platters in a cash register

547
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
This is what

548
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,239
1.5% unemployment look

549
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,799
Yeah I mean if you are looking for work

550
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,567
In

551
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
A place like games

552
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
Especially if you have a good

553
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
Resume

554
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,943
IUD basic

555
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
We have your pic

00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,087
I mean I want went into one restaurant and I'm and I met a woman named Tanisha

00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,927

I'm a manager at the other store so

560
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
She

561
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
Had lost her job

562
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Last November
