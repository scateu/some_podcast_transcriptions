1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,072
Shear engine is in it and

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,120
Is 32 years old

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,912
And he lives in rongcheng China

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,984
It is a city of around 700 thousand people on the E

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,800
And he says it is a really nice

6
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,104
But like any City it has its

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,872
Issues

8
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,152
The traffic for instance

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,432
Has always been totally cray

10
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,064
Would not give way to pedestrians

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,392
And sometimes when they saw people crossing then they will

12
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:33,536
Break all of a sudden and the cause a lot of accidents exactly for example the car behind what

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,840
Bump on to the car in front of

14
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:40,960
The show the fender bender we spoke with Ron Jon through our producer ecowatt

15
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,776
Rain chances being a pedestrian was just

16
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,544
Terrifying

17
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:48,128
You basically just have to hurl yourself across the street when you saw a break

18
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
In traffic

19
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,176
You know hope for the best

20
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:56,320
But now after the changes have happened to the cars and it will wait for you

21
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
The changes that have happy

22
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:02,976
Have to do with the implementation of a new policy in China called the social credit score

23
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,560
Cities like wrong turn or testing out a version of this system

24
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,120
And the planets it'll be in place all across the country

25
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,656
By the year 2020

26
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,728
The social credit score is similar to the credit score we happy

27
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
And the idea behind both

28
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
Best

29
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,872
In a big complex economy you have to do business

30
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
With strangers

31
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,712
And you want some way to know whether or not you can

32
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,808
Can trust them whether they're going to pay back a loan whether they'll be a good tenant if you rent

33
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Apartments

34
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
Weather

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,136
The Advil they're selling you is

36
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
You know

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
Advil

38
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,952
And not Imodium

39
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
Say

40
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,096
It does not be super rough

41
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,424
China does not have a traditional credit score

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,472
And this has been causing some problems

43
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
White people not paying back loan

44
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,592
And not really seeing any consequences of not paying back

45
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,920
But just imposing a credit score system was tricky

46
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Because here's the thing

47
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Many Chinese citizens

48
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
Don't have

49
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
A credit history

50
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,600
A lot of Chinese citizens don't even have Bank

51
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,696
So when China set out to make their trust score they kind of leapfrogged over

52
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
Credit score and came up with something broader

53
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
More sweeping

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,864
The Chinese social credit score will measure things like whether or not you

55
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
Cologne

56
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,936
But it also includes Behavior

57
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
Like how you act at work or

58
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
Whether you obey traffic

59
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,640
Turn up giving way to people were crossing the traffic light

60
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,688
Your points will get deduct

61
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
Forget the noise of a fender bender

62
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,808
If you don't yield to pedestrians in wrong turn these days

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,368
You might not be able to take out a home loan

64
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Get a good seat

65
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
Train

66
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,280
And if your social credit score is low or if you're one of the people who doesn't pay back a debt ordered by the

67
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,120
The court you could end up on something called a list of untrustworthy people

68
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
R The Blacklist

69
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
Right now The Blacklist is in effect Nationwide

70
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
And people on The Blacklist can't get a credit card

71
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:54,080
They can't take out a loan or open a bank account

72
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,408
Not to mention a whole other raft of restrictions and humiliation

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
For instance in some parts of China

74
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,016
If your on The Blacklist and someone calls your phone

75
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
They will hear this

76
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,512
That is a recording Bass

We are the hosts of Planet money daily podcast the indicator

And we've been doing a lot of reporting on the indicator about China's social

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Credit system

88
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:40,160
The China is building a giant system to measure how trustworthy its citizens are

89
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,000
This system will reach into almost every part of daily life

90
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
It will determine things like who can get a loan

91
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,840
Give me the country

92
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
You can take an airplane

Kgf someone tracking our data and using it to make judgments about us

94
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
That's nothing new

95
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
We know that companies do it we know the government

96
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,920
But China social credit system will take all of that to a whole new level

97
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,736
It is changing how people shop how they socialize

98
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
How they behave in traffic

99
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,088

Rachel emphasizes that this is

140
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,559
Fiction but you says the show make some really smart point

141
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,631
Points about a system where people have a kind of centralized rating

142
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
Live and die by

143
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,239
That we are familiar with a centralized rating

144
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Credit score

145
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,127
But how do you build a system like this in a country where a lot of people just don't have much of a

146
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Credit history

147
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
Well you can find records

148
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
The people's behavior in other areas

149
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,271
And extrapolate trustworthiness

150
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
From that

151
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,367
And no Cardiff who has lots and lots

152
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,671
And lots of data on how people behave

153
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207

166
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
A lot of

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
How people spend

168
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
And borrow

169
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
And how much money they like

170
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
We have

171
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
So do other private

172
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
And the government is partnered with some of them to share data

173
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,863

Does Rachel says

176
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,239
It's unclear how much data or what data

177
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
Alibaba and other Chinese

178
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
These are sharing

179
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
With the government

180
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
Or how the data is getting

181
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:16,479
The way people escorted is not somebody with a mr. bill it could be what they buy online

182
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
It could be

183
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:24,927
Like a low-cut dress well it's not far from that I mean I think these on pools

00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
So your school will go out but if you

188
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Buying video games

189
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
You're lazy

190
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
ECU school will go down

191
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
Nappy

192
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Yes

193
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,311
It sounds so much nicer than

194
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Of course

195
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,455
Of course his data collection and the weird assumptions it companies make based on our actions

196
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
Does happen in the US and everywhere else

197
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,063
Rachel says it with different China is hausa

198
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,111
Severe and comprehensive the consequence

199
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
We reached out to

200
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
The Chinese government by the way but they did not respond

201
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Request for comment

202
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
Social credit score will not be all about

203
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
What you buy

204
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,143
The government is also collecting data of its own

205
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
And that did it will Factor

206
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
People social credit

207
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
It's worse to

208
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,359
And we got a glimpse into how this might work because pilot cities around China have already been testing out there versions

209
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Of the system

210
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
One of those cities is wrong.

211
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
Where are it engineer

212
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,039
And he says the dad about him has

213
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
All been bundled together into a single

214
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,927
So in a system everyone starts out with a score of

215
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:29,951
1000

216
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
What did she want

217
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
Insolvent

218
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
So he's still got a thousand by the way you can get more than

219
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,471
It's true there's a whole letter grade 6

220
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Whitesell from 962

221
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
1000 + points

222
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Is an a

223
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
850

224
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,991
959 points is Abby 8:49 to 600 is

225
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,295
See and this is considered a warning letter

226
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Blue bat

227
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
You are a dick

228
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
You're labeled an untrustworthy City

229
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,695
Like it's really hard

230
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
You can gain or lose points for all kinds of read

231
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,303
Get a DUI

232
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
That is an automatic downgrade to Abby

233
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
Get into a spat with your neighbors

234
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
-10 points

235
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Give to charity thing meaning

236
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
What's 5.

237
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
And if you spread rumors online minus

238
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
50 point

239
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,151
Forget to clean up after your pet

240
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
-10 points

241
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
Keep track of all this

242
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Neighborhoods have designated

243
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Watchers

244
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,575
People who keep track of neighbors Behavior

245
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:33,439
Update people's scores all monitors that they used to have in Greece

246
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
School now they actually have

247
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
And it is real power

248
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,911
Because if you have a really high score you could discount and a bunch of local businesses

249
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
Your heating bill goes down

250
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
You get some cable channels

251
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
Including a soap opera Channel

252
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Indica

253
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Weather Channel

254
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,871
You also get special invitations to community event

255
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
If your score is low life gets pretty hard

256
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
No invites

257
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
No free kung fu Chan

258
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,087
Also you might not be able to get a promotion at work even if

259
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
You've been doing a great job

260
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
You just won't be eligible

261
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,487
And all this is for the mind blowing and you can kind of amusing to hear about

262
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,559
But there are some very real consequences to this system

263
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631
One person who is experience them first-hand

264
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
Is a man named loud

265
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
He's 42

266
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,495
And he asked us not to use his full name because he

267
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,055
She could get in trouble with the government for talking to them

268
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
Loud one used to work in

269
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
In the coal industry

270
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
Few years ago the price of

271
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
The coal in China

272
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
Plummeted mycashflow

273
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Cut off

274
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,719
Because the money was just gone into

275
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
Smoked loved one would buy

276
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
Tons of coal from

277
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
Coal mines and sell it to energy

278
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,095
Eplans it needed

279
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,143
But then the Chinese government change

280
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Used its energy policy

281
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
And so the price of cold tank

282
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
Allowed one was left with Warehouse

283
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
Full of cold

284
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
He could no longer

285
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,615
Sell red wine about himself in terrible

286
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Geode various creditors

287
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
One and a half million dollars

288
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,735
And one of them took him to court

289
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
Loud one told the judge

290
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,343
I just don't have this money I can't pay back these loans

291
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
But the court disagreed

292
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,927
And put him on China's dreaded

293
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
Blacklist

294
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
Bankruptcy does not occur

295
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
Just in China in the same way that it

296
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
It does in

297
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,143
Us allowed one wasn't really sure what being on The Blacklist men

298
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,727
He just knew that he wanted to get back on his feet and get a new business going to

299
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
To pay off those debts

300
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Nicole business was dead

301
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Loud wanted

302
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
Very successful

303
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
Any still had good contacts

304
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,687
He decided he would go to Beijing

305
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
Hit up some of those contacts

306
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
And figure out a new

307
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,807
So loud one went online to book

308
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
It was a high-speed train to Beijing

309
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Put his name in

310
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
Payments

311
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
Right away this page popped up

312
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
Thank you couldn't complete the

313
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
This person

314
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
Is on the untrustworthy list from the cards

315
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
Last one was confused

316
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,263
Why couldn't keep up the train ticket

317
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,543
He started looking into

318
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
The black

319
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
The Blacklist have been rolled out

320
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
Before the full search

321
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Credit score

322
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
But it will be part of it

323
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,063
It started about five years ago and it does involve cracking down on debtors

324
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Creating consequences

325
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
For people who do not pay back

326
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Are loans

327
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,695
And allowed one discovered

328
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
One of those consequences

329
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
He could not book a high-speed

330
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,119
Dancing that comes along with

331
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,447
The Blacklist are untrustworthy listings that you are

332
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Fart

333
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
High-end

334
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Consumption

335
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
Which means

336
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
That you can't take

337
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Speed train

338
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
You can fly

339
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,991
Flying to Beijing bus one says take 90 minutes

340
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,551
But that's considered luxury travel so he can do that

341
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
He would end up instead taking the slow train

342
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
To Beijing which is

343
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
14 hours

344
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,999
And loved one was blocked from booking a lot of hotel rooms in

345
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,815
Because that was considered a luxury expense

346
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
Trying to start this new business

347
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Began to feel

348
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Impossible

349
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,007
The way to new business has been already blocked

350
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
I'm allowed one went to his bank

351
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
He found it all of his accounts and cards

352
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Have been frozen

353
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
One morning

354
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
When loved one was driving through the center of town

355
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
He discovered another aspect

356
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
Being on the entrust

357
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
On what are the electronic Billboards by the side of the road

358
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,999
Was his face slick up on a big billboard

359
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,071
Electric screen

360
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
By the side of the big Plaza

361
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
There are like

362
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,239
Huge screens and you can really see them from afar

363
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:36,895
I saw my my pictures on that screen picture from my ID card and my ID card number

364
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
And my name

365
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,735
The billboard said this man is untrust

366
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,807
Loved one says these Billboards are all over town

367
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
But once he started to feel self-conscious

368
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
All the time

369
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
I'm really hard to go out

370
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,047
Ever since that I actually intentionally reduce

371
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
Eye contact with

372
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,631
Weather outside world

373
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,471
And also I try not to go

374
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,287
To this get-togethers With Friends

375
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,687
Why do you do that why do you until I am afraid that people would look at you from a in a day

376
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,015
Different way and I don't feel confident anymore

377
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
Bloodwine says whenever he went out

378
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
I never did see the billboard

379
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
Can we just stop and watch it

380
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,695
Scrolling to the untrustworthy

381
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
Waiting to see if

382
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
His face with come

383
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
The one day when he was doing that

384
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,631
I saw the face of someone he knew for one of them

385
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,703
Speed walking

386
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,751
The same industry as I did

387
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,799
No I'm there

388
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
Lisa been successful business

389
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
White Cloud wine

390
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
And now they were the same

391
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Position he was

392
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
So he called some of them up

393
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
Started arranging dinner

394
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Where they could all meet up

395
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
And talk

396
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:51,647
He says the other people on The Blacklist are now the only people that he can really relax or

397
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:58,559
So what I thought was actually a widespread attitude towards us is very resistant

398
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,607
People that was Hank why

399
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
Are you sure being happy

400
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
Why do you still have time to be happy

401
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,311
Why do you not go out and make money to pay back your loan

402
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,943
So far loud one says he has paid back about 300,000 of the 1 and 1/2 million dollars

403
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Originally owned

404
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
So still about 1.2 million.

405
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
How long do you think it will take to pay off

406
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
The rest

407
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Acquiesce

408
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,327
But even when loud one does managed to pay off his debts

409
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
Getting off The Blacklist

410
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Could be hard

411
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,215
We talked to lawyers in China who deal with this by all accounts

412
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
Getting off The Blacklist

413
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,287
Even if you paid your debts

414
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
Well it's technically possible

415
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
But it just never seems to happen

416
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
We reached out to China Supreme Court about the

417
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
But they didn't respond to requests for

418
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,135
But loud one says he will keep paying off his debt he has to believe there's a way off this list

419
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,695
Meanwhile China is moving towards the

420
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
Full rollout of the social credit

421
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
And by 2020 the system is meant to be in place

422
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
All across

423
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
What's the country

424
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,679
After the break we try to understand what this all will mean for

425
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
China's economy

426
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
And Ford City

Okay Stacey when we are trying to evaluate the

439
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Is social credit

440
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
System that China is Middle

441
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Rolling out

442
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
One thing we talked about a lot

443
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
Is it it just feels kind of creepy

444
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
Neighborhood Watchers watching

445
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Everybody's every move

446
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Undeniably

447
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,551
I mean at least you us but when we talked about this was she run John the 32 year-old it engineer and Ron Chen the pilot

448
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
What city

449
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,391
He told us to him the monitoring does not feel creepy

450
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,743
Becky says that it's made people act better like he used to be someone who

451
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
Did not stop for pedestrian

452
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
When he was driving

453
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Not have done that

454
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Now.run John says

455
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
He always stops

456
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
And you just feel better about it

457
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,383
In fact he thinks the system is a kind of step in the evolution of societies

458
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
And people living together

459
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,503
Where the needs of the community are put ahead of the needs of the individual

460
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,111
Who have become more friendly

461
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,927
I think in the history of human

462
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
Being developing towards

463
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
Like communities

464
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
If everybody can follow the rules

465
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
I'm sure it's

466
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,655
It's very good for

467
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703
You know every individual living in the city

468
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
On the other hand

469
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,519
What are the reasons

470
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,567
The system gives so many people a lot of

471
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
Pause

472
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
The Chinese government will almost certainly be using it to

473
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
To try and control

474
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Is population

475
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
Even more than it already does

476
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
The bolster it

477
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Empower

478
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Remember one way

479
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,135
To lose a lot of points in your social credit score

480
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Is to quote

481
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,207
Spread rumors online

482
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
Most definitely

483
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
And you don't the whole time that we've been working on the series

484
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,375
I kept thinking about this one little scene from The Black

485
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,703
Episode and I know that it's fiction but it really stuck with

486
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
With me and I haven't been able to shake it

487
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,055
It's the scene where the main character is

488
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,359
Practicing her laugh in the bathroom mirror

489
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,943
She's trying really really hard to seem happy and joyful

490
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
So the people will like her and give her a high rating when they interact with her

491
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,207
Part of all this that I find the most troubling

492
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,583
Is that it makes emotions like anger or frustration or even sadness into a

493
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,423
Kind of suck the authenticity out of human interaction

494
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
Punishes people for

495
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Being Human

496
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,519
For their own Humanity

497
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:05,343
Episode please check out our show the indicator from Planet Money posted by

498
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:11,743
It's 10 minutes or less comes out everyday and you hear stories like this one or on the psychological impact

499
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
Recessions or implied or stuff like why the price of Fritos is going up in the White House vending machine even though horn price

500
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
You're going down

501
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Really interesting mystery to solve

502
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
Oh yeah but we we did the indicator is produced by constanza Gallardo Echo Fang and dharius Rafael
