1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,816
Some of us were really hoping

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,608
Let this presidential

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,424
This time we would hear a serious

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,448
Discussion

5
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,472
About economics

6
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,776
We've got two weeks ago

7
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,848
Before either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump elected president

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
And it's

9
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,896
Just not

10
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,920
Going to happen

11
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:22,784
They are not going to talk seriously about two different visions

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
For the economy

13
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,856
I'm going to be fair to these

14
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,880
Two candidates

15
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,440
You do see this drink every president

16
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,816
4 years ago when President Obama was running for re-election against Mitt Romney

17
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,376
We decided to come up with the perfect

18
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,656
Planet Money Canada

19
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
Candidate

20
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,728
The Economist would love because

21
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
And it would talk about the economic issues

22
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,872
Here is that show from 4 years ago as relevant

23
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
Today as it was then

24
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,176
You're going to hear me

25
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
And Alex

26
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,528
Do they have a show we are talking about

27
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
Presidential

28
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Economic

29
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Platform

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,624
There's a mystery about the

31
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
To us here at Planet Money

32
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,696
Yeah he's with strange

33
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,768
We talked to Economist academics policymakers

34
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
All the time

35
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,096
Enter there is a lot of disagreement

36
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,192
Among them about what to do about the economy and vac we highlight that disagreement

37
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
Every week here on Planet Money

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
There is

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
Actually surprising amount of stuff

40
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,848
Bitdegree on

41
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,384
The wide range of Pontiac

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
All across the political Spectrum

43
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,272
They think our policy no-brainers thinks that the experts agree

44
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,296
Should be on

45
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
Any presidential candidates economics

46
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,392
What's an African we convene

47
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,464
A panel of economic experts from across the political Spectrum

48
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
And we ask them

49
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,328
What do you all agree on what should a candidate propose as part of

50
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,608
The economic agenda

51
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,400
And we come up with our own

52
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
Green plant

53
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:48,032
And we learn exactly why no actual politician who wants to get actual vote

54
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
Ever listens to the advice the experts

55
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:57,760

All right if we come up with a dream presidential platform we need

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
Dream Team

68
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
NBA Dream Team of Economist we need a

69
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,856
Super fancy intro

70
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:40,256
From the center for economic and policy research in Washington DC weighing in on blogs and articles are round

71
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,536
Globe economist

72
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Dean Baker

73
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,352
You could probably describe his left

74
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
Dissenter be fair

75
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,704
Spectrum from George Mason University

76
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
Russ Roberts

77
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:54,080
The grand spectrum of Economic Policy I'm a pretty hardcore free market

78
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
Die

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,408
Probably called a libertarian

80
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,712
Playing the center of the spectrum Catherine Baker

81
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,296
I'm a professor of Health economics at the Harvard School of Public Health

82
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
From across the ocean

83
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
Do the University of Chicago

84
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
Luigi zingales

85
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
What I like says I might

86
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,768
Pro-market but not necessarily probiz

87
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,864
And finally rounding out the panel from Cornell University

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,936
The Economist so nice they gave him a first name twice

89
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Robert Frank

90
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
I'm a registered Democrat

91
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
I think of myself as a radical pragmatist

92
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,992
This is an incredible line of experts from the top of the field from all over the ideological spectrum and if you were

93
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
Would have come up with an idea that they all agreed on

94
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
You would think

95
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,648
This might be an idea you'd want to propose as a candidate

96
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
Running for office

97
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
And it's not a mythical Quest

98
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
We found six

99
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
6 major changes to our economy

100
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:52,192
Pretty much the entire panel sign off on the six plank economic platform that every single

101
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,728
What about panelist signed off on

102
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
That started here

103
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
With the tax code

104
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
And we're not talking about little tweaks to the tax code

105
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,944
A percentage point cut here in that Raider a bump there in that right

106
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
No to a person are panelist Ed

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
The tax code in this country makes

108
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,392
Fundamentally no sense and needs to be completely over her

109
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
The simplest thing

110
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:19,839
Is silver a overall reform of the tax code in the direction of eliminating

111
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
All the loopholes and differences and in particular the docs

112
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
That was Luigi zingales

113
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
And I do feel Alex

114
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:33,407
Like I do actually hear this line o simplify the tax code close loopholes eliminate waste that sort of thing for presidential

115
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,503
Right but you ever actually hear people say which loopholes they would like to eliminate

116
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
No they're usually not very specific

117
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,135
It sounds good to say I want to close a loophole

118
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
But yet remember every loophole every deduction

119
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,023
Has people voters I should say who benefit from it

120
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
All the deductions

121
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
As a history and Anna

122
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Explanation

123
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
But even if I might

124
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:01,567
I think some of them are useful like the chargeable deduction excetera I think that the only defensible line

125
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
0

126
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
So you should not be able to deduct

127
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
Chatham

128
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271
All them all the deductions gone

129
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:15,135
And you know this man that time that crazy to people that cuz it cuz I think what people think alike

130
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,975
Tax deductions loopholes missing some Corporation or some rich dude getting a sweet deal

131
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
But the biggest of these deductions

132
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
The biggest one

133
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,887
Is the one that most of us wouldn't think of a loophole at all

134
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
And so

135
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
Planet Money presidential platform

136
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
Like number one

137
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
Eliminate that.

138
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
When did you know I think just

139
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,175
If I say you know the common sense the way we have it is it is the mortgage interest deduction

140
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Mortgage interest.

141
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Mortgage interest is a QB

142
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,343
Extremely woodgrass informal taxation extremely perverse

143
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,439
I hate to hear this because like many Americans I have a mortgage

144
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,999
And I do write off the interest on my taxes

145
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,607
And Alex actually know exactly how much it saves me cuz you know I do that TurboTax thing and you can

146
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Click and unclick

147
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
Parts of this program

148
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
And I figured out

149
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,751
Exactly what the mortgage interest deduction saves

150
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
$5,000

151
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
That is

152
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Not nothing

153
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,663
Yeah but you know I feel

154
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,063
Sm1 in middle-class that this is not a bad thing and I feel like this is an encouragement for me to own a home to participate

155
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
My community in Brooklyn tonight

156
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,415
Polluter you know throw trash on the ground

157
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,231
I believe that this makes me a good resident of United

158
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,071
But from an economist's point of view this is $5,000 that the government is

159
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
Arbitrarily giving you and other mortgage holders over other people in society so I don't have them

160
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
But I live in my house

161
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Community

162
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,103
Don't get any special

163
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
Text Ruben from the government so it does seem a little unfair

164
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,735
Enter conversate such as unfair it's actually

165
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Distorting

166
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,623
There mountains of Papers written on all the bad things that the mortgage interest deduction does

167
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
For one thing are, said the bigger your mortgage

168
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
The bigger the tax break you got

169
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,559
The Richer you are the more money the government gives you back

170
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,143
He was a liberal and a conservative Dean Baker and Luigi zingales

171
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
It just makes no sense that

172
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,031
You know if we have Bill Gates or whoever some very wealthy person

173
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,103
We're subsidizing them to get an expensive home

174
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,687
So because which people receive a much larger subsidy

175
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
If the price of houses

176
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Increase

177
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
So much that

178
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
It actually makes less affordable for the poor people so

179
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
It is really perverse form of

180
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
And by the way this is not a secret

181
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
The mortgage interest

182
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Direction

183
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,447
Everyone knows about it a lot of Economist on record as saying it's a very bad idea somebody should come along

184
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
I try to get rid of header pics

185
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,311
I'll tell you why in fact I will show you why we're going to bring an actor

186
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,895
We're going to put in some Applause and some Reverb we're getting ready to try out

187
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
Presidential platform plank number one

188
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,807
That's why

189
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
When I'm elected

190
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
President

191
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
Of the United

192
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,487
I have a special plan for the middle class

193
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
All of you American

194
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
Who own your own home

195
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
I promise

196
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:09,471
How to raise your tax bill by $5,000 of dollars a year

197
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Yeah.

198
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:19,455
Going to explain that actually makes things Fair overall it it gets rid of these distortions in the

199
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Housing market

200
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,807
And we've all seen what kind of problems distortions in the housing market could cause

201
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,647
It'll probably actually lower housing prices for people who want to buy houses

202
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
In the future

203
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:34,047
And in fact the government will be bringing so much money that was formerly given back to you and all your

204
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
Mortgage holding brethren

205
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,399
That maybe could actually lower taxes on everyone a little

206
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:43,263
Explorations little hard to fit a bumper sticker but I think we go with it that's like number one

207
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,311
And if you like that you are going to love

208
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,383
Plank number to which involves another deduct

209
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
A deduction that made in b-more distorting

210
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
In the first one the mortgage interest deduction

211
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
Okay if you have a job

212
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
The pace for your health insurance

213
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
And you are benefiting from this deduction right now

214
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
And you might not even realize it

215
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,975
But a panel of economist

216
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,303
Be immediately zeroed in on this as something that is got to

217
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,119
Deduction for employer-provided health care

218
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,959
The way we handle it right now is it if you get health insurance through your job

219
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,287
You don't pay taxes on that benefit the way you would on your wages

220
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,103
And your employer doesn't pay taxes on that benefit

221
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,967
Okay I bought some people there this is a little confusing because to not economist

222
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
This is a very obscure point

223
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
But usually at work

224
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
Think about your salary

225
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
If someone asks you

226
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,463
How much do you are and you say you know whatever $50,000 a year

227
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
But

228
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
That's what your entire compensation

229
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,119
The company is actually giving you something else of value health insurance

230
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,447
Which frankly when you look at it is like giving you money

231
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,823
But the IRS views these two forms of compensation very differently they tax you on the dollars you get from your salary

232
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
But they don't tax you

233
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
On that other form of compensation your Healthcare benefits

234
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
And this is the key that

235
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
Text your employer either

236
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,599
Remember your employee does get taxed on the salary they pay you

237
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,647
So you may think it wisest problem

238
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,975
We don't have to tax everything in life and I think we can agree that

239
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
Having health insurance

240
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,791
Is a good thing why should we tax

241
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Yes but have you ever heard the phrase

242
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
Too much of a good thing

243
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Here is Catherine Baker

244
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,935
Panelist and Healthcare economist

245
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
Some people actually have

246
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Too much health insurance

247
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,823
And that's a controversial thing to say

248
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
But if you have health insurance

249
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
That covers

250
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,967
Everything under the sun with no co-payments

251
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,319
You would be completely reasonable to say while I don't care how much

252
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,135
Benefit the MRI will give me if it gives me even if

253
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,695
Tiny little bit of health benefit I want it

254
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
So when health insurance

255
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
Completely insulate

256
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
People from facing any

257
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,887
Price of the care that they consume

258
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,935
They start to consume health care that has

259
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,519
Lower and lower and lower value in terms of producing health

260
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
And the question is

261
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
Should federal government

262
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Pax

263
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
That should the tax code

264
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
Subsidizing

265
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,807
Extra extra extra care thus producing lower and lower and lower health benefits

266
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,879
When those monies could be going to alternative uses like

267
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Education

268
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
Lenoir housing

269
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
Or welfare or National Defense

270
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,071
So you're the problem if employers being encouraged by the tax dude

271
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
Spend more and more money on

272
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Cadillac Health Plan

273
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
That drives up the cost of healthcare overall

274
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,775
Which just makes it more expensive for everyone

275
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
Including people

276
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
Who don't have Healthcare through their jobs they are priced out of the market

277
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,479
So all this discussion we have about health care costs going to the roof we heard over and over again

278
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
And everyone wants to blame somebody okay blame the insurers

279
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,855
Play in the doctor's appointment trial lawyers

280
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,671
What are Converse a part of the blame

281
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,767
Is this ridiculous deduction which amounts to a huge subsidy

282
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
To an already bloated help

283
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
All right look good are fake presidential candidate

284
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
It's always talking about those of you

285
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,567
Regional Healthcare

286
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,871
I understand that's your problem

287
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
But I alone

288
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
Tackling a problem

289
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Equally as

290
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
Those of you

291
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
With too much health

292
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
And so I pledge

293
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Costlier

294
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,255
And more restrictive health plans

295
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
Foremost

296
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
Working American

297
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
And that's why no one Alexa

298
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,495
It sounds crazy to say I have the solution

299
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
Horizon Health

300
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
Care cost

301
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
Text your health insurance been

302
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
When you say it out loud

303
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
It sounds wrong

304
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,783
But the crazy thing about this particular provision in the tax code

305
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Is that it

306
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Inefficient

307
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,159
In driving use of healthcare that really has questionable value

308
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
And it's inequitable

309
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
I'm imagining fake voters

310
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,839
Streaming out of our fake Auditorium in which our fake candidate

311
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
Is toxic they don't even want to hear this

312
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,423
But fortunately you know

313
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Plank 3

314
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
I think it's something that people can get around a massive

315
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Tax cut

316
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
Okay are you ready yeah I texted that Sin City is text itself everywhere in the American economy it destroys jobs

317
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,039
Stop synovation I am all for it okay who gets the text but

318
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
Yahoo

319
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,135
What for being Blue Sky hair

320
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
I would say the corporate taxes

321
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
Totally awake

322
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,535
The the corporate income tax makes no sense whatsoever

323
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:29,215
You are killing the voters here so far we got raise taxes on the middle class and eliminate taxes on

324
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,823
Incorporation those are the two most liberal members of our panel Dean Baker and Robert Frank

325
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,383
And here's the reason the day and pretty much all our Palace

326
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
Hate the corporate income tax

327
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Which by the way is

328
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
What are the highest

329
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
In the world here in the United States at 35

330
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
It doesn't make sense related tax

331
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,623
The corporation as such what we want to do is to

332
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
Did someone commit Ronnie

333
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,279
What we care about is if the corporation is reinvesting the money

334
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
What's wrong with that why do we want them

335
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,191
Prevent why do we want to prevent the corporation from investing the money what we might want to prevent is

336
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
You're giving the money to wealthy shareholders or than buying a second or third fourth home getting a new Mercedes every 6 months

337
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
Whatever my feet

338
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:12,735
That's where we want to have the taxes we don't want to prevent Microsoft or General Motors whoever might be

339
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,063
I'm investing more in improving their product line that's that's a good thing in my

340
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,111
So a lot of people

341
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:21,695
Meaning when they think the corporate tax they want to keep the corporate tax in place because

342
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,999
They want rich people to pay more taxes

343
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:30,399
And rich people owned corporations right but our panel agreed if you want to tax rich people and not all of our Palace Madrid

344
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,447
By the way that you should text rich people more than

345
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Other stitches

346
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,287
But if you did if that's what you wanted to do just text rich people

347
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Do that

348
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Don't text the corporation

349
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Okay

350
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
Like number three roll it

351
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,199
I say

352
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
Read my

353
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Lips

354
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
No taxes

355
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
For Corporation

356
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
0

357
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Nada

358
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Nothing

359
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:58,815
Alex people are streaming out of the doors of our fake Auditorium they're literally turning out the lights on our candidate

360
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,887
What wait wait hold on

361
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Not done

362
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
There's more

363
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
You're going to like this

364
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Something else

365
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
I'm

366
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Proposing

367
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
I promise

368
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,407
To eliminate all income

369
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
And payroll tax

370
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,343
Okay okay there's there's something we can sell

371
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
Yeah and it's not just pandering there is good solid economic reasoning behind plank number for getting rid of the income

372
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
Income tax and getting rid of those payroll taxes

373
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
The taxes on your

374
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
How to check data

375
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
Here is registered Democrat Robert Frank

376
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:41,823
Taxes have two effects they raise revenue that's the one we're focused on here but they also have a second effect which is

377
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
To discourage

378
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
The thing that you tagged

379
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,943
We tax income for the

380
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
For the first of the two effects

381
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
TurboTax because it's an easy way to raise revenue

382
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
But if you if you ask

383
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,647
Is income a Bad Thing should we do

384
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Discourage income

385
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
Answer no

386
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,815
That's not a useful thing to do at all right and the payroll tax is another offender

387
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
How is it that creating a job

388
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
Is a harmful activity

389
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
It's not harmful it's

390
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
Absolutely beneficial

391
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
Why do we want to discourage that

392
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,847
When there are other things that we

393
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
Could and should tax

394
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Even if we didn't need

395
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:23,807
So clearly there is a problem here the government gets most of its money from income tax

396
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
And although at least

397
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
What are members

398
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
Russ Robertson

399
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Your general direction

400
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,767
At least he wouldn't have too much problem with shutting down most of the government

401
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,607
The rest of them and that they all agreed there needs to be some form of

402
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
The question is

403
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
What to pack

404
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
Not most of the panel

405
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:45,567
If you ask them they would say some form of a consumption tax now this is a tax that

406
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,615
Embedded in everything you buy

407
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,175
And I should say as an aside Dean Baker heat he was

408
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
Not in favor of Kentucky

409
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
Taxi says too hard to make it work

410
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:59,391
But everybody else was in support of it and had interesting clever ways of making it Progressive so that rich people and yeah

411
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,695
Owners would pay a bigger share of the tax burden and

412
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
People struggling to put food on the table with Payless

413
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,839
And just to get enough money to keep the government running there is another type of tax

414
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
That are cannabis love

415
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:14,751
And it fits into a theme that we've been sort of dancing around with all these other planks in our panel

416
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Which is

417
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,567
If you subsidize something

418
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:23,967
You get more of it this is a basic principle of economics if you provide a deduction for somebody if you make something tax

419
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,807
Free people will consume more of it sometimes more than you want

420
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
And here's the flip side of his principal

421
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,415
If you tax something you get less of it

422
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
So, say

423
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Let's

424
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Use that

425
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
To make

426
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
The world a better place

427
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
Here's Luigi zingales

428
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,423
Things that would be useful to

429
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,239
Introduce at Woodway Economist call

430
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,311
Gucci and Taxation which is taxation of

431
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
Bad things like

432
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
Smoking is considered

433
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
Damaging to

434
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
Housing Authority of yourself and others

435
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,087
And so we tax it to try to

436
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
Force people to internalize

437
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
The cost of the put

438
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,951
NWI Savannah what are the worst

439
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
Things that the things that are causing the most

440
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
Problems in the world right now

441
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
Pretty clear

442
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
Pollution carbon which is causing global warming

443
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,935
You got to check that

444
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Crazy Taxi

445
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
Gasoline rays

446
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Pollution of all forms

447
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Tax

448
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,359
Energy use or carbon emissions

449
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,687
In a way that reflected the cost of the environment that we all share

450
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,991
Let me work work causing damage and we

451
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
You know we can't seriously tonight

452
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,831
Now I should say are libertarian

453
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,879
Russ Roberts he rolled his eyes

454
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Abyss

455
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Ethiopia

456
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:40,255
No practical questions like how do you get the size of the tax rate

457
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
And how do you enforce it all around the world which

458
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,911
As we know winds blow over from China if you're going to do this you have to do this worldwide

459
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
But even with all those disclaimers

460
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
Russ Roberts set

461
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
The environment

462
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Is one area where I

463
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
The case for governor

464
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
Is the strongest

465
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
Cathay spillover effect

466
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,407
Are most obvious

467
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Alright so

468
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Even our libertarian Russ Roberts

469
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Sort of onboard

470
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
Hitfit presidential candidate

471
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,879
When I'm sworn in on day one

472
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,951
I have a word of advice for the American public

473
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
Make sure you have

474
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
Full tank

475
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Gas

476
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,911
I promise to raise the price of gasoline by 60

477
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,263
$0.70 maybe more whatever it takes

478
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
Done

479
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,847
Frumcrazy

480
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
So crazy

481
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,711
It just might work and there's a point at which

482
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
Kidney defense

483
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,831
So many people he's either completely off the rails or

484
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Maybe

485
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
He's telling the truth

486
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Maybe

487
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,999
He's saying things that may be painful right now

488
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,303
But provide the most good for the most

489
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,655
People think that the United States has to hear things that may have been special interest

490
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
But

491
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
We need to hear

492
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
Well if you like

493
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,079
That kind of bold Proclamation I present the final plank

494
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:04,735
Remember this is from our team of highly respected dignified economic thinkers from some of the leading academic institutions in the country

495
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
Country flight number 6

496
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Illegal drug

497
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
Make them legal

498
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
We spend a huge amount of resources

499
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:14,207
Does putting people in jail and try to catch him and discourage him all does his make

500
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
Got some nasty gang members rich

501
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
And

502
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:23,935
We waste a lot of resources on putting them in prison which is just a luxury form of Hotel I mean it's it's a crazy

503
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
Crazy system we have right now that make

504
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
Next time we can all make sense but I think it also makes

505
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
Action.

506
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:35,199
Ashley crazy policy I mean we should be looking to to decriminalize you know drugs like marijuana or

507
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:41,855
In my view probably much less harmful than alcohol on the ideal we have people spending years in jail and we have

508
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
Illegal we we have home

509
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,487
Underground system of

510
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,559
Supplying these drugs you know crime syndicate that

511
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,095
What's the drug that acts like crazy

512
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,143
Eros reforming the whole tax system

513
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
That's going to be tough

514
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,471
Showplace 6 legalize marijuana

515
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
How to take the edge off

516
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:07,199
Thank you thank you thank you God bless you and God bless

517
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,599
United States of America

518
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
I love our fake president

519
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,072
But you don't

520
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
If you think about this

521
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
If you think that all economist

522
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,936
Sabri on like the platform

523
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:33,312
Serious for a moment

524
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:40,480
All of our kind of do actually agree about that and you'd think that at least some form of these recommendations would make it into

525
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
Canada flag

526
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,296
Yeah you would think that but

527
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,136
This very little overlap between R panel and the real presidential

528
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,464
It's it's like this is political

529
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,840
Poison like you just can't say yeah I'd be open to talking about eliminating the mortgage interest deduction

530
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,144
Why not let's talk about it Economist agree with

531
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
And this is

532
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
Perks that right we have the six

533
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Plank plant

534
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
Always respect and they agree to it

535
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:11,712
And it deals with some of the biggest challenges that we face as a country in a rising healthcare costs

536
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,272
Competitiveness fairness climate change

537
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,088
And yet you can't play any of these ideas out loud

538
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
Robert Smith Here Again by the Met

539
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Your radio in

540
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Thousand

541
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,400
16 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have not

542
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Yacht suggested

543
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,704
Did the changes that are cotton

544
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Put together

545
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,776
Clinton and Trump are not going to get rid of

546
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,312
The corporate income tax

547
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:38,848
How to lower it

548
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
You're not going to get rid of

549
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,896
Payroll tax

550
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,176
The market interest

551
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
Action still

552
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
No one

553
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
We'll talk about that

554
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,064
The only part of the platform of the candidates are so close to adopting is

555
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,160
Some form of legalizing marijuana they both seem on board with metal

556
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,184
Medical Marijuana but

557
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,720
They're not exactly ready to have

558
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Pot for sale

559
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
At the corner store

560
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,816
There is one character that has come

561
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
Pretty close

562
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
To adopting the Planet Money

563
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Presidential

564
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Economic life

565
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
And that is

566
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
Gary Johnson Gary Johnson

567
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Libertarian party

568
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,288
He appears to support

569
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
5 out of

570
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
6

571
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,152
Proposals it's a little bit hard to tell me mortgage interest deduction

572
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Because great job

573
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Says he wants to do

574
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,968
Get rid of the entire

575
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
So I assume that means mortgage

00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Pinterest

577
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,088
The only thing he disagrees with

578
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
The Economist on

579
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Is

580
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,160
Taxing carbon emission

581
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,208
He does not want to see tax on carbon

582
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,048
So what does this economic truth did Gary Johnson

583
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,120
I looked at the RealClearPolitics polling average currently

584
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,424
5.8% of Americans

585
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
So they will vote

586
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
