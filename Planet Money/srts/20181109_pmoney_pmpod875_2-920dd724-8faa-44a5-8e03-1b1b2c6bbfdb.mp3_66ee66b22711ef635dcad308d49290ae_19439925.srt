00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,032
He's wearing a dress shirt jeans boots and a beige cowboy hat and his right hand is wrapped up in the

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,944
Just lost part of his thumb

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
I got the dog in the with the rope and went off they put it back together but

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,744
I wasn't able to fix the whole fingers I lost like the tip it happened during a competition

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
That sounds like a rodeo but it's not really a rodeo

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
Rodeo is the same but it's a little different you throw the rope into

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,944
Horse running in front of you try to get the to the 2x + C

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968

Wrapped Around the Horn of the saddle and there's so much friction from

00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
The horse

14
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,720
Pulling away

15
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
That the leather starts

16
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
Smoking

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,424
Smoking is really fast and I cut my finger in into the rope and the saddle

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,288
You got there so

19
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,616

Thousands of acres of land they rmx

29
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,024
Sticking cows are born in May

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,864
To go but a lot of them have American dads

31
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,168

River Ranch in New Mexico

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,752
I like my angles to be short

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,592
And their bellies to be really close to the to the ground

35
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,408
And you can find that easily in Mexico

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968

00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016

Filled with

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Potential

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,328
Chilled to a perfect negative 70 degrees

00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,032
He picks up a cooler full of sperm straws

48
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
Throws them in the back seat of his pickup truck

49
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
Takes them across the border through Mexican customs

50
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
South on Highway 45

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480

This part of the twelve desert

88
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Incredibly harsh everything

00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
The great advance in Mexican Ranch

98
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,175

99
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,967
That they got plenty of land

100
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
It might not be

101
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Be the best

102
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,575
Pasture but ranchers let these calves

103
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
Live off the country they don't have to

104
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
To spend money to

105
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415

Nibbling on wild grasses

108
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
The scrubby plants

109
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
Jose Luis doesn't keep

110
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447

And

114
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,591
There's only one way to get there

115
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
These cows

116
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:41,759
Have to walk across the border it's a long annoying Journey for these cows

Security

119
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111

00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:07,871
There's a big building right there and Cowboys start herding the cattle into this building

129
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,407
The cows walk in

130
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Single file

131
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,223
USDA agents are inspector

132
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
One by one

133
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:19,135
Amato's poor unsuspecting cows walk out of that big building they called on a shoe

134
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
And land in a pool of water

135
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,023
It's a tick bath that does not happen at JFK

136
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
At least not yet

137
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
The cows

138
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,679
Scramble to get out of the water and they Shake themselves off like what

Just making sure it's just cattle what is crossing the US Customs and Border Protection agent

146
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855

Pickup truck

148
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415

150
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255

00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Huge heavy sliding door

154
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
For a little bit they're kind of in

155
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
No man's land

156
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,055
Then they tried writing the United States

157
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,383
End up in a long narrow pan that's basically a big scale it

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
It looks like a flatbed truck

159
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
And here is where they get sorted

160
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
And Wade

161
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,551
This is the Sorting shoots right here

162
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
They sort of cattle and sizes

163
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,487
400 pounder is 507 tenders and that's how the Mexican Cattleman is fate by the way

164
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
And by the time they go out

165
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,351

What else is opening in the border France

177
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
There might not be as big a ranch

178
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Chihuahua

179
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,303
Beef on both sides of the board would probably be more expensive

180
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
Cattle and beef

181
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Currently move across North America without any

182
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,167
Tariffs or quotas

183
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,239
The same used to be true for Hogs but pigs

00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
Things got caught up in the rain

185
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287

Us and Mexico over

187
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
Steel tariffs

188
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
And Mexico put at 20%.

189
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,479
But at least for now the cattle industry has managed

190
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
To stay out of the

191
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,087
Jose Luis sells each of his for about a hundred bucks

192
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,719
Which is interesting because anyone will tell you these cows will be worth a lot more in just a few months

193
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:37,375
The reason these cows make the journey to the United States is because of decisions made in Washington and New York

194
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
By bankers

195
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Feeding cows

196
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
Corn and Alfalfa and

197
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,031
Weeds until they're ready to be slaughtered is

198
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Expensive

199
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
Renters usually have to borrow money

200
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
To feed their cows

201
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
And

202
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
It's just cheaper to borrow money in the US

203
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
The finance in Mexico it's not as cheap

204
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
That's what it is in the US

205
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,647
They do lend money but it's out of very high on

206
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
So you can

207
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,999
Really compete with that

208
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
This is William Wallace

209
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
The 4th generation

210
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Cattle rancher

211
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,375
Everyone calls him Pollito

212
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
If you had to borrow money to buy

213
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,775
Corned Baton Rouge right now in the US

214
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
And not in Mex

215
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Icicle

216
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Apple 25

217
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
Interest rate interest rate

218
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,015
So that's something it's it's a big difference

219
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Big Bird

220
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:33,439
Those dramatically lower interest rates are part of why more than a million cows cross the border

221
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,023
EGR advantages like that get talked about all the time by economist

222
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Comparative advantage

223
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
She's one of the first things you learn about in economics class

224
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,703
America could raise caps on bass chunks of land

225
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Or

226
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
It could do other more profitable things with that land

227
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
Mexico has land

228
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,407
And of all the things they can choose to do with it raising calves

229
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
This is a relatively good option

230
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
That's

231
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,295
Comparative advantage and that's why they shut all these

232
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Giant animals

233
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Across-the-board

234
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
Some of the cattle coming across the Mexico are sold Direct

235
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
American Rancher

236
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Brokers

237
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,023
Others go up for sale auction right next to

238
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
The Stockyards owner

239
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Westside

240
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
309 on these men 309

241
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,543
In all three flags the Mexican flag American flag the New Mexico flag

242
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
On the wall and Auctioneer Jack Blandford

243
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
Find a drive up the price on a batch of house

244
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Peter Farrelly

245
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,759
Small compared to the others in Blandford is joking that they're so compact

246
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063
You can drive them home in the cab of your pickup truck

247
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
He starts the bidding at $2 a pound

248
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
8 inches up to $2.07

249
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
And then Blandford

250
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
Declares

251
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
They're sold 43 on 30

252
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
Another nice set

253
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
As they scramble out of the auction Hall the animals

254
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
Loaded into trucks

255
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Is all over the

256
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,007
Alvaro bustillos the owner of Vaquero trading says

257
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
A lot of the couch from Mexico go to the

258
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,127
Panhandle Colorado California

259
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,223
Lot of small cattle is going right now to Oklahoma

260
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
Whenever you get a million of anything moving around

261
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
High Finance

262
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
Shows up with their Wares

263
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,183
And Alvaro is Wall Street agent right down here on the border

264
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
He doesn't like to call himself a cattle broker

265
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
The way he describes it

266
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
The lot more than just buy and sell cows

267
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
We facilitate the trade

268
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Between

269
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
Mexican producer and I

270
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
And I just realized

271
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Us buyer

272
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,871
Which could be any anywhere from

273
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,199
Cattle feeder all the way to a Rancher farmer

274
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,759
Even we sell like I sell cattle to

275
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Private equity

276
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
Vons

277
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Which

278
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
Mandi sometimes

279
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,207
By the cattle for their portfolios folios private equity

280
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Basically just

281
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
Big pools of investor money

282
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
Cows aren't just

283
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,351
House to Wall Street there

284
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
Stable commodity something worth

285
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,935
Buying and selling

286
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
2 Wall Street a cow is a

287
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,007
A series of coffee

288
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Send opportunity

289
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
To sell

290
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,079
The cost to buy it

291
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
The cost to feed it

292
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
Price it sells for

293
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
Wall Street makes all kinds of options

294
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,015
Contracts and Deals available to the cattle rancher

295
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
They'll buy the cattle for me the live cattle

296
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
And that they'll sell the contract

297
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
For that a specific month

298
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
Where it's going to get slaughtered okay

299
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,071
And then they have to pencil in the input

300
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Up to feed that

301
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,679
That steer which would be the future of the Corn

302
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,239
That's the break even

303
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
And you can even call it a crush

304
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Are you by the

305
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
Live cattle

306
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
Seldom

307
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Seldom

308
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
Fat future and buy the corn

309
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,527
A crush of course you got to love trade jargon

310
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
The crush is the way you described a 3-way bet

311
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
They take bets on the cost

312
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,975
Difficult Without Really dealing with a real cow

313
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
Bets on the cost

314
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
Feed the cow the cost of the

315
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,399
The meat and if the price of the mean ends up higher than the cost

316
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Feed the cow

317
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
You get rich

318
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
They probably aren't

319
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
Without touching any cows

320
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,383
Put the to like in this Futures market right people are buying selling

321
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Cattle that

322
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,199
They've never even seen yet right in

323
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
Understanding of what you do you make sure that

324
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
In that

325
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,367
That real cow shows up eventually right or that

326
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
That's what we do like

327
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
What we do is

328
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
We buys

329
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
Cattle from Aldi's

330
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
Producers

331
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
Put them all together

332
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
And then standardized

333
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,167
Risorgimento

334
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
Sizes and qualities

335
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,519
There's always a market for everything

336
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:37,919
Last year Alvarado helped farmers and big beef companies in New York Traders by more than a hundred and fifty thousand

337
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Head of cattle from

338
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,783
Because at the end of all that wheeling-and-dealing like

339
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
A real cow actually has two

340
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,367
Show up at American Farms and feedlots

341
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
That cow grows in weight and value

342
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
In less than a year a 400 pound calf

343
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
1400 lb

344
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
$1,600

345
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Worth of cow

346
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
Out of the cost of the cow and the Feed and Seed

347
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
Subtracted from the sale price

348
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Crushed

349
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Maybe

350
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
Then they get turned into beef

351
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Slaughtered that's

352
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
What happens

353
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,383
To recap

354
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
We have eight

355
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
$30 fraud

356
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,223
Sperm going from the US

357
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Down to Mexico

358
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,807
When the calf cross the border into the US

359
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
It sold for 8

360
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
$800

361
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,879
The US farmer got

362
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
1600 bucks

363
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
He sold the cow to the slaughterhouse

364
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:27,583
And then the final retail value of that box me when it leaves the slaughterhouse

365
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
It is

366
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
35

367
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
$100

368
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
But remember

369
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,983
The same amount of beef going

370
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
Interview s

371
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
Is also going

372
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
Out and this is worth

373
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
It really surprised me

374
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
A lot of that meat will go

375

387
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
Someone who has to get a lot of different things

A lot of different places

389

It used to be that a butcher would get a carcass and cut the meat up right there

395
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927

You take round in the US you know

410
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,511

In Mexico

00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,031
That that round is referred to as milanezza which is a

Eat but I know the United States I can go into a grocery store and get them

454
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919
But they don't say where the cows

455
00:17:54,175 --> 00:18:00,063
Came from because the United States acknowledges that even cows that are born in Mexico

456
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Our kind of

457
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367

464
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,103

00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575

But as long as Mexican ranchers best option is to raise calves and US Traders best

478
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
Adoption is to grow and slaughter them

479
