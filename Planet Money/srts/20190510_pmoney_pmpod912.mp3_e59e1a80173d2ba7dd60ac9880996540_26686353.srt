1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,376
Maybe you've heard that this guy named James holtzhauer is absolutely dominating

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,936
You've become a celebrity now because

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,960
Of your accomplice

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
Restaurants on

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,008
Jeopardy

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,312
Going to be a lot of pressure on

7
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,360
Thank you I appreciate that

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,664
Is James's sort of a relic

9
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,456
13 years ago

10
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
His only sibling

11
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,784
Ian married my only sibling

12
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,344
And since then I have been

13
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,880
Keenly aware

14
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
The James

15
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,488
Is kind of a better version of me

16
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,560
We're the same age but James skipped a grade

17
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,888
We were both math Majors I still have nightmares about it but

18
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:42,240
James apparently didn't even need to go to class and made money playing online poker in them

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
Meantime

20
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,800
I went into public radio

21
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
James got really good at analyzing Sports data became a very successful Sports gambler

22
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,504
Retired at like 27

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,784
Travel the world

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Climb Mount Fuji

25
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
In a type

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
And look

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,184
I can handle being left

28
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744
But now

29
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
Their nieces and nephews in

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Here you are

31
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:12,448
Usher wait is this recording for sure this is Jack and Scarlett

32
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,496
James and I are there only uncle

33
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,800
And it is irrationally important

34
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,104
That they think I'm the cooler on

35
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
And this recording was the moment

36
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
I was sure I had one

37
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,760
Jack and Scarlett were visiting me in New York

38
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,064
I let them play video games Zelda breath of

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,832
The wild

40
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,928
I had just taking them to the Harry Potter play on Broadway

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,256
And now I had gotten them into a real NPR Studio

42
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,816
You interviewed me first

43
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Okay

44
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
Hello

45
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
So

46
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912
Jack

00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
Do you have any hobbies

48
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,752
I like playing Minecraft and watching Uncle bunny

49
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
Uncle Kenny play Zelda

50
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,848
Watching Uncle Kenny

51
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Play Zelda

52
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,712
Of course 2 months later is when James shows up on Jeopardy

Health power for 34 years I felt like this isn't going to

55
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,488

56
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024

Listen to up first weekdays

95
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
From NPR news

96
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:56,544
James holzhauer is Las Vegas PSA professional

97
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
Sports

98
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,104
April 4th

99
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
James episode number

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,016
What does that mean exactly this year I like the lightning

101
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,064
I don't really know I'm not look

102
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
James has unretired from Gam

103
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
Point out here

104
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
The Tampa Bay Lightning wound up getting

105
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Crushed

106
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,768
One of the few things James would get wrong on Jeffrey

107
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:21,119
Play are the highest capital city

108
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,935
Watching this first episode we are all very nerve

109
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,495
The returning Champion is really quite good

110
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
It's clear right away

111
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
Alex is playing the traditional style

112
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
River Jeopardy's played on this giant

113
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,527
And Alex starts in the top row with the easiest least valuable

114
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,111
And finally you're an 11 don't tread on me meme

115
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Alex

116
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,695
Car with highest capital city for 200

117
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
Kendra catmandu Kingston

118
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
Alex a new capital city for so you know Alex stays in the same category and then moves to the

119
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,983
The next clue slightly harder slightly more.

120
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,079
But as soon as James gets control of the board he does something totally different

121
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
James what is Addis Ababa

122
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Yes

123
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,967
Ballpark Cuisine 1000 he goes right to the hardest

124
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
Most valuable clue

125
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
Game for the Diamondbacks

126
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:17,183
Yes you three 1000cc jumped to a whole new category again directly to the hardest

127
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Clue and

128
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,303
I'm checking Twitter as this is on TV and parts of Jeopardy Twitter

129
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
He changed his style

130
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
Jarring it is hard

131
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
To play along at home to it

132
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
I will later learn

133
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
But this style

134
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
Isky

135
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,847
How James has been able to rack up unprecedented

136
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
So now the last clue

137
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
So this first episode is rapping

138
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,759
I Dreamed a Dream from this show

139
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
Alex

140
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,951
You're right and that takes you to 18,000 ordinarily that would be remarkable but James has 40

141
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,071
1412 The Runaway game it's a runaway game Alex

142
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
James has such a huge lead

143
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
But nobody can catch him in finals

144
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:06,079
Players here's your clue the Jordan bear and Weber Rivers deposit over a million tons of

145
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
Minerals into it

146
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
Annually

147
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,711
Much of that chloride and sodium

148
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
30 seconds good luck

149
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,855
I was aware that at some point James decided to get very good at

150
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,903
He banished other show called

151
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
The Chase & Dunn absurd

152
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
Believe well but

153
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
Cleveland Jeopardy

154
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
It is not just about trivia James is using

155
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Some sort of

156
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
Strategy or tactic

157
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
The question I had was like

158
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,495
What is it actually mean to be good at Jeopardy

159
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
What specifically are you

160
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
You good at

161
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,359
That was a question I wanted to finance

162
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
After of course this episode

163
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
Games

164
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:45,247
I turn this game into a runaway

165
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
Did he get the correct response though

166
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,855
Apopse the Great Salt Lake on his

167
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
I most certainly did but Uncle Jamie

168
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,951
Has written a little extra

169
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
Happy birthday Jack alright

170
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
Is a version of Myra

171
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:04,447
And your wager will add 3268

172
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
3268

173
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
March 26th

174
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
2008

175
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
Jack's birthday

176
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
James and I share four

177
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
And happy birthday

178
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,991
Hate is an happy birthday we're down to

179
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
You get to each of them

180
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,855
At least ones happy birthday Scarlett again

181
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,207
You ready to go you want to roll I am

182
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
Recording now

183
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
I'm Ken Jennings

184
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,399
Ken Jennings is the greatest Jeopardy champion of all time

185
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
But to understand what made him great

186
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
You have to understand that he got on the show Eddie

187
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
Key moment in it

188
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,383
For the first 20 years of Jeopardy contestants will get bounced after winning five times

189
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,687
A car

190
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
And Sia

191
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
And there's a car

192
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,575
Drive Away literally get in the car and

193
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
We don't want to see you again

194
00:07:54,367 --> 00:08:00,511
And they change their format to which is indefinite

195
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,071
After I tried out in 2003

196
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
Before I went on the show

197
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:09,215
Ken says anecdotally he heard the show was like because someone one I don't know

198
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
10 game

199
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
Kenwood win a lot more

200
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
And let's be clear

201
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,383
It's partly because he is better than an average

202
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
Contestant

203
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
At trivia

204
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
According to Ken himself that advantage

205
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Marginal

206
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,111
Because by the time people get on Jeopardy they're very good most contestants know most of the

207
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
The answers

208
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
It's according to Ken

209
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
The biggest ant

210
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Is the ability

211
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
To buzz in

212
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
Before everyone else

213
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,375
The deal with the Buzzard feathers not live until Alex finishes reading the question

214
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
For your brother

215
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
Girls like you actually lock yourself out

216
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,311
For a fraction of a second so the big mistake on the show is people who are all adrenalized

217
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
And are buzzing too quick

218
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
Some degree Jeopardy is kind of

219
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,711
A video game

220
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,551
Had a crappy video game where it's like light goes on press button

221
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,647
That's it is that true I do like to think of it as a beautiful art

222
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
And not a really crappy video game

223
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,303
When does the art comes in with internalizing the rhythm of Alex

224
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
Kangaroo up in South

225
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,423
Korea and he says the only english-language station there

226
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
Play Jeopardy right after

227
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
What's a young age

228
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
Like a second language almost

229
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Scan Inc

230
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
Turtle eyes Dalek

231
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
Alex Trebek voice

232
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,127
How he reads

233
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,455
Clues what it sounds like when he's about to finish reading

234
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,807
So when can get on Jeopardy he is very good at the buzzer

235
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
He is getting in first

236
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
On 60% of the clues

237
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,975
And then the more he wins the more practice he gets on the buzzer

238
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,791
And the new contestants they are just like Lambs to the slaughter

239
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
After 48 win

240
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
The show steps in

241
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
And institutes more in-depth buzzer

242
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359
And I really did make a difference as soon as they did that you could see the attitude Gap really lower and the market became a lot more competitive

243
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Do they tell you that they're going to do this

244
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Are you pissed

245
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
I don't think anyone ever said hey Ken were going to let the challengers practice more he did not anger me I was flattered

246
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
You know it's like

247
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,511
It's like the NBA adding different like Lane violations to stop Wilt Chamberlain from

248
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
Doing those tippens

249
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
Can wound up winning

250
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,351
2 point

251
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
$5000000

252
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,471
Over 74 straight Jeopardy

253
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,263
No one has come

254
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
You can close the next closest

255
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Is James

256
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
Who's currently at 22 game

257
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,175
So arguably

258
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
The increase buzzer training has

259
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
Evened out the car

260
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
But Savvy players

261
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Practice the buzzer be

262
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
Before they get on the show

263
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
They know

264
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
The Jeopardy

265
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
Is a trivia game second

266
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
And it kind of crappy video game

267
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
James episode number four

268
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
We need to talk about daily.

269
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,239
Professional Gambler who's used to betting large amounts

270
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
If he hits those Daily Doubles

271
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,407
Watch out Daily Doubles are the hidden clues that let a player wager as much of their money as

272
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
Three of these per game

273
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
And in this game

274
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
James found every

275
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
Single

276
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:09,695
Yes architecture 804 there for Daily Double this was not a

277
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,023
I've been watching James at this point for 4 episode

278
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,119
And he consistently found most of the Daily Doubles like

279
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,679
At a rate that seem statistically impossible

280
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
And then when he found them

281
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,031
He would wager enormous amount of his money

282
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
So this Daily Double for exam

283
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
This is late in the game

284
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,639
James has a huge

285
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,223
And lots of contested in this situation would wager like nothing

286
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
Preserve the lead

287
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
And keep that money it will turn into real money if you win

288
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
But in this case

289
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
James Betts so much

290
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,999
You can hear one of the audience members whistle in disbelief 25000

291
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
All right

292
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Here's the clue

293
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
In Andalusia

294
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
Arabic

295
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
Calligraphy

296
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
Represents

297
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
This style

298
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,311
Name for medieval visitors from Africa

299
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,639
What is Moorish Moriches right

300
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,711
James did not miss a single Daily Double clue

301
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Throughout this day

302
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
He had that huge

303
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
And as a result at the end of the first two rounds

304
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
Kewanee huge amount of my

305
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:16,511
James what is Austin you are right that's okay to 17600

306
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
72600

307
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Trebek says

308
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
The one-day record

309
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:28,287
Is 77 fast

310
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,079
Hahaha

311
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
Final Jeopardy coming up

312
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Ironically

313
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,015
It's a metaphor meaning a huge step forward

314
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
But this to word process

315
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,903
Only occurs on a subatomic scale

316
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,439
30 seconds good luck

317
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
James is going to break this

318
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,583
But what will make headlines the next day

319
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
Is how brutally

320
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Thoughtfully

321
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
James breaks the one-day record

322
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
70 mm

323
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
600 going into final for you James

324
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,127
We need to find Quantum Leap

325
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,455
We do happy birthday

326
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,039
Badger booger booger his nickname for his daughter

327
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:19,231
How much did you risk 38000 314 a new one day record 100

328
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,863
10914 and only had James destroyed the existing Jeopardy record

329
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,423
He wagered so that the new record

330
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Would be his daughter's birthday

331
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
1109 40

332
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
November 9th

333
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
2014

334
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
He's back tomorrow Jonas

335
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
How are you feeling about the about the record falling

336
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
I'm

337
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,527
You know I'm totally cool with the record falling I think it's

338
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,879
Great Rodger Craig won $77,000 in a single Jeopardy game

339
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
The record

340
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
The James obliterate

341
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,279
A lot of people texted me or called me or whatever and said

342
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
Condolences and they were really sad and I was like

343
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:03,007
I get to just say I've the highest scored other than James holzhauer so that's going to be my claim to fame there

344
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:08,895
Rodger will also always be famous as one of the first players to approach Jeopardy as a data probe

345
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
An approach that

346
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
Was impossible until

347
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
There was Data let's start with a

348
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
The Jeopardy archive

349
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:20,159
Sure the Jeopardy archive is it's an online website

350
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:26,047
Dad all these super fans God bless them created they have tapes of the show

351
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:31,935
And put all the questions and answers into a web page for each episode of Jeopardy

352
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
I'm going to pull it up here

353
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Okay

354
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
Like episode oh my

355
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,127
It's laid out like a board and then if you mouse-over

356
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
The dollar amount of the clue it will reveal the answer

357
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
This is incredible

358
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
So I knew about it in

359
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
To either 2005 or

360
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
2006

361
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
You know it's very soon after

362
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
Decided to scrape it

363
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
Download the website

364
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
Download every single

365
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,071
Clue yes there were two hundred thousand

366
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,375
250000 I think now it's up to

367
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,471
The 300,000 250000 that's right

368
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
Rodger has a PhD in

369
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Computer science

370
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
And he was curious like

371
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Now that I've downloaded

372
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
All of Jeopardy

373
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
What categories

374
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Is the show

375
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
Julie ask

376
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,551
So the most frequently at a high level is history geography literature

377
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,367
Not not surprising probably I guess those those

378
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
3A that's the bread and butter

379
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,487
The show says you can vent dig down into those categories

380
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,047
Within history you need to know America

381
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,119
Then within that you need to know the president

382
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
Backwards and forwards

383
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
Equally important

384
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,751
This analysis showed Rodger that kind of stuff

385
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
That wouldn't be worth his time to stop

386
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,103
That's right so it's much more important to know

387
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Abraham Lincoln

388
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:48,479
In Phantom of the Opera then it is to know all the cheeses that

389
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
They might ask

390
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,087
The Jeopardy archive is a huge Innovation it is allowed a whole new generation

391
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Players

392
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
To hunt

393
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
Ferdie's exploitable parts of the game

394
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,791
So here's all my scraping code luckily I just ran it once it took like

395
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
Half an hour I was like I'm going to go

396
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:09,215
Wake make some dinner come back I think this will be done in just a half an hour

397
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Send me the recipe

398
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,103
This is Monica to she won Jeopardy's 2012 college tournament

399
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,663
As a high schooler taking college classes

400
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Per half-hour dish by the way

401
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,479
Cacio e Pepe

402
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
So what I'm going to do here

403
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Should work

404
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Twan

405
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
Well laptop

406
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
You can have it

407
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
Monica is showing

408
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
How she scraped

409
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,207
10 seasons of Jeopardy archive

410
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
How to look at Daily

411
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
Are they placed random

412
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
Is there a pattern

413
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,399
So should we go to do is look this top row to see

414
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,215
Deletable never comes up in the top row

415
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,007
Turned out Daily Doubles

416
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:48,383
Not randomly distributed at all actually you can see this same pattern top upset

417
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:52,735
Bro3 Andro400 most likely to have Daily Double

418
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,295
Daily Doubles are way more likely

419
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
To show up

420
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
In the row

421
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
With the second hardest Clues

422
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
And the rug with a third heart

423
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
And if you know this

424
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
You can go Daily Double hunting

425
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
Bouncing from category

426
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,839
The category in the second and third to last

427
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
Monica has used this strategy

428
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
Rodger Craig use this during his wreck

429
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Game

430
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
Is also the key

431
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Two James Holt hours

432
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
This

433
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
Is how he seems to find

434
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
A magical number

435
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663

454
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
Oh my God

455
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,047
It is hard to overstate just how dominant James

456
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
He is still on the show

457
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,631
It's just on break right now for the teachers

458
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Cement butt

459
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
As of this writing

460
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,983
James has won 22 straight

461
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,287
+ 1.7 million

462
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
$10 he is averaging

463
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,895
Nearly $77,000 and episode

464
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,455

We have this tradition where we pause the game right before finals

469
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,535
Maybe try and figure out

470
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
Whose birthday James will wager

471
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
Based on his lead and what he

472
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
He can safely bet

473
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
30

NPR news podcast

493
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,247
White Lies investigates murder in Selma Alabama

494
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Nineteen

495
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,807
55in exposes the

496
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Conspiracy the

497
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
Kept it on song

498
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
Until now

499
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,927
White Lies start listening to

500
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,815
You do remember I don't even remember what the how good your memory on White 2

501
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,911
The answer actually wasn't the first the first episode the answer was Great Salt Lake

502
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
Yeah and then you wrote

503
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
Arrow happy birthday Jack

504
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,823
I believe Alex Trebek was like and happy birthday Jack alright

505
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,407
And I was just like a like this is a whole new level of thing that I

506
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
I can't talk

507
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:40,831
I will tell you I went to go visit the kids the week before I was on Jeopardy and they still accidentally referred to me as Uncle Kenny a good 20

508
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,135
I think you're doing just okay

509
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
It's sweet of him to say of course all of that is

510
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
Before he was on

511
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,559
James has been trying to get on Jeopardy since 2011

512
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,119
He's taking the online test like 13 times

513
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:57,471
The culprit in person auditions once for Sports Jeopardy twice for real Jeopardy

514
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
And then finally

515
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
Last January he got the car

516
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,847
Congrats you have three weeks to prepare

517
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,407
2 Chainz with queue Up episodes of Jeopardy

518
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
Play along at home with a makeshift

519
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
Mechanical pencil buzzer

520
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
Wearing shorts but also

521
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
The dress shoes

522
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
He was going to wear on the show I think that was

523
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:20,512
Possibly more important preparation that actually learning any facts or figures the buzzer timing

524
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,072
I think making sure you're comfortable

525
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:28,448
In your elements and also I discovered I really needed dr. Scholl's insoles for my dress shoes so

526
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,008
Assuming at this point in your career you're not wearing dress shoes

527
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
The tremendous amount

528
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:37,664
No on game shows and maybe weddings

529
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,064
You didn't see them on TV that's the stupid jeans and tennis shoes

530
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
Comfortable but

531
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
They said no

532
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,416
When you talk to other Jeopardy champ

533
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Beans about Jane

534
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
They will say that

535
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
He is the quintessential modern

536
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,328
He's great at the buzzer and getting better

537
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
Jane says Guitar Hero

538
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Help with that

539
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,680
He's got an absurdly broad knowledge

540
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Jane Says

541
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
He studies the kid books for

542
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
Only what he needs to know

543
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
Plus pictures

544
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
But the way James has broken Jeopardy

545
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
Is how he is using daily.

546
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Because

547
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
To a gambler

548
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,992
A daily double

549
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:17,344
Is an absurdly good deal that would be irrational to bet smaller

550
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
This requires a bit of explanation

551
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
Patience

552
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,208
Remember the Daily Double allows James

553
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
To wager the money he's

554
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,536
For every dollar he bets

555
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
If you get the clue correct

556
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
She wins a dollar

557
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,888
Bet 10000

558
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,168
Win 10000

559
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,960
And that has like a name in

560
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Gambling Harlan's right

561
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:40,128
Yeah we call it even money proposition when you get paid the same amounts for winning as you will lose for losing

562
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,688
Bet a dollar make a dollar at a casino

563
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
Is usually the payout for

564
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
Playing roulette and betting on

565
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
1 black

566
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,344
Just about half the time black is going to come up

567
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
About half

568
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
The time it won't

569
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,976
Even money payouts are four things that are like a coin toss

570
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,024
That's where you're going to be wrong about half

571
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
Sing about a daily double

572
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
It's paying out

573
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
Even money as if

574
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,424
The players going to get it wrong half

575
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
What's the time

576
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:07,008
That's definitely not true for most players and it is

577
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,032
Certainly not

578
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
For James

579
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Add

580
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,688
You know what my career if I find any money proposition that wins 52% of the time I'm very happy

581
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,272
Where is jeopardy the average contestant gets

582
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,320
70% of their Daily Doubles right

583
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
You know I

584
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:28,512
Think that I have to be over 80% so if I found out personal life out of my work out as much at the Sportsbook with let me

585
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:32,864
You go borrow my me it's kind of thing you if you could borrow money to do it if you like this is probably

586
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
Exactly

587
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,728
Getting a daily double with no money

588
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
Is relatively useless

589
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,288
And this

590
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
Is why James does that

591
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,896
Kind of crazy thing at the beginning of every show

592
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,224
He intentionally avoids the rose wear Daily Doubles

593
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Tend to be

594
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
But he does not start

595
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
With the easiest

596
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
Least valuable

597
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,696
What I do that's different than anyone came before me is I will try to build the pot first you know the

598
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,280
Daily Doubles actually don't come up that much in the thousand-dollar clues but those

599
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,840
Star where the big money is obviously in

600
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,400
Maybe the opponents are not ready

601
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,168
For this

602
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,496
Dance of the big money questions right away they don't feel comfortable with it

603
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
You know what's in my comfort zone

604
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
South Pasadena dad is there

605
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
Indian ideal game then James

606
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
This would work his way across the bottom thousand-dollar row

607
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
Rack up money while he's at

608
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
Opponents are still

609
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
Kind of in a daze

610
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,088
Then you find a daily double

611
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
And bet everything

612
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,904
Within 5 minutes

613
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
Play

614
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
He has opened up an insurmountable

615
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
And you can see James manage his risk

616
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
Based on how much game is

617
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
So early on he'll take

618
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
Huge shots because

619
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:42,240
The upside is that he can basically put the game away

620
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,776
The downside

621
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,312
Is yeti losing a lot

622
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
There is a ton of game left

623
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
He's very good

624
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
Probably catch up

625
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
Towards the end of the game though

626
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,736
James is more risk-averse

627
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,040
There's less time to recover from a bad

628
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
By the way

629
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,880
This is how you're supposed to manage your retirement

630
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
Riskier stocks when you're younger

631
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
Safer bonds when you're heading into

632
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024
James

633
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Sports gambler

634
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Has a different amount

635
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
I get mad at

636
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:13,984
Football coaches who are afraid to call for a big play Early in the game you know because they they want to

637
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,336
Still be in the game at the end then it turns out they have no chance for the

638
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:22,432
Hail Mary or something similar to that at the end yeah they would have done better day

639
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
Do some more gambling earlier

640
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,320
For me it's about gambling earlier so I don't have to sweat Final Jeopardy so much

641
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,648
Yeah well look man I am I am

642
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:38,048
99.9% of the time just very happy for you look at it this way if I lose to Ken Jennings and their Deathmatch

643
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:44,448
That's maybe we'll both be second and third place to Uncle Ken after that

644
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
Family I just did

645
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,568
I think we'll just put together a concerted effort to stop that

646
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,896
We would love to hear how you or anybody else

647
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
Crack the difference

Can I ask a quick favor that I near me.

670
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,776
I can give you the long back story but my guy Roz

00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,312
Ghost of a podcast called how I

672
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,104

So during this James

675
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
I was

676
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
Whining to my sister about being gay

677
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
Uncle

00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,528
And she goes

Why do the kids care about guy Roz
