Today Show contains profanity and offensive racial

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,552
Something strange

9
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,320
Has happened

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
To the passage

11
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,904
And I don't know if you've noticed this but

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,952
It just happens to me every week

13
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
Feels like Friday

14
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,512

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048

Here's how this bizarre time-warp is affecting all of us here

17
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
At Planet Money

18
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,496

We tell you what happened

23
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968
The people after we turn the mic

24
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
Microphones off

25
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,528
We call it the rest of the story

26
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,600
Named after the immortal words of broadcaster

27
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
Paul Harvey

28
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392

31

The rest of the story

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,632
But things in this world are now changing so quickly

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
This year

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,752

37
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,152
We're doing it hello and welcome to Planet Money on Robert Smith today on the show

We're going to check back in on the robot

40
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,112
It was supposed to make us rich by now

41
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,952
And a surprising new tactic in a war that we covered extensively

42
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
Eagles vs chickens

Rest of the story

52
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352
With me in studio is Elsa Chang hey Robert good to have you here altitude and amazing podcast back

53
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
Back in May

54
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
About

55
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
A rock band a rock band with

56
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
Inoffensive name

57
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
The name was

58
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
The Slap

59
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
Well offensively

60
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
OK play plans arnesia nahmir

61
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,760
And they were in a battle with the federal government over registering their name

62
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
As a trademark

63
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,320
Because

64
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
The federal government

65
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
Did not want to put that sort of official seal

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,232
Official like r with a circle on a registered trade mark seal

67
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,256
On a name which

68
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
They felt

69
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Was

70
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
Disparaging to Asian

71
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
That's right

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
Now Simon tan the founder of the rock group he thought

73
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:53,312
That's not fair that's the violation of My First Amendment right so he took his case all the way to this

74
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,408
And that is where we ended the podcast but

75
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
In the last few months a lot has happened

76
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
Ketchup

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
So the court agreed with Simon Tam and Aslan

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,392
They said yes this is a violation of the First Amendment the US government cannot be in the business

79
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,464
Deciding what trademarks are disparaging

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,864
Which ones are not and banning only the ones that are disparaging

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
Useless t-shirts

82
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,216
All money goes to the map exactly

83
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
But people have been obsessed with sort of a larger question

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
And because of this

85
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
And that is

86
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
Have the floodgates open

87
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,968
Does this mean that a bunch of racially offensive

88
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,760
Misogynist homophobic

89
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,832
Hateful phrases are now going to be registered as trademarks

90
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
You're about to hear some of these words just another warning

91
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
I called them

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
Trademark lawyer Ed Timberlake

93
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
And he's been tracking

94
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,656
All the trademark applications coming through the door since the Supreme Court decision and cure some of the names people want to trademark

95
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
Gutter s****

96
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Chink

97
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
Damn vegans

98
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
Niger

99
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
Niger

100
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Niger

101
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Niger

102
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
And Nicodemus

103
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
Wow wait how many niggas

104
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
Did you just

105
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Massage therapy

106
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Ver

107
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,880
At least five here and there probably more since then

108
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,512
We saw at least five trademark applications for n**** have been filed since the

109
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
The Supreme Court decision

110
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
Yes I a couple on the day of the

111
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
It was actually three

112
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
And I was curious you know who were these people behind these applications to register and i g g a

113
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,175
On the same day that the Supreme Court decision came down because whoever they were

114
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,783
They must be pretty determined people people who want to own the word

115
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
For commercial purposes

116
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:45,951
And of course the fear is that this would be someone who has racist intentions

117
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Potential

118
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
So I tracked down

119
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
This one guy in Mississippi

120
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,119
Who was behind two of the applications

121
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,959
To register niggaa on the same day as the Supreme Court decision

122
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
And his name is

123
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
Curtis bordenave

124
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,359
Why do you want to register this word so badly

125
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
I thought that I had a duty

126
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,223
You know I'm saying in a responsibility to

127
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
To protect that word to secure that word

128
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
You know I'm saying in to make sure that is used in a way

129
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
That I think would not disparage

130
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
In case you're wondering Curtis is African-American and

131
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
He's now in this

132
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Race

133
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
Against the racist because if he can trademark the word

134
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
Then he can keep other people from

135
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Making products

136
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,727
Bad people

137
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
For making pie

138
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,263
Okay

139
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Curtis wants to do is basically

140
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,591
Brand t-shirts

141
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Words with n i g g a

142
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,687
Emblazoned on the front of the T-shirt will be

143
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,735
Themes like Unity or Brotherhood

144
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,063
So people will associate those good positive ideas

145
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
With the brand Niger

146
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,415
I mean he know he says this is a way of

147
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Reclaiming

148
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,535
Which is exactly what Simon Tam said about the name of the band

149
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:59,935
Curtis was especially grateful that he pounds so quickly that he moved in right on the same day as a supreme court opinion

150
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Because what he noticed

151
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Was

152
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Another guy

153
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Wanted to register

154
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
And IGA as a trademark

155
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,967
Jake Curtis a really funny feeling about the whole thing of bad feeling

156
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,271
Was that same guy

157
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,111
Also wanted to register the swastika as a trademark

158
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,695
To criticize sitting there thinking this can't be good

159
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,303
One guy wants to register and IGA and the swastika

160
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
So I called him up

161
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
His name is Steve Maynard

162
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Why swastikas

163
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
Because

164
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:38,335
The term has an incendiary meaning behind it and it's in it

165
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,639
Currently used as a symbol of hate

166
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
And if we can own the brand

167
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
We will be able to control

168
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
The sale of the brand in the use of the brand as well

169
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Ocu

170
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,647
You're trying to basically grab the

171
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,231
So real actual racist and haters

172
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Can't grab

173
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
Have the swastika as a realtor trademark

174
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
Correct

175
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Hi-C Maynard

176
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,703
Is actually trying to do the exact same thing that Curtis bordenave

177
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,263
He is trying to do so very good people buying very bad

178
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,359
But there's a catch in order to register this

179
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Rustica as a

180
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
Trademark you have

181
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
Cell

182
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
A swastika product

183
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,063
So Maynard has figured out a solution to this problem he is going to sell

184
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Blanket

185
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
Kids duvet covers socks

186
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Apparel with the

187
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Swastika

188
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,719
Totally overpriced

189
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Hi

190
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,911
I have reservations about this first of all duvet covers with swastika

191
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Should not exist

192
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
In the world

193
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
But also it's just

194
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
Such a loaded

195
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
Emotional offensive

196
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:42,847
Symbol

197
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:48,735
They even if you're doing it for good even if you put it on for the even if no one buys it the very fact of its existence

198
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
Seems wrong

199
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
And you just put your finger

200
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
On a fundamental problem

201
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Steve Maynard

202
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
Under trademark law the government will only approve

203
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
Your trademark application if

204
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
Consumers connect your trademark

205
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
With the product that you are selling

206
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
But the swastika

207
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
It's so well-known there's so much

208
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,543
Terrible history behind it

209
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
The Nazis

210
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
The Holocaust

211
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
There is unlikely

212
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
Anyone would connect that symbol

213
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
To some brand of

214
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Blankets

215
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,807
Miracle probably never get to trademark

216
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Swastika

217
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
But then again

218
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
Neither will anyone else

219
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,999
Elsa Chang thank you so much you're welcome story

220
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
Going to be honest with you all

221
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,127
We are Planet Money we're not supposed to be here this week doing the show

222
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,943
We have plenty money we're supposed to be rich

223
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
I don't know if you remember the episode we did back in

224
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
April but Planet Money

225
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Developed

226
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
AA stock

227
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
Trading

228
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Twitter bot

229
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:06,047
A little program that that reads Twitter and trade stocks based on tweets from the president of the United

230
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
Donald Trump

231
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,887
Alex goldmark lead our development team

232
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
What happened

233
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
What happened

234
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,775
Yes we call it botas pot of the United States being cute

235
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
The president of the United States

236
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,431
It watches Donald Trump's Twitter feed and if the president mentions accompanied by name

237
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,271
Otis will buy or sell stock of that company depending on if

238
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
The Tweet is positive

239
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Poor negative

240
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
And Alex you pass the Hat we all put money into it so that we have $1,000 in an online stock brokerage

241
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Account

242
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
That is all connected up to BoatUS

243
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:42,399
And it's ready to invest and make money and double and double and double again

244
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
What hap

245
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
POTUS

246
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
Has not made

247
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,031
It has not sold

248
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,335
Or bought a single share of stock

249
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
No when we develop is it seemed like such a

250
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
Great idea

251
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
Because Donald Trump

252
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Tweeting about

253
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
These companies

254
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Coffin

255
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,295
An insult or an attaboy

256
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
And

257
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,927
In the market would immediately move up or down and the

258
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,975
Hopefully we would be on on the right side of

259
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,743
That trade

260
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
But

261
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
I mean at least I've noticed Donald Trump is not

262
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
Tweeting about companies

263
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
He is still Tweeting about company

264
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,959
But he's doing it very early in the morning

265
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,263
And Jessica's at 5 a.m. demon

266
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,639
His thumbs go as the sun is rising and you know it is not going on at that time

267
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
Stock trading doctor

268
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
Stock market does not open

269
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Until 9:30

270
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
I ran the numbers and I check

271
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
And only about 15%

272
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
The President Trump's tweets

273
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,903
Happened while the stock market is

274
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,279
Probably good for the stock market but bad for our

275
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Trading bot

276
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
Police + fun

277
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
So

278
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
I want more

279
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,751
And so do all of the people following POTUS on Twitter they've been sending us

280
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
A ton of different ideas for

281
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
Changing up the

282
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
The computer code

283
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
And making trade

284
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
So I called up money Maggiore the head of Investments at

285
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
At tradeworx he is

286
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
1 people who helped us build our bot

287
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
And I went over some of the idea

288
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Haven't you really want to do this

289
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
Well I want bonus to get a chance

290
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
Trade

291
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,255
That is fair I won't bow to the tray 2

292
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,655
But the reason we have notice and we don't have a person doing this is because

293
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,239
What are the advantages is that

294
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Otis

295
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,311
Can be patient

296
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
Time in discipline

297
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,199
This whole experiment was supposed to teach us about algorithmic trading

298
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,807
So letting my dumb human impulsiveness get in the way just completely defeats

299
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
Literally

300
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
This part is keeping people like us

301
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,583
From getting emotional just want to make money

302
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,935
Okay but I still have two ideas for how to do it and I wanted to do it so 1

303
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
We can trade in what is called after hours

304
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
And you hear about this

305
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
All the time right there is the

306
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
U.s. stock markets are basically open from 9:30

307
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,455
4 but you know if there's somebody

308
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
In another place in the world they decide they really need some

309
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
Some cash in the middle of the night

310
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
There are

311
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
Places where you can trade stocks after hour

312
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,975
Money said letting photos trade in the after-hours Market

313
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,791
It could work technically like he could make the bot do that

314
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Toyota

315
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,911
Because there are so few people trading after hours

316
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
That is just

317
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
Cost more to trade

318
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
And it's

319
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
It's a really risky place for a little bottle

320
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,615
So like on a scale of 1 to 10 how good of an idea

321
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
It's really bad

322
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,759
Okay this is my money so

323
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
I agree with him what else you got

324
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
My next idea was

325
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
What if

326
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
Botas

327
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,951
Read Donald Trump's early morning tweet

328
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
And then

329
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,047
Wait until the Market opens and then buys or sells

330
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Reitman

331
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,887
What's not a good idea let's call it a bad idea

332
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
A bad idea but but with

333
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,287
Less potential to be a disaster

334
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,615
Because the whole logic of Buddhist was that when Trump tweet

335
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,407
He moves a stock price

336
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
Right away so we would buy

337
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Right away

338
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
And then get out

339
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,319
30 minutes later so that we minimize our

340
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
But if we wait hours

341
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
After the tweet

342
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Then

343
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
All kinds of other thing

344
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,023
Could move the stock price in between Trump's tweets

345
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
And when the stock

346
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,399
Open so we lose our advantage because something happened in the world to move stocks

347
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
And

348
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
Arbat didn't detect I can only to text Donald Trump

349
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,287
Right there could have been a big thing tonight before

350
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
That's ready

351
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
To burst

352
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Anthropocene when the market

353
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,431
It is obviously a bad idea to change your

354
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Trading strategy

355
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
In the middle of your experiment

356
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
But you know what

357
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,623
We should do it anyway

358
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
POTUS is going to

359
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Starting right now

360
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
If President Trump tweets about a company

361
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
Before the Market opens

362
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
POTUS will see it

363
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
Make a decision to buy or sell the stock

364
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
And then jump into action right when the market

365
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,031
I don't know if we should have told all the other stock Traders are our strategy

366
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Botas will be looking to make a deal

367
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
At 9:30 in the morning

368
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
We're suckers on this when they kill Alex

369
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,015
Thank you Robert if you want to follow

370
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783

Robert Smith

394
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
I'm here for the summer recipes

00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
Jacob Goldstein of all of the many many

396
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,239
Many many fine stories

397
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,799
You called what is the most important thing you have

398
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
Hotels right now

399
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
I got an update on Eagles versus

400
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
I meant

401
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
So okay as you recall

402
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
Early this year I went down

403
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
Georgia where Annette Will Harris he's up

404
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
A farmer who raises

405
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
Utah free-range all natural

406
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,415
He took me out into one of his fields

407
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
And he showed me his one big problem

408
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,279
Bald eagles keep killing his chicken

409
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
So this got so this were looking at here is basically

410
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
The back half of

411
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
Chicken right there

412
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
Feet and legs

413
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,543
But the top half is essentially the eagle

414
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,615
Easiest way into the body cavity

415
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Cuz you seen that

416
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,527
That happening with your seen thousands of time legal to sticking his head in that body cavity

417
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,855
Now the problem as I remember from the pie chest was

418
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
You can't kill the eagle

419
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,791
This is a national symbol

420
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,863
Any show me all these things he tried he tried Nets

421
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,959
Annoys Cannon's any special guns that shoot firecrackers in the air

422
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Not at work

423
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,311
And that's how we ended the podcast

424
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
You would lose it to the

425
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Pandora listeners

426
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
God love them

427
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,735
Felt like this was an opportunity for them to solve

428
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,319
So many people wrote to us and I found out road to Will

429
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,367
Dozens of people with all these

430
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,671
Suggestions you know one person was like

431
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:32,255
I was hiking in Peru and the chickens have had little red cape

432
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
Tied around their neck

433
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
And somebody else was like I work in this Botanica

434
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Garden

435
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:42,239
And we had bagpipe music at a wedding and that made the Eagles go away

436
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
Writable array of of suggestion

437
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,127
Actually called up one of the people who heard the story and wanted to help

438
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,455
Diesel mechanic from Southern California named Brian Hall

439
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,783
And when he heard the story immediately thought of this

440
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,855
It's really astonishing thing that happened to him 20 years

441
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
He was working at a lamp

442
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,975
In the landfill was just infested with

443
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
Seagulls

444
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
And if you know seagulls

445
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
You don't like this is a prop

446
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
If you're working on the equipment

447
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,935
Landfills

448
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
Government

449
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Covered with drop

450
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,871
You never seen anything s*** until you seen a single ship

451
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
Gratuitous

452
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
And and

453
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,343
The people at the landfill like we'll back in Georgia had tried all these different ways to try and get rid of the birds inside

454
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,415
Still tried those same guns that shoot fireworks

455
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
And none of it work

456
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Until

457
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,535
Out of the blue somebody came to us

458
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,143
And when a piece of

459
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Fishing

460
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,751
Warm Springs

461
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,079
Up in the air between the two poles

462
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
They won't be able to laugh

463
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
We what

464
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:58,527
So okay so so actually try it and I'll explain what they did they put up

465
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,575
220 ft poles

466
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
Right up into the sky

467
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,439
One on each side of the area where they were working at the land

468
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
And then they strong a single

469
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:11,071
Big piece of fishing line or monofilament line

470
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
Between the poles up 20 feet in the sky

471
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
The weirdest thing happened

472
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Seagulls

473
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Stop

474
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,567
Flying over the area where they had sprung up the line

475
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
Then

476
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
The seagull

477
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,919
They just stood around in a circle

478
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
Outside where Holly and the other guy

479
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,039
It was really weird

480
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
You know

481
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
Thousand

482
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
Eagles

483
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,255
Standing around the edge looking in on you and you just take

484
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,071
Okay where is Alfred Hitchcock

485
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,399
Amazing and a month later the seagulls

486
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,215
Left do we know why this work no it's so easy

487
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:53,055
Something something of a mystery we actually been called a few scientists

488
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
It's not clear apparently somehow the line confuses the birds like maybe they see the light.

489
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,015
Glinting off it but but in some way they feel like they can

490
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Tomorrowland

491
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
In the area underneath the

492
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Nobody really knows it just work

493
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,695
At least it worked in California with the seagulls

494
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,511
And then when Holly heard our show he thought

495
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Well maybe it'll work in Georgia

496
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
With the Eagles

497
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,447
And he really really wanted to get this message till 2 will to the chicken farm

498
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
He reached out to us

499
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,847
He had one of his sons go online and figure out the phone number for Will's Farm be called

500
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:32,735
The farm you got voicemail White Oak pastures in Bluffton Georgia

501
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,551
Finally Holly Gets on the phone with somebody at the phone

502
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
Tell him about the fish

503
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
And Will Harris runs the farm sinks

504
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,487
What do I got to look at everything

505
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
I may as well try the fishing wire

506
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
So few days ago I called Down to Georgia

507
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
To see how it goes

508
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
Firstly we tried that we feel good about

509
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,983
And it appears that it's working

510
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,543
What is impossible

511
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
I know

512
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
I know

513
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,199
Now to be clear will says he's not ready to declare victory.

514
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
Those are his words

515
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,527
There's a few like big cats one is

516
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,367
So they've strung the wire up over two of their certain groups of chickens

517
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,671
Illegal just went to the other chicken

518
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
On the farm

519
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,999
The other big thing will is worried about is

520
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,535
This is the low season

521
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
They're only a few Eagles

522
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
The state for the summer

523
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,423
The big influx comes in the winter when the eagle migration

524
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,751
So the real test is going to be in a few months when they got all the wires in place

525
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
When all the migratory Eagles

526
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,615
Okay great I will check back

527
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
With you in a few month

528
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:39,295
We never solve problems Atlanta

529
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
I am super shy

530
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
I think it's always will

531
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,999
In fact he asked me to give a message to 2 or listener to Brian Howe

532
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,327
We need to talk. Give me my undying

533
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
Gratitude

534
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
Express my gratitude please

535
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,263
I will do that I will be really happy to do that okay thanks a lot will keep in touch

536
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
Are you drunk Bubba

537
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,895
Holly hadn't heard from the guys on the farm for a while

538
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,711
He didn't know how grateful will was you didn't know

539
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,039
But the experiment so far and you ate is a success

540
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
So I told him

541
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
Oh my God

542
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,680
