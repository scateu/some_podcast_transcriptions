Yeah we had not

107
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
Quite factored in

108
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:21,119
The tens of thousands of other people

109
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,447
Who had come along to do what we have done to be on this yard sale

110
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
Right because the world's longest yard sale is an annual thing

111
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
It's been going on

112
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,127
The first weekend in August for the past 29 years

113
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,223
A guy in Tennessee started it because he wanted to get people to come to his

114
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Small town

115
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,039
And it just kind of grew from there

116
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
And now

117
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,159
Tens of thousands of people come every year from all over the country

118
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
And that first morning

119
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,535
It felt like we were stuck behind all 10000 of them

120
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,375
This looks like a yard sale I would mess with

121
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Hey

Now that's Gray

126
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,783
While we were debating the merits of yard sale stuffed animals

127
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
We spot this one guy

128
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
His mid-thirties super tan baseball cap

129
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
He's carrying this

130
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,719
Huge metal sign

131
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
What is even going on here

132
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303

00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
Fair enough are enough

136
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,079
I've got a 48-foot trailer full of old stuff like

137
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
Excuse me

138
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
This is Josh

139
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,223
Crumpy's from Alabama and he's at the yard sale with his wife

140
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247

Her mom her grandma her great grandma

144
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
Her aunt

145
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,071
Literally my cousin me has his appendix surgery because she was at a yard sale and she was supposed to bring him

146
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
But that is what we're dealing with

147
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
That's the class of Hoarders that we're dealing with

148
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
The total look

149
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
This isn't just an upset

150
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,359
Our family has a wedding venue

151
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,199
And we use this stuff to decorate it right these are people who have it

152
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,759
Turn yard sailing into a profession

153
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
These are people we can learn

154
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,623
So we turn to them and we say luck

155
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
We want to be great yard salers

156
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
Give us all your tip

157
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
And Marcy says

158
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
Before the yard sailing

159
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Starts

160
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
You got to get

161
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,887
I always have extra set of clothes cuz you never know when it's going to rain

162
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,215
I told paper cuz I'm all stopped wherever I got to use the bathroom and

163
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Fat Snax

164
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,055
Animal have plenty of

165
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Change

166
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,127
Did we forget to bring toilet paper

167
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
All right

168
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
That is the pregame

169
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
But at a yard sale

170
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
It's the deal that

171
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,831
And I want to know how Marcy gets the deal

172
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,183
I start with soon as I walk up I just start like down and everything they have

173
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,511
And I start getting in their head I just start playing with your mind

174
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Thinking you know

175
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
Did I pass my sweetheart

176
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,143
Whatever even get this stuff off the ground I mean

177
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
You break him down first

178
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:09,055
They may be on antidepressant by the time they leave this year but there is one exception to this

179
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
And that's if she fine

180
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,639
Plain white dishware

181
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
That is her weakness

182
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,735
In fact her family has forbidden her from

183
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,295
Bringing any more home because she already has

184
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
Tubs of it

185
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,391
Today there is one thing that Marci

186
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
Really has her eye on

187
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
In fact

188
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,255
She's been looking for it for a year-and-a-half

189
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,095
We can find an iron twin bed you're fixing to say it go.

190
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Cuz that's what I'm looking

191
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
I want her to find that iron

192
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Twin bed

193
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
I want to see it go down

194
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,359
Is it cool if we follow you just for a few miles to see how you do your thing

195
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,735
We start following them through mostly Suburban Alabama There's

196
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:53,087
Couple yard sales every two black rental cars

197
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Weather

198
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,183
I finally they pull over a car

199
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,535
She's going to look at the stuff while he parked and the first thing that Marcy buys

200
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,399
The one thing she is not allowed to buy how much are your platters

201
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
A dollar

202
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,543
What you explicitly banned from bringing home white plates

203
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Yeah I was fat

204
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
You know how people like Fitness in just a little bit

205
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
This will get me through the day

206
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
She gets her fix

207
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,783
And then we hit the road again I can't believe they didn't stop

208
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,183
I'm shocked at this point we've been following them long enough we thought we could kind of predict when they would pull over

209
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,743
But then they pull into this one yard sale.

210
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Does not look promising

211
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,423
What's I don't see anything here but they would want

212
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,751
Let's go find out

213
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,847
What do we got here

214
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
No

215
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,735
I'm pretty sure it's at a twin iron bed

216
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
Is a thing

217
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
Did Marcia been looking for

218
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
4 a year

219
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
And a half

220
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,439
Promise a Throwdown if she found

221
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,535
That okay so I can't act 2 interactive so I'm just going to come

222
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
Yeah yeah

223
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
We look around

224
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
And after we had

225
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
Faked it long enough

226
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Finally

227
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
She goes in

228
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
How much are you want for your bed

229
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Okay

230
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,943
What do you want to pay

231
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
We're fixing to Bangladesh connection

232
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Here it is

233
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
He's going in for the kill

234
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,623
Would you do $50

235
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
I'm back

236
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
I can do that

237
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
50 on it

238
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,351
North rotary what she did have a good price

239
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
When someone spare do you want to be forever back

240
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:49,567
There was a time in Marcie's life when she probably would have negotiated down to $25

241
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
And felt like a sucker if she didn't get it

242
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
Not this time

243
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,991
Texting you I was expecting you to be much meaner than you were

244
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
I'm going to head like a hole

245
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
I renewal process myself

246
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
So

247
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
Yeah I'm trying to be a little bit nicer

248
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,231
People trying to make a living

249
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,279
What Marcy is reminding us

250
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,071
Is that yard sales are not

251
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
Anonymous economic transaction

252
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
If you're bargaining online

253
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
All you want is the lowest

254
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,775
Price what is your bargaining face-to-face

255
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,335
Like Marcy on someone's front lawn

256
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
The optimal price

257
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Isn't necessarily the Louis

258
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
It's the lowest one you can get

259
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
Well also being able to say thanks

260
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Maybe I'll see you next year

261
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,695
54 hours to go and 690 MI

262
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,767
We still have 684 left

263
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:47,167
We got to find a way around all of this traffic I told me how you take this dirt road over here

264
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,495
Every horror film should we make a rule for a cell

265
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,311
We can take shortcuts we can even take freeways

266
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:59,967
But we have to hit yard sales in every single state okay but even so we still have so much ground

267
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
Way too much about someone by being in the car with them

268
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Them for way too long

269
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,511
Like I generally try to keep my diet coke have it hidden from people

270
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
But

271
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:19,679
You know three days in the car so secret they're okay but that Cemetery thing that you do

272
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,031
There's a church at the end of the Seventh Day Adventist salvation not for sale

273
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Freely given

274
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,223
They put that sign up just for this weekend around Georgia when I realized

275
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,623
I need to Google every single thing that goes through your brain

276
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,023
$15 generals and all I wanted to know was how many Dollar Generals are in the United States

277
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
Which stand of course meant that I had to find out how many Walmarts are in McDonald's

278
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,007
Every historical fact in Billy Joel

279
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
We Didn't Start the

280
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
The fire great killing me I think we made it

281
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Domestic

282
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,271
Okay if I ever hear this song again I'm going to cry

283
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,087
What about tomorrow in the car no no

284
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Definitely not

285
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:21,375
Day to Tennessee

286
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
2 with

287
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,447
500 miles left to go in

288
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,727
36 hours

289
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
Do we get kind of diss track

290
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
Big American flag lots of America

291
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,871
Oh that's some good stuff actually

292
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
Why not

293
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,223
We pull into the parking lot of a restaurant

294
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Called Shoney's

295
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
In Crossville Tennessee

296
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
There's a strip of grass work

297
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
People have set up a bunch of yard sales

298
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,183
And right away we see this one guy

299
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Same as Jonathan Joe

300
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
Older chain-smoking

301
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,143
Grumpy Cat made a few if I don't sell it to you for twenty or stand there and bug me

302
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Yeah

303
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Okay

304
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
Take the clock and go but

305
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Charming in his own way

306
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:06,175
And he's selling some things that we're looking to buy an order for

307
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Prince record

308
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
Where we left we a star

309
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,319
Hey do you want us to pick up anything for you along the way and Stacey Vanek Smith

310
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
Really don't know if she was

311
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
Just trolling us here but she said

312
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,047
Did you get me a shaming cookie jar you know the kind that yells at you and you grab a cookie and also

313
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
French rack

314
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
And here in Tennessee

315
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
Are crates of Wrecker

316
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Dollar rate

317
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,983
I feel like we're not going to find that

318
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
French Creek

319
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
What is this

320
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
French

321
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,247
Oh my God Stacey Vanek Smith is Corey my goodness

322
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
Ridiculous that's the only $10 album

323
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,999
No it's at Dollar keep digging every five

324
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Some great rack

325
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
Commodores

326
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
Spreading Pretenders

327
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Pretenders

328
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,679
As long as this has

329
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
2000 MI

330
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Then we need it

331
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,383
We had over the money to Jonathan the guy selling these records

332
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
All right

333
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
We run into a

334
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,063
Problem

335
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
Jonathan

336
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,951
Does not want to sell us his Pretenders album

337
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
Sorry you had to be happy with your two

338
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
Really

339
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
I feel like the sale already happened

340
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:34,495
Yeah I didn't look close enough

341
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Johnson says listen

342
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
This Record really mean something otherwise I really like this band a whole feel of it and see them in concert best ones

343
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,063
I've been to in recent years I'll make a deal with this back and you can take

344
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,135
Any other two records here how about that

345
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
At this point we realize

346
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Two things

347
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,303
We are sitting here being awful to the 68 year old

348
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
Pretenders

349
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
And we are becoming

350
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,959
A living example of something in behavioral economics

351
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,519
I guess we should tell you like why

352
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
So we cover a kendama

353
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,663
Do you want to come that's going on here

354
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,039
But there's this economic term called the endowment effect

355
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
And that

356
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
When you

357
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,159
Okay so I got a little too into the weeds with Jonathan here

358
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
But basically the endowment effect

359
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,255
Is the idea that

360
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,839
The mere fact of owning something makes it more valuable

361
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Jonathan says

362
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
That totally makes sense

363
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
This happens to me all the time

364
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Many times

365
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
If I've got it

366
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,103
It's not worth much to that person with the same thing if he's got it

367
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
Oh how couldn't part with it

368
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
For that

369
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
That's exactly what the endowment effect

370
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
And that

371
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
Is happening

372
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Right now

373
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Because look

374
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
This is not a record that I've been

375
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
For I know one song

376
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,255
The one side owned it for what like seconds

377
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
No way am I giving

378
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
I realize I was being

379
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
Predictably irrational

380
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
And I told Jonathan

381
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
Sorry my bad

382
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
We will take you up on that offer

383
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
So Jonathan gives us

384
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Folk record

385
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Cool ass Wrecker

386
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
Other one by soul singer named Jackie Wilson

387
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
This is

388
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
That say you will

389
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
Is

390
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Killer song

391
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,415
I'm gay

392
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,279
You have to put the pretenders record in your car

393
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
Thank you

394
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
For saving me from myself

395
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:45,567
Yeah but the only one I go home with I'll be happy

396
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
And you know what Jonathan was not just trying to

397
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,135
Get back his Pretenders record this is a good song

398
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,951
I am so glad that Jonathan told us about Jack

399
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
Jackie Wilson

400
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
I feel like

401
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,023
This is the first

402
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,815
Grapevine from this trip

403
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,631
And after getting this awesome record

404
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,447
We are, but we are really

405
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
Yard sailor

406
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,359
But not hipster buying silly stuff yard sales we are in

407
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:25,759
Will you go around here they won't find no better deal than air but after we hit Kentucky

408
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,831
Welcome to Kentucky you were buying so much stuff that

409
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:35,231
It's all sort of became a blur need luggage

410
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
Luggage I got some goblets

411
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,423
But I loved you hated

412
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,007
Welcome to Ohio

413
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,871
120 miles and only 24 hours to go

414
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
And

415
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:57,247
I found a miniature ironing board I've been looking for that for this

416
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,039
Thank you

417
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:04,415
Start justifying things that I definitely do not need no I mean I'd be doing myself a favor

418
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
We bought

419
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,487
So much

420
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,511
Stuff

421
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Day 3

422
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
Our last day

423
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
We wake up early in Ohio

424
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
Only one thing on our mind

425
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,079
Addison

426
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
Michigan

427
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
The end of the world

428
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:31,295
Longest yard sale so tired

429
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:37,695
We ran out of time we have made it almost State wrestling Champs 1989

430
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,791
But we barely had time to celebrate because when we pulled over

431
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
We realized we had a

432
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,447
Where in Addison we're going to take a second to pack up her stuff

433
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Cuz next up there

434
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
West County Fitness early

435
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,359
It is awesome and we're just an hour from Detroit

436
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
There's so much trash in this car

437
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,111
Right now I'm starting to understand how the yard sale I feel like I just don't really want to look at home

438
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Yeah

439
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
Well you bought it

440
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Harvest Vine

441
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,191
You have a lot of glass what is what even is this stuff I don't even remember

442
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
Don't forget your ironing board

443
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,335
I always thought of myself as someone who had great spatial reasoning

444
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,383
Like the baseball bat alone

445
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,247
Even diagonal there's no way

446
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:42,975
We have a pile of stuff here that is not going to fit in our suitcases big decision time

447
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
I think

448
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,887
I think that I can't think about what to do with this stuff until I get food

449
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:56,287
Maybe let's get lunch

450
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
Take me to order some ice cream

451
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,783
We drive just passed Addison and find ourselves a lunch spot

452
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
Cog Freddy's Fries

453
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
It is

454
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,951
Very delicious so we also get dessert

455
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:19,583
And as we eat in our blood sugar levels start Rising we have an ID

456
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Freddy's

457
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,423
Has this big outdoor seating space

458
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,239
A bunch of picnic table lots of people

459
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
Maybe a captive selling audio

460
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,567
So we go back

461
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:34,687
To be ordering window and we ask for the manager her name is Sherry Hollowell what's going on

462
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,527
You're busy we're reporters from New York

463
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:44,415
We just drove the entire 127 yard sale

464
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,719
And we got to go to the airport

465
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,279
And all of our stuff is not fitting

466
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
And I love it

467
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
And we have a very strange request

468
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375

After the break clevver side goes a long way

472
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Leaving Michigan tonight

473
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759

492
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,704
All right red raspberry slush

493
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,312
Back in the parking lot of Freddy's Fries where we're holding our tiny yard sale

494
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,640
We quickly discovered that people coming for lunch

495
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,224
I'm not necessarily interested in a mini ironing

496
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:17,600
All right we'll just come look after you finish your delicious-looking meal for my amazing 70s

497
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
Amber goblets yard sale

498
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,232
Are you sure these are some great goblets

499
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
This is not going well

500
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,608
Before you guys leave you want to look at our stuff especially when it comes

501
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
To your ugly cat cookie

502
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,496
I love this cookie jar and nobody is buying

503
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
All those guys are going around us

504
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,336
So just as I'm thinking

505
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
We might just have to throw everything into the dump

506
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,712
We meet the first two people who are willing to

507
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,736
Talk to it

508
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,808
Oh we got some yard Sailors here

509
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,672
I'm downsizing

510
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,744
Nick James and Tiffany bass are here for lunch

511
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
So

512
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,304
I try to Pawn off my goblet

513
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
You try to sell your bat

514
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,632
What about first self-defense

515
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,984
Which seems very brutal

516
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,776
Nick and Tiffany are like

517
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
We don't actually need any

518
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,616
Cuz we drove a lot of this ourselves the past

519
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
But also

520
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,200
You guys are kind of

521
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Doing this wrong

522
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,760
You know you got to tell a story

523
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
In order to sell it

524
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
Adrian Marcel something

525
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
You need to have a story

526
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
In retrospect

527
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,672
This seems kind of obvious

528
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,072
But this thing that we're doing the feels normal to us because we've been to dozens of yard sales at this point

529
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,120
Is actually a little weird

530
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,960
Like people came to their small town ice cream shop for lunch

531
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:42,080
And they found two random radio reporters in the parking lot trying to sell them

532
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
A mini ironing board

533
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
The thing we were not doing

534
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,456
I was telling all those strangers

535
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
The biggest

536
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,248
We were not

537
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
Tapping into

538
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,832
To the thing that makes the world's longest yard sale work

539
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,904
Connecting 690 miles of yard sales

540
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,976
Turns it from that one off yard sale in your neighborhood that you

541
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
You probably won't go to

542
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
To a destination

543
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,584
Illegitimate thing

544
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
You might plan your family vacation

545
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,448
And where you might buy some

546
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
70s Amber goblets

547
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,520
Alright so we got some

548
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,056
Primo like goblets

549
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
As soon as we start connecting

550
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:20,992
Our little yard sale to the world's longest one we've been on the road for literally a thousand miles

551
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,576
We're going to the world's longest yard sale everything sells

552
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Pretty quickly

553
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
Okay Vine

554
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:32,512
To be clear we were also giving the stuff away at bargain-basement prices to Buck

555
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:36,096
Tupac last like 5 bucks on the goblets to bucks on the bat

556
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
We ended up

557
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
Giving away the ironing

558
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,680
Keyboard all that was left

559
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Was Stacy

560
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,264
No one wants that

561
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
No one

562
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
And it

563
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,968
So sadly would not fit into my suit

564
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,296
I think here's what I think

565
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
You say you're going to take it home

566
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,416
I don't know if it's going to make it all the way

567
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
But I can if I stop

568
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
Some clothes inside

569
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
The cookie jar I think

570
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,168
I can bring it home and we can give it to say to bed excited dancing in the parking lot of Freddy's Fries

571
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
That

572
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:18,848
I'm very happy about that that is a perfect ending to this yard sale

573
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
Where

574
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
That you can

575
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
If you have any awesome yard sale
