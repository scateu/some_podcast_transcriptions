If you want to start or grow your business

00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,680
Michigan

7
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,448

00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,216

10
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:18,432
California has a booming economy and a lot of people are flocking there for job

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,040
But there are not enough houses being built to accommodate all of these new

12
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
People

13
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,392
And because now you have so many people vying for so few available

14
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
Homes and Apartments

15
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952
The cost of those homes

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,000
Has been rising at a really

17
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
Fast

18
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,328
People are dying on the streets

19
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
Because of the affordability

20
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,888
Crisis that's Gavin Newsom

21
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,912
The governor of Calif

22
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,984
And he has a very straightforward plan to fix

23
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
Estates housing

24
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,056
Build more housing

25
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,336
We talk about doubling

26
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,920
Dublin is not going to solve the problem is going to mitigate it won't solve it

27
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
Quadruple

28
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
Begin saw it

29
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
What's the time is would agree with this idea

30
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
Supply and demand

31
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,088
Increase the supply of homes

32
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,368
The price should come out

33
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,952
What building new homes can be very unpopular on the local level

34
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,976
Because it can lead to

35
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,024
More traffic it can put more strain on

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,792
City services

37
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
And it can affect the

38
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
The character of a city

39
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
And ultimately

40
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
The decision

41
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,472
How many homes get built in California is not up to the governor

42
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
It is up to local city council

43
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:20,896
That's who tells developers how many new homes they are allowed to build and so Governor Newsom new

44
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
If he wanted more homes

45
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456
He was going to have to get

46
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,016
Hundreds of City council's all over the states

47
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
On board

48
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
And many of them were

49
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
But he says there was one city

50
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
That was particularly

51
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
I mean the city council just

52
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
Plano

53
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
Not interested

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
They just on their nose

55
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,840
Set the states and Newsome decided to do something

56
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
Drastic

57
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912
He took that City to court

58
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
That's right the state of California

59
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
Is suing

60
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
One of its own cities

61
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Tenacity

62
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
Happens to be

63
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,872
My hometown

64
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
Huntington Beach

65
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,992

Earlier this summer at the indicator Windsor Calif

70
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,328
And we came up with two very different stories

71
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,376
One about the battle over at 4.

72
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Housing

73
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,032
And what about how the very rich are protecting their very expensive houses with private firefighters

74
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:26,432
We put those stories together here and you know if you like what you hear you can head over to the indicator from Planet Money to hear more wherever

Agriculture podcast

76
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
So after the break

77
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,272
Why the governor of

78
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
California sued and idyllic

79
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344

Now onto the show

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,944
Huntington Beach is a Seaside community that is about an hour south of Los Angeles

98
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
And it's known as Surf City USA right there and that is because it has these like beautiful

99
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,184
Iconic kind of golden beaches there beautiful beach

100
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
They are

101
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,816
It's a nice place to grow up and the legal battle that is currently roiling this

102
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
Idyllic Beach City

103
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
It Centers on one Street

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Edinger Avenue

105
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Which happens to be

106
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,032
The street that I grew up on this is getting weird

107
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,664
It's weird right my town on my block and now it's at the center of this lawsuit

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
They could determine the future of housing policy

109
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
For the entire State of California

110
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,112
And I want to get a sense of what this means for the people who actually live there

111
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
So I talked to a long time

112
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
My name is Freddy

113
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,047
Last name is Rafi on and I am your father

114
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
My dad he moved to Southern California from Iran 40 years ago and in that time he has really learned to embrace the honey

115
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
Lincoln Beach lifestyle he can always be found where

116
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Board shorts and a t-shirt

117
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
With his like Maui Jim sunglasses on it

118
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,455
Forehead uninterrupted tan since at least 1980

119
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,527
Really yeah he's just like the ultimate Huntington Beach

120
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
And we met up

121
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
At our old apartment

122
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
On Edinger

123
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,647
Here we are at all six

124
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
Tengo unit 610

125
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
I lived it video

126
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,815
18 years and when we first moved to the stretch of Edinger

127
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
This was not

128
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,679
Anything special I mean the street was known

129
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
For like the old crumbling shopping mall in the

130
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
The corner

131
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Like a bandit

132
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Today though

133
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,383
It's known for a cheek open their lifestyle Plaza

134
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
Luxury

135
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
With all the amenities

136
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
Like the street has just

137
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
Utterly transformed

138
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
And that

139
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,599
All this construction and new development it really

140
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Doesn't sit well with

141
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,463
They should stop they should leave Huntington Beach the way it is

142
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
And go do this thing's

143
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
Other places other City

144
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
It's not Huntington Beach anymore

145
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
And my dad is not the only person who feels

146
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
Anxiety about the

147
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
The community lights

148
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
That Huntington Beach flavor

149
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
That we all moved here

150
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
That's Eric Peterson

151
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
The mayor of Huntington

152
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
He campaigned on the promise to

153
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
Stop the overdevelopment

154
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,807
And since taking office he has been a vocal opponent

155
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
Of Governor Newsome's housing

156
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,719
Thought that there's going to be some Central planning up in Sacramento

157
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,559
That's going to disseminate how every city and county looks

158
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
Right when it's not what we want

159
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
You're not going to turn us into West LA

160
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,055
You're not going to turn us into South Bend anywhere like that when you were talking to

161
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
People from hainan

162
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
There was a sense that the state is trying to turn this

163
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:14,015
Idyllic Little Beach Community into some kind of bustling Metropolis or some sort of anonymous

164
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
Hondo written

165
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
Outdoor lifestyle

166
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
Nightmare about all these

167
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
Buildings that are

168
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,279
Just destroying the character of my Beach City

169
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,887
Things that these concerns are a little overblown not asking for high-rises when I ask you

170
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,959
Be possible just increases Supply modestly

171
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
Show us you give a damn about

172
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,871
The people that are commuting to 3 hours to come in and work in your restaurant choice you give a damn about the

173
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,431
The kids there that can't afford to buy a home there even ready

174
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,783
This fight over my town and my block it actually goes back a few years

175
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Pickles

176
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
City council meeting from 2015

177
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
We don't need a congested City

178
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,487
We don't need giant buildings the previous Council

179
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
Soda City down the river

180
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
This is insanity

181
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
We are outraged

182
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
But that monstrosity

183
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,543
That's under construction at Beach and Ellis these are your people.

184
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,615
Give me very emotional when it comes to

185
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
Zoning policy

186
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Housing

187
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,991
And at that meeting the city council voted

188
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,063
To put a halt on new development on Edinger Avenue

189
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
And that was the moment

190
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Did set this entire conflict

191
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,743
So California has this law that's been on the books for

192
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
50 years

193
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,863
And the losses that every city has to identify exactly how much housing it

194
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
At every income

195
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
And make a plan to build a

196
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
Houses

197
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
By limiting the number of new

198
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Units allowed on

199
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,567
Street tires Edinger Avenue

200
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
Huntington Beach

201
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
Spell out of

202
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
Science

203
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,407
That plan

204
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
For decades though that would not have been in

205
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,015
I mean this lot has gone largely unenforced

206
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
For 50 years

207
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
Cities have never faced any consequences

208
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
Is for naught

209
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
Actually building the house

210
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,439
That changed when Gavin Newsom

211
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
The office

212
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,279
He decided he was going to start enforcing this law

213
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
He decided to start

214
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
With my hometown

215
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,399
We should say Huntington Beach in the state of California

216
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
They belong had an acrimonious

217
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,311
It's a republican stronghold in a deeply Democratic state

218
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:18,175
And the two entities have been suing each other back and forth over a whole range of issues

219
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
4 years

220
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
Mark Peterson thinks that this latest legal challenge

221
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
It's really more about

222
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
Political retribution that is about housing Paula

223
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
It was strictly him going out

224
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
The nearest so many cities

225
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
That aren't compliant

226
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Much worse than

227
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,071
But he's just

228
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Targeting us

229
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
For some reason

230
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,959
Devin Newsome denies that this lawsuit is politically motivated

231
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,311
And he says all this noise at Huntington Beach is making that is just them trying to score political

232
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
My gosh

233
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
This is a bit of crocodile

234
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Tears

235
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Thought of respect

236
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,759
Exactly what they were doing they were intentional and what

237
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
They were well aware of a lot of nothing

238
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,391
Should surprise him about this I think they're finding excuse

239
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
This fight

240
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
Between these two men

241
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,999
It's going to have real consequences

242
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Is For Real

243
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
Remember my dad the one who didn't want to see

244
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
See new development on his blog

245
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,727
Btd6 yes my impeccably well Tans dad

246
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
He doesn't live on that

247
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
In fact he doesn't live in Huntington Beach

248
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
He was forced to move

249
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,711
Shortly after the mares development hauled went into effect

250
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
They raised the ranch really quick in the Bible

251
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,855
Year-and-a-half the rent was raised

252
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
40% near me

253
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:37,535
Any got to point that I just couldn't afford the rent so I had to move out of the area

254
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:42,143
This makes sense right this city limited the supply of housing in that area

255
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
The supply goes down

256
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
Price goes up

257
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,775
That's good news if you own in that area

258
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,567
But it's not good news if your renter

259
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Like my dad

260
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,895
I practically raised welts on my kids here

261
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
And I really like it

262
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
It was a nice place

263
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,087
And they said good City I love Huntington Beach I would love to

264
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
To come back and live

265
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,743
But with the rents going off as much as they are I don't think I ever be able to come back

266
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,607
Darius your dad is a low-income renter who was pushed out of his

267
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
Bike riding

268
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
He is

269
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,007
Exactly the kind of person the governor Newsom has been trying to help with this lawsuit

270
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
Right but my dad is also a

271
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
Fierce opponent of new building

272
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,151
Yeah which is hard for me to wrap my head around

273
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
How old is my dad support a policy

274
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
That is actively against his own interest

275
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
You would rather

276
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,087
If I have to leave Huntington Beach

277
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
To keep the city the same way it is rather than

278
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
Be able to live here

279
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
But see it change

280
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Yes

281
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
This is what so challenging about all day

282
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
I mean people do not slot

283
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,119
Neatly into these little category

284
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
Pro-development anti-development

285
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Pearl affordability

286
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
A huge expanse

287
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
It's extremely emotional and it

288
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,127
And it's where you live is part of your identity

289
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
And identities

290
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
Messi it's

291
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
It's not always rational

292
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
It doesn't

293
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
Fit neatly into an economic model

294
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
Kind of like Edinger Avenue

295
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Exactly

296
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:15,583
Okay for our next story I'm going to head out and hand it off to my fellow producer on the indicator constanza

297
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,911
The guy Ardo coming up after the break

298
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
What hiring

299
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
Super expensive

300
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
Private firefighters

301
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Maybe a good

302
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Deal

303
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,871
Support for NPR and the following message come from Hotwire

King spinal

310

It has already been uneventful summer Impala

311
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
Yeah between the 2020 debate and the president's battle over immigration there's a lot going on when there's news

312
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
You need to know about the NPR politics podcast

313
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311

For a second story we had to another part of California

319
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,463
To check out the booming business of private firefighters

320
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,047
The bird firefighting industry is still pretty new

321
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
A lot of the companies are based in California

322
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
Like firebreak protection

323
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Systems in Ventura County

324
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,495
And you know this do not look like regular firehouses

325
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,335
I like big brick building with flags out front or giant red trucks

326
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,407
Fire Protection Systems is in a strip mall

327
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
Next to a company that installs skylight

328
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,551
Hi hi

329
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,879
Inside there's the specious office and like

330
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Half a dozen big

331
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,975
Beefy firefighter types sitting at the store

332
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
Cubicles look

333
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
Computer screen

334
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
Stop music playing in the background

335
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
Chris Brandi neon supplies

336
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
He's a big guy

337
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Strapping

338
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
Gray hair and mustache

339
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:03,103
Deep tan mucus look like firefighters

340
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,127
Right now it's

341
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Holy dip

342
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,967
Chris used to sell firefighting

343
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,015
Equipment to homeowners and insurance

344
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
Things like sprinkler system special

345
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Flame retardant foam

346
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
But then

347
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
She says

348
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,975
A couple of insurance companies came to him and said

349
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
Hey you know a lot about fires right

350
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,583
So what if we hire you to fight.

351
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
I said sure sounds like

352
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,143
Why not

353
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,191
In fact it's the insurance

354
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
They're really feeling the business

355
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Is a private firefighter

356
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
It started getting serious about it around 20 years ago

357
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
When Wildfire started getting worse

358
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,431
And development in high-risk fire areas

359
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Wheelie started

360
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Taking off

361
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
Karen Bradshaw is up

362
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,063
Professor of law at Arizona State University

363
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
She studies wildfires

364
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,183
Stuff you think of the outskirts of for example Los Angeles

365
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,071
People who are living in the million-dollar homes tend to be those were attacked into these beautiful forested Enclave

366
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,167
Suddenly insurance companies were seeing their most valuable homes

367
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,959
Regularly at risk of burning

368
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,031
So they started hiring their own firefighting

369
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,567
Whose job it would be

370
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Specifically protect their homes

371
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:11,455
Technically all these places are covered by like the city or the county or whatever so

372
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
Why

373
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759

And about a dozen employees

380
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,583
And they deploy three fire trucks

381
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,399
Which don't really look like fire truck

382
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:34,751
They're kind of small like I was just like a regular Truck Yeah

383
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,567
But they're equipped with hoses and a 200

384
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
Gallon tank of water

385
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663

Huge map

393

Yep to all these little green. You see on this map are all our houses that we

394
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Take care of

395
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
Green thoughts are the ones that you cover

396
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
Are there green there's yellow

397
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
The definition of companies

398
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:23,647
When a fire breaks out Chris and his team will get a call over the radio

399
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Did you just hear that

400
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
What is a

401
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
This is a vegetation fire

402
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,815
Okay.

403
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,447
Ron Rice. You said it's on right

404
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Turns out they didn't need

405
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
The fire was already be

406
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,615
But when they do need to respond Chris and his team will

407
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Spring attack

408
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
Drive up to the area near

409
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
The fire

410
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,991
Find houses they are responsible for

411
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
Yellow.

412
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
And do something he called a hot lap

413
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,159
Which involves going around the house and clear away all the flammable brush

414
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,719
And spring special flame retardant foam around

415
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
If the fire comes closer to the house

416
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
Chris and his team will fight the fire

417
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,631
Sometimes alongside the public

418
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
Glee from the guys

419
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
Using most of the same app

420
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Equipment firefighters

421
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
Big jacket

422
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
Helmet axe

423
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
First aid kit

424
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
You know pocket snacks man they get you through the day

425
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,663
Is that right in the pocket snacks

426
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,967
Oh yeah sometimes when you go to a fire we left

427
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,527
We are 42 hours or something like that

428
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
We're out on

429
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
42 hours came home shower

430
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Shave

431
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
Slept a couple hours came back out

432
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Just like the bubble leaf

433
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
But there is one major

434
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,863
If a house is not one of the green or yellow dots on Chris's

435
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
Computer screen

436
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,911
They leave it alone

437
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
Daddy said if the house isn't on my list

438
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
I'm not going to go to

439
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
It's

440
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
Stuff I think

441
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,615
Chris is quick to say that the insurance companies

442
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,967
Have sent them to trailer parks to fight fires they are also two very modest homes it's not

443
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Mansions there

444
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,015
Protecting

445
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,343
And he says the law to protect homes in the immediate vicinity of the

446
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,671
Because you know if those homes catch fire it threatens the insurer

447
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
And he says penis team have saved a lot of houses

448
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,655
We figured we save someone around 21 houses over the last few years

449
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
La Salazar Park

450
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
That would be the pocket

451
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
It's of the insurance

452
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
Chris won't say exactly how much

453
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
She gets paid from an insurance company

454
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
But he says it's

455
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
In the tens of thousands of dollars

456
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
A year

457
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
But definitely less than half a mil

458
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
We did get that much

459
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,367
Well that may seem like a lot insurance companies have

460
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
Clearly decided that it's cost-effective

461
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,975
Did for them to hire Chris and his team

462
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,071
Especially if they're going to be saving this multimillion-dollar mansion

463
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
Karen Bradshaw of Arizona State University

464
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,215
Says more and more pricey homes being built in these

465
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,751
High-risk areas next

466
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
Forested wilderness

467
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,895
Hiring private firefighters is probably going to continue to be cost-effective for insurance

468
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,735
The reason being that Wildfire risk is still quite small

469
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,599
And the value of these homes in the number of these homes is really quite large

470
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,695
Chris says he's already seen his industry grow a lot just in the last couple of

471
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
Have you pulled up to this one house and there was

472
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
Four five different

473
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
Private agencies

474
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Sitting there

475
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
Everybody's in different houses it was

476
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
Pretty wild never seen that before

477
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,263
I really like all the trucks are sitting in front of the house and they're protecting

478
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:24,127
So where is growing up in looking at our houses and there's one of them and I'm like where you guys from

479
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
They're from all over the world

480
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
They also are working for insurance companies

481
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
But now it's not

482
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,111
Individuals have started hiring private firefighters to

483
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
Christmas last year

484
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
When the fires got really bad

485
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
They start getting calls everyday

486
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
Some people begging them

487
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,767
To come protect their home

488
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
He had no idea what

489
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
Charge for that service

490
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,887
So he started calling around to other companies

491
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,959
For 24-hours was like 20000 or 25000 was

492
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,567
NFR year just for the wine

493
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,199
I was kind of surprised cuz you know you said it mean

494
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Palot

495
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
And this just

496
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
Doesn't sit very well with a lot of pee

497
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,391
Write Karen Bradshaw says we have this idea in the US

498
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,719
Firefighters are supposed to be publicly funded they're supposed to work for the

499
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
The people protect us all equally

500
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Not protecting expensive house

501
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,839
Super cheap house or you know

502
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,887
Annie's Mansion before a trailer park

503
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,447
And it becomes a real question which I think is

504
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,031
True in so many places in American society or the government

505
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
Has historically provided some degree of provision of a public good like education but over time perhaps

506
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,759
The government provision of that good has diminish and admits that

507
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:40,159
Private Solutions I private education come up and people become concerned about the differential income effects that result

508
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
And just as in the case with education

509
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Having enough money

510
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
To get a private service

511
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
Instead of the publicly-available service can have life

512
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,375
Changing effects

513
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
Take Paradise

514
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:55,519
The lower-income town in northern California that was burned To The Ground by one of the fires last year

515
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
Thousands of residents last

516
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Their homes

517
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,383
The whole town was basically destroyed

518
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,687
Meanwhile Kim Kardashian's home was

519
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,479
Along with her neighbor's house

520
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,039
She went on Ellen a few days later to talk about it

521
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,319
We were fortunate enough

522
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
I'm blessed enough

523
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,391
We were able to get private firefighters

524
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:14,719
They saved our home and saved our neighborhood

525
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,279
In gratitude for her home being saved

526
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,583
Kim presented Ellen with a giant check

527
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
For $200,000

528
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
Made out

529
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
