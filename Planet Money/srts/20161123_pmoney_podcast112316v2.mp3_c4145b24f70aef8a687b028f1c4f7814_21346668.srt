Our first deal comes from Marianne McCune

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
She's a fantastic radio reporter

58
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,824
I'm back when she was in her early twenties

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
She went two years without paying her federal income

60
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
Then she got the letter

61
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
From the IRS saying

62
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,784
Back taxes and penalties and it

63
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
She called at the IRS

64
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,696
I don't think I knew what deal you could ask for but it was just like is there anyway that

65
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
Like a knot

66
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Payless

67
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,096

68
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,144
247 Elizabeth

69
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,032

70
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
Italian family crest

71
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,128
Neighborhood is changed

72
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176
You know we became friends

73
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,064
So you guys are saying about the old neighborhood on the phone you and the IRS lady whatever

74
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
She said all the money I owed

75
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
Getting defiled

76
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,696
The penalties and the interest on that

77
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
I didn't have to pay

78
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
The huge

79
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Really

80
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
That's amazing

81
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,144

82
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
I feel like you just got so lucky

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
I think I did get really lucky

84
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
I think it made it easy

85
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
But I also think

86
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
You can

87
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
Make a human connection with somebody and ask

88
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
4 something

89
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
And you may

90
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Get what you ask

91
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,184
Nick Fountain Planet Money producer and I'm in a little Alleyway sitting on a tiny stool

92
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,583
Is Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam I'm eating a delicious soup that will probably cost about a dollar fifty and

93
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,983
I'm here is because I'm on my honeymoon with my beautiful wife and one of the reasons we chose Vietnam for a honeymoon

94
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:32,383
Because we got an amazing deal on the flights so I'm always checking these flight deal websites

95
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,783
One of them is called Airfarewatchdog they send an email alerts and another one is on Twitter it's called the flight deal

96
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
And what they do is they scour Airlines websites for the best deals my wife and I got

97
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
From New York to Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam and back for $400.26 per person

98
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
There may have been one too many layovers but it was well worth the trip

99
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,359
Just to be clear bike one too many layovers Fountain and it took him and his wife

100
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
30 hours

101
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663

110
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
It is

111
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
This happened in India a couple weeks

112
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,215
On the night of November 8th

113
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,799
If the Prime Minister got on TV and said starting at midnight

114
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,127
You cannot use 500 and 1000 rupee notes

115
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Divisive

116
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Used to go trade them in at the

117
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:45,855
A really big deal because a thousand rupee note is only worth about $15 so we're talking about most of the cash

118
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
In the country

119
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
And he did this

120
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Is part of a

121
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Crime-fighting measure

122
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
August criminals operating

123
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
Cash and these are some of the larger

124
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,375
People had to take their old Rupees to the bank with ID

125
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
Fill out a form and change their money

126
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
And there was a limit

127
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:05,311
You can only trade in 4,000 rupees per day that's about 60 bucks

128
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
And that's a

129
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,431
Low amount and the idea is that criminals would be stuck with these

130
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
Duffle bags full

131
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223

162
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,783
As soon as I go to the bank do they first thing I was

00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063

3

170
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,399
Hours and after this heinous family realize that they needed

171
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,983
A plan or they were not going to get all of their cash changed out in time for

172
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,311
So what they decided to do was distribute this cash

173
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
Cross a whole bunch of relatives and have

174
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,687
Each relative convert the maximum amount of cash they could

175
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455

So far his family has changed at about half of the cash

182
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815

Hello this is a message for Richard calling about the silver eagle bus

186
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295

End of message

191
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
A couple months back I was getting a

192
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Bunch of message

193
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,535
Like that's about this bus that I was allegedly

194
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Selling

195
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,631
And for the record I am not selling a silver eagle bus

196
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,727
Which is like a giant tortoise like if I pass one on the highway I would assume

197
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
It was carrying

198
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
Like a rock band from the 1970s

199
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
So I called the sky Patrizio back

200
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,431
And I was like why do you want to buy this us

201
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
And he said

202
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,015
That he is a professional

203
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
Tango dancer

204
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
It would be the time go back

205
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
The Tango bus

206
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,951
To hold a portable stage

207
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
I ride with the bus

208
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,815
Alabama festivals somewhere wherever we go

209
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,911
He said that he already travels a lot for work actually he was about to go to the Mojave Desert

210
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
Doing a photoshoot

211
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,287
We're going to do some nude photos and others are going to be

212
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
Embarrassed

213
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
Traditional Tango clothing

214
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Yessica plane tickets

215
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
Rental car hotel and he said he thinks it would be a better deal overall to just spend 40 or $50,000

216
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
Buy a bus

217
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
End

218
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
I wish I could sell them on

219
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,695
Genius that was deal number 5

220
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:39,071
When we were working on this show we asked plan of many listeners to call in with deals

221
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Here's one of those

222
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887

Farmville Virginia

225
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,239
I got a rare

226
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,847
$400 snare drum of the yard sale for $8

227
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
And now I'm

00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
EBay attic

229
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,807
Number 7 is a Vegas deal it comes from Planet Money cheap gambling correspondent Keith

230
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
Samantha Vegas with a couple buddies

231
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,391
And we come back one night to our

232
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,231
Terrible hotel room from a night of gambling and drinking and whatever

233
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
And

234
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
My buddy Jeff goes and takes a shower

235
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
Comes out of the shower completely naked

236
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:18,751
And I say to Jeff Jeff if you go down just the way you are to the casino floor and get a $1 chip

237
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
I will give you $100

238
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,871
Instantly he's gone door closes behind him

239
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,687
We got in the hallway we look for him he's gone

240
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
5 minutes

241
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
Hey babe it's Jeff

242
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Completely out of breath

243
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
Completely naked

244
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
No $1

245
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
So

246
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
I didn't get my $100

247
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
Okay how we doing we're 8 minutes in

248
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,583
We've done 7 deals little behind going to try and pick it up

249
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,935
Deliberate we've got Jess Jiang she's a Planet Money producer she called her

250
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,983
Cable company earlier this year

251
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
The woman that I talked to said

252
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
We can offer you anything over the phone

253
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
But she said

254
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Between you and me

255
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
What you should do is go into the

256
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,271
Because if you go into the Time Warner Cable store

257
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,855
Don't see that there's a chance you might quit Time Warner Cable

258
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,927
Maybe they'll offer you something better there

259
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
So few days later I went into the store

260
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,303
And I said I'm considering leaving Time Warner Cable

261
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
Can you give me a better deal to

262
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,143
Keep me to stay

263
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
And they said

264
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Yes

265
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,751

00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,943

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799

336
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Very disturbing about this

337
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119

I would have to come up with this kind of money every 5 days and I mean

365
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,255
I was a poor student and

00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,095
Like I I don't know what to do cuz I don't have that kind of money

367
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
And if you don't test

368
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
You can die

369
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
So she googles the words

370
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Cheap test strips

371
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:42,591
And what comes up is this underground marketplace of inexpensive diabetic

372
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Test strips

373
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
That we couldn't fake

374
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
Four preps stolen

375
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,015
The Chelsea discovers that this whole deal is because of the way health insurance

376
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,599
If you have coverage for diabetes you can get boxes of test strips

377
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
For cheap

378
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,671
We talked to a guy named Trey who

379
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Saved if you up

380
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
At about 20 extra box

381
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,791
What do you put on a different kind of testing regimen

382
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
He decided to sell his strips

383
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
To someone on

384
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,911
Goodnight in a McDonald's parking lot

385
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
And the

386
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
I pulled up in his car was there

387
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
I came out with

388
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
The bag for the test strips and

389
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
Get his wallet for the money in

390
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Was like

391
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,687
We're doing a geriatric drug deal

392
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
Geriatric drug deal

393
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Make me feel old

394
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,367
It is legal to sell your diabetic test strips

395
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,439
As long as they don't come from Medicare Medicaid tray made about

396
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
300 box

397
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,047
Eventually made their way into that underground world

398
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
The Chelsea found

399
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,631
Middleman Internet ads bargain deals

400
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,447
Chelsea bought eight boxes for under a hundred bucks

401
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
It was like

402
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
You know having a life sentencing

403
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Realizing that there's a cure

404
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
And Chelsea thinks

405
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:51,455
You know there are other diabetics out there as desperate as I am

406
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,295
So she buys a few extra actually started with $200

407
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
6 boxes of test strips

408
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:58,879
Seldom

409
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
Buy some more

410
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,743
And pretty soon Chelsea has a garage full of test strips

411
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
And that's when I

412
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
Decided the

413
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
Create Pokemon

414
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Glucomart

415
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:12,447
Chelsea Nails between 10 and $20,000 worth of diabetic test strips a month

416
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
People can't afford the retail price

417
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,895
Yeah I'm looking at this tour bus you guys have online

418
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943

00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
2

420
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,063
And I'd like to know a little bit more about it

421
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,415
Spider-Man is going on tour in a silver eagle bus in 2017

422
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,183
Mark my word

423
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743

430
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871

Hello I'm Charles from

435
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,159
Chicago and the most interesting deal I had was when I was driving an ice cream truck

436
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,487
Last summer some kid came up to me and treated me a hot dog

437
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
For an ice cream and I gladly accepted B

438
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
Because I forgot my lunch that day

439
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863

I do I want to eat in your own words on tape

443
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
Okay my name is

444
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,087
Haviland Smith, retired CIA

445
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
A retired CIA office

446
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,695
Is bringing us a b final deal of the show

447
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,535
Allen Smith work during the Cold War and his job was to recruit Soviet

448
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
It's the spy for the US

449
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
It was a tough job

450
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,935
They were hostile they were paranoid they were very suspicious of all Americans

451
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
It was a problem

452
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,263
Establishing relationships with

453
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,567
Early in his career pedal and learned a trick

454
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
Kind of emotional deal people would make

455
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,199
The Soviets were the ones who named it

456
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,015
They have a term called bone throwing

457
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Brushes cost

458
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,623
Bone throwing consisted of

459
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:11,231
When you're trying to establish a relationship with someone hostile

460
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,535
You you you tell him something

461
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
Revealing about yourself something

462
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Personal

463
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
During the Vietnam war

464
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,447
Haviland might tell a Soviet connection about his own doubts

465
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
It's about the u.s. involvement in

466
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
How are you struggling

467
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,335
A lot of the time he says that could really change the dining

468
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,639
The guy looks at you and he says

469
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,479
Jesus here's another human being a he's got problems just the way I do

470
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
And

471
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
He's dealing with them

472
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,087
And maybe I could talk to him about some of my

473
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,231
Because sometimes it's Soviet acquaintances would respond bye-bye say complaining about their bosses in mosque

474
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
The kind of thing they get in trouble for

475
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
Or if they talked about it with other

476
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
So you're both vulnerable to each other

477
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:52,191
We aren't there yet but he's vulnerable

478
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
How much more objective

479
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
I thought you're emotionally vulnerable

480
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,359
He's vulnerable to like getting sent to the gulag

481
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,431
That's a good asymmetry

482
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735

Sommore

488
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,119
Self-protective you are

489
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
The less you're going to get out of a relationship

490
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
And I've always found it

491
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,799
The more I could knit about myself in my photos in my shortcoming

492
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,639
The more I became a real person to two other people so yes

493
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
I feel used

494
