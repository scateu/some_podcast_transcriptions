00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:02,048

00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,680
Who was our internet back in 2000

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,824
Stick around because we have a quick update at the end of the show but this story is about something

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
Very extravagant

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,640
Very expensive

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,920
And very elusive

9
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,224
A sundew

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,992
Hey

11
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
So we're here finally

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
We're here how do you feel

13
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:32,256
I feel like I'm going to drop actually okay well don't drop in the store Stacey I feel like that is bad

14
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,024
Tactic

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,816
Like all Epic Heroes

16
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,096
I have a plan

17
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,424
I thought I've been going over time to say I think I'm ready

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,448
What are you going to say

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,264
Okay I'm going to say

20
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,848
Hey give me a Birkin bags

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
The Birkin bag

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,712
It's a purse made by Hermes the French luxury brand

23
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,296
Perkins average around $60,000

24
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,368
You can get a starter Birkin for around ten

25
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
There are luxury goods

26
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,952
And then there is the Birkin

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
For 30 years the Birkin

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
Has been the

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,072
It bag for Rich and Powerful women

30
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,376
Elizabeth Taylor carried one

31
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,680
Kate Middleton Kim Kardashian has one

32
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
Victoria Beckham currently has like a hundred of

33
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,312
This is the bag that proves you've made it

34
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,848
That you are on the top

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
There are people with Birkin bags

36
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
And there are the rest of us

37
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,040
Apparently even just getting to see one is kind of a big deal they want to show them to anyone

38
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
And this is why I'm so nervous

39
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,392
I'm about to walk into an Hermes store

40
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
Walk up to a salesperson

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
And ask to see

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
A Birkin bag

43
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,280
Just like my own personal night

44
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
I find those stores

45
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Really intimidate

46
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
Okay you got this good luck

47
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,960
Thanks man I'll see you soon bye

48
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,264
My God I feel so bad for her

49
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,872
14 minutes later Stacy finally emerged from the store

50
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
There she is

51
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,320
Hey you're back how'd it go okay

52
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,696
Breathe it's okay okay it's over

53
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
Yeah

54
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
So they didn't have

55
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
Surprise surprise

56
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,888
This is the strange thing about Birkin bag

57
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,728
They always seem to be mysteriously out of stock

58
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
And

59
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
This is no accident

60
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:27,200

You go on a quest to see one of these bags

63
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:42,048
And find yourself in a world where the normal rules of Commerce are totally upside down

64
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,400
Also how you get someone to pay $60,000 for something that is

65
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Be honest

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,240

Wednesday Martin Wednesday Surfer

75
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,192
First name can remember the exact moment she started whining

76
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
A Birkin bag

77
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,032
It was right after she moved to the Upper East Side

78
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,080
One of the wealthiest neighborhoods in New York

79
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,688
And she was walking down the sidewalk and she saw this very well-dressed woman walking

80
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,528
And we were the only people on the sidewalk

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,088
And she walks toward me

82
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,904
Rather than keeping to the right she was

83
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
Slowly but surely

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
Walking start of at me so that I had to move further and further to the right

85
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,400
And I was eating more and more sidewalk territory to her

86
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
Until finally I found myself

87
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Stopping

88
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
Right up against this garbage can that she had sort of

89
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
Walked me into

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,688
Then she brushed right by me with her handbag

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
That

92
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,504
With a dominance display

93
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,576
And that woman used her handbag to do it

94
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
She's pretty sure it was a Birkin bag

95
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,184
There a very simple boxy handbag

96
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,512
Cut all the larger side and they had a padlock on the clasp

97
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
And when this happened Wednesday did not think

98
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
Oh my gosh women's neighborhood

99
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Crazy I need to move

100
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
She thought

101
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
I need one of those fat

102
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,543
That was the moment when I realized that

103
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
Handbags are really important in New York

104
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,175
And if I want to play ball on the Upper East Side

105
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
I better stop walking around

106
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,807
With this white plastic bag with a couple of bananas in it

107
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
I better Saddle Up

108
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,927
Back in 1981 the CEO of Hermes was on

109
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
A plane with the French Act

110
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Birkin

111
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,047
Emptying complained she needed a weekend

112
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
The Birkin bag was

113
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
Wanting to buy a Birkin bag

114
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
That's easy

115
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
Even having the money is

116
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Really hard

117
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
Finding one to buy

118
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
That

119
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
It's Tricky

120
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
Even for professional

121
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
Michael tonello ran into this

122
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,967
He had a business buying and selling luxury goods

123
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,783
One day one of his customers came in and said

124
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
Hey can you tell me one of those Birkin bags

125
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,647
I started asking for Birkin bags

126
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
But they quickly told me that they didn't have them

127
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,047
And I couldn't figure out why was there a medicine how many Birkin bags

128
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
It was

129
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,375
You know a bag that are metals made and sold

130
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,983
Michael started talking to other people who are trying to buy Birkins and they were all being told this

131
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:30,751
Same thing

132
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
We are sold out

133
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,847
But we can put you on a waiting list

134
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
I'm 2 years

135
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
4 years waiting list

136
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,759
At one point there was saying that there was a waiting list to get on the waiting list

137
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
And it just all seem kind of crazy to

138
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
If you got it bad that people are willing to pay to

139
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,927
Tens of thousands of dollars for

140
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
Why won't you sell it to them

141
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Hermes

142
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Has an X

143
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
Explanation this is

144
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,119
These bags take a really long time to make

145
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
They just can't keep up with demand

146
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
First of all some of them are made out of

147
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
Very exotic leather is like crocodile and ostrich

148
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
And Birkin bags are hand-sewn

149
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,639
Pipe select artisans in the south of

150
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,711
Air masses that is why they're always sold out

151
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,039
I ran this by Josh weltman he's working advertising

152
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855
For years he was one of the producers of the show Mad Men

153
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
4like list

154
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
These are totally handmade

155
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
It takes

156
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:27,327
12 hours to make one people have to Apprentice for years in order to

157
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
It's the level where they can make

158
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
This product

159
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Is

160
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
Special

161
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
No

162
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
I'm sorry it's not

163
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,127
Josh says that every man has wanted to make more bags

164
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
They totally quid

165
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,735
30 years to train those who like art

166
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Edison's

167
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,623
Either the reason for the extreme scarcity of the Birkin bag has nothing to do with how it's made

168
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Spartan Market

169
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:57,023
Josh's the whole idea of a luxury good is something that not everyone has

170
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,375
And there are a couple of ways you can make sure but not everyone has your product

171
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
You can jack up

172
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
Price light companies do this

173
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,263
Watch companies luxury car companies

174
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
Course the Birkin bag

175
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
But air mass is going to step further

176
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,383
They don't just charge a lot for the

177
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
They make sure that not everybody

178
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Can get one

179
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,503
Hermes birkin bags really hard

180
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,831
Why you should go through all these weird rituals to get your hands on one

181
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,183
But Wednesday Martin are upper east Sider was determined to join the burger

182
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,815
Don't you consulted an expert I conducted myself according to tribal code

183
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,911
And I went to a wise tribal Elder

184
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Other

185
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,263
Didn't look like an elder she looked very young for her age

186
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
It was her friend's mom who owned Burger

187
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,615
Actually she owns several.

188
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:48,223
And her friend's mom called the seals person she knew at Hermes and quotes

189
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
Affected an introduction

190
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
She told Wednesday to send her

191
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
Her husband to the Hermes store

192
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
To introduce himself to the salesperson

193
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
Apparently Wednesday would have a better shot at a Birkin

194
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:02,047
If her husband said he wanted to buy it for her

195
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
As a gift

196
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
She had to show up in person

197
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,935
And I need this lovely saleswoman who said

198
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
I hope you'll understand that

199
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
We'll have to wait

200
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
Even Wednesday

201
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,151
From the right neighborhood with the right connections doing everything right

202
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
Even she can get a bag

203
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
And this goes beyond scarcity

204
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Rimowa stores try to make

205
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,319
Welcome trend

206
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Special

207
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
Hermes the strategy seems to be

208
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
You reject angular

209
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
Josh Waldman The Advertiser says

210
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
That is intentional

211
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
They play hard to get

212
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
That's how they seduce you

213
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
It almost sounds like they're kind of like

214
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
Humiliating

215
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
It's a hazing process

216
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Beijing doesn't like

217
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
Create resentment

218
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Create Bond

219
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,151
Once you're in that makes you feel that you're

220
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Worthy

221
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
It gives you identity

222
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,247
I mean think about this

223
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,319
Hermes has created a $60,000

224
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
Purse

225
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
And instead of convincing you why on Earth you

226
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,951
Pay that crazy amount for a Birkin bag

227
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
Hermes has people

228
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
Trying to convince

229
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Them

230
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
To let them by 1

231
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,143
Like please let me spend $60,000 at

232
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Liquor store

233
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
And is Major sound like

234
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,239
Does insane marketing tactic

235
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
Used on insane people

236
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
Way too much money

237
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,383
But Josh said that you can actually find this tax

238
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
Everywhere

239
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,759
The basic example is nightclubs like when they have that big line out front

240
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,575
And Josh's Elite colleges do the same thing

241
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,719
The thing that they publish about Harvard and Stanford and all the ivy League's is the ratio of

242
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
How many people they

243
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Let in compared to

244
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
The amount of people that they reject

245
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
It's not a high status

246
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
School

247
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Unless it's

248
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Super select

249
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,055
Everyone wants to be part of a club that's just out of

250
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
That's the

251
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
The soft

252
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,663
Part that were poking out in advertising

253
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,271
You know it's a little Sinister that they're like marketing right to us but it's like we're helpless

254
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
They didn't put the soft spot there

255
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,903
You know you're the one that has the edge

256
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
You know

257
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
But

258
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
They're just letting you scratch it right

259
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
I mean

260
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
That's a service

261
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
Wow

262
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,679
You're good at your job

263
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,239
There is of course a very obvious cost

264
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
To the strategy of turning pee

265
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
People away

266
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
Poking at that soft spot

267
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,687
Fermez it means that every time someone walks into a store

268
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
And ask to buy a Birkin bag and

269
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
They say no

270
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,343
That is a $60,000 sale they are not making

271
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
They don't get greedy

272
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
I guess that's what I'm

273
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:43,327
I'm sort of a weird thing to say about a company that's charging $70,000 for a bag and not getting greedy pays off

274
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,655
Josh's the reason that the Birkin has been on the top of the

275
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,959
Handbag food chain for 30 years

276
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,263
Is exactly because it's so

277
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
Hard to get it keeps people wanting more

278
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Of course to make money

279
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,175
Hermes does eventually have to sell a bag

280
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
To someone

281
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Wednesday Martin

282
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Did actually fight

283
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
It is totally random way

284
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
Her husband was on this business trip in June

285
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
Japan and he's on her message

286
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
So you went in and asked

287
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
Do you have a Birkin bag

288
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
He said no sorry we're out

289
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
He said I need one

290
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
They said we're out

291
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
And he said

292
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
I need

293
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:24,031
And Japan is an extremely polite culture

294
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
After they told him a few times that

295
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,663
They couldn't do that and he insisted a few times but

296
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,479
In fact they could and he wanted them to

297
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
They must have just thought

298
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,319
This man is so rude

299
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
And this is so awkward

300
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,183
The best way to get him out of here might be to just let him

301
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Buy one of these

302
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
So

303
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
They produced a bag

304
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,607
And remember our luxury buyer Michael tonello

305
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
He also ended up getting a Birkin

306
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
In a totally different way

307
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,519
He was in an Hermes store buying a bunch of scarves for

308
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,847
And I piled up about 10 or 15 or more scarves

309
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
And as we were walking to the

310
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Register to pay

311
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,807
Just sort of nonchalantly like I mean literally was an afterthought I said to the salesperson

312
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
We don't do you happen to have

313
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
A Birkin bag

314
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,463
And the sales person said oh I don't know let me look in the back

315
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
What did you think

316
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
I thought

317
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,095
She's going to go in the back room and come out and tell me they don't have any Birkin bag

318
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
Instead she came out with a big

319
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
Orange Box

320
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
A Birkin bag

321
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
And she let him buy it

322
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
For $20,000

323
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:34,175
It's been Michael goes across town to another Hermes store and ties the same thing

324
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
It totally work

325
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271
Michael had accidentally cracked the code

326
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,599
Buying a bunch of really expensive stuff at the Hermes store first

327
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
Then casually ask for a bag

328
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
I don't got one

329
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,999
I suddenly realized it was a lot like chemistry class

330
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
The order in which you put

331
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
The chemicals into the

332
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
Beaker

333
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Are very very important

334
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
Somehow Michael had

335
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
Turned the Hermes shopping experience

336
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,543
Back into a normal conversation

337
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
Have a pet theory about this

338
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:08,735
I think that after he bought all those thousands of dollars worth of scarves the sales people at Hermes felt great

339
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
They felt like they owed him

340
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
And he wanted to be nice to him

341
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
Like in a normal store

342
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,671
And that is the moment when Michael asked for the Birkin bag

343
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
He caught them at a weak moment

344
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
DC United

345
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
We still haven't seen a broken though

346
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
So when we met Wednesday we asked

347
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
We could see her

348
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,887
And we have that

349
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,191
Major moments after the break

350
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,007

359

Back so I've actually never seen one

360

M&M shirts

361
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
This feel kind of momentous

362
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
That is the genius of Hermes

363
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,983
Even just seeing a Birkin bag

364
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Just like a big deal

365
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,591
She's very clean lines very simple very

366
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
Very under scary plane really

367
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
It's Dairy

368
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:15,807
Plain and simple and understated mean if I just saw this on the street and I didn't know what a special bag it was

369
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,695
I wouldn't like look at it twice

370
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
That bag

371
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
So underwhelming

372
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
It is like a

373
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
Recessively underwhelming

374
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
It's ugly and boxy

375
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,655
And leather doesn't even seem that nice

376
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
But as I was looking at it

377
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,519
Caught myself trying to see how special it was

378
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Kept thinking

379
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
People pay $60,000 for this bag

380
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
This is a special bag

381
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
If I can't see that

382
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
I have the problem

383
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Can I touch it

384
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,551
I feel like it's almost like a religious

385
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,135
I feel like I don't know there really is some weird or about it

386
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,231
This is really embarrassing to listen to right now

387
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,535
Religious Relic aura

388
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,351
What happened to me I was reporting a story

389
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:06,751
About bags but it's hard not to get sucked in even when you know all the mechanisms behind what's going

390
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,823
Going on and Wednesday Martin said she knew how I felt

391
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,639
Did you ever feel like a little

392
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
Suckered by Hermes

393
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:21,087
Going through all this are you kidding of course only every single second that I was doing it I thought

394
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
I have

395
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
Lost it I felt ridiculous

396
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
Tell us about it all the time

397
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
And I still do

398
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
I still hope

399
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,583
To come out of this interview sounding like a person

400
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
With a sensor

401
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Humor

402
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,191
Rather than a zombie but in a sense

403
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
I did become a zombie

404
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
Still Wednesday says

405
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,383
Having a Birkin bag really did help her feel more at home on the Upper East Side

406
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,247
She never got pushed off the sidewalk again people who didn't have berkins approached her to ask

407
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
She got in it

408
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Could hold it

409
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,623
People who did have Birkins wanted to exchange Warsaw

410
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
She said the back

411
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Copper feel like she had a

412
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Please in this new neighbor

413
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
Person to tonight or Quest was done

414
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
Kid seen a real life Breaking Bad

415
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Touched it

416
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,631
And we decided

417
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,215
To celebrate we would Retreat to our own world of luxury

418
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
In this part of town we can probably only afford a copied you like want to go get a coffee

419
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
It really does taste better

420
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:27,135
Story first aired in 2015 and the Birkin bag is as coveted as ever this spring

421
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,975
The Bergen set a record for the most expensive handbag ever sold at auction

422
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
It was a Christie's and someone paid

423
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,375
$379,000 for a Birkin bag of Call of Duty

424
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
Himalaya

425
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,239
It is a sort of silvery white bag made out of crocodile skin

426
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,543
Padlock is made out of white gold and there's some

427
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Diamonds on there

428
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
It's very shiny and

429
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
Cost as much as a house

430
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,783
This episode was produced by Alex goldmark the rear end was produced by Kesha mihailovic

431
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,391
