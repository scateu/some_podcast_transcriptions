Just around the corner from our office is a weird New York City landmark

And I digital numerals always changing

26
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
Is the current

27
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,672
National debt of the United States of America

28
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
To the dollar

29
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,328
It's been up for almost 30 years the location keeps changing is very skyscrapers go up

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,168
But it's always in the streets around Times Square and it is always Counting

31
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,728
As of today the US national debt

32
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Is

33
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,032
Prepare yourself for a big number

34
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
20 trillion

35
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,664

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968

00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
Dollars

39
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
And the number is

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Is rising

41
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,368
In fact the tax plan signed into law late last year

42
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,648
Is expected to cost

43
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,464
About a trillion dollars over the next decade

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,536
That's according to the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation

45
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,328
Other analysts put the cost at

46
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Twice

47
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
That one always.

48
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,424
More deficits

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
What that means

50
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
We're going to need a bigger billboard

51
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
And a bigger understanding of what day it is

00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I Am Robert Smith today on the show we are going back in time to tell the history of

Cat in America

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
There's some Alexander Hamilton of course a story about how Congress created the scariest stupidest way to

55
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
Amanda Georgette and that one time the single time our country had a resolution to pay off all the

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,984
And 16 by the way it's episode Richmond VA in 2011

57

First up

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Really basic question

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
What exactly is the national

66
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096
Debt

67
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,400
It's kind of think of it as one

68
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
Think because it's actually a bunch of promise

69
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
Millions and millions of specific promises

70
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
The government has made

71
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
Two specific people

72
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
The government spends more than it takes in

73
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
Every year

74
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
That is called

75
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Deficit of yearly deaths

76
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,320
And the government borrows the difference from International financier

77
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,136
People who know the government inside and out

78
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
People like this purse

79
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
My name is

80
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
L c Smith

81
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
And I am

82
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
7

83
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
And 3/4

84
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
I have an OLCC

85
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
A friend of mine and in fact she is your daughter

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,520
Yeah but that's not important right now what she is is a creditor of the US government

87
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
Listen to what she discovered in my drawer

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
United

89
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
State saving bonds

90
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:28,896
$50

91
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
Why did you let the government that money

92
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
To keep safe

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,064
Yeah that's actually right you did that used your money

94
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
Dubai things like maybe

95
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,648
A rivet on a fighter plane or something

96
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
I don't have it

97
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,464
The thing that holds the plane to

98
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
Her International financiers are so

99
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,424
You know it's funny even at 7 years old she's somehow and I can tell it is

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,496
She somehow managed to look at this thing the savings bond

101
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
And understand what is most fundamental about government debt

102
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,664
It's safe it's completely safe us has never gone back on it

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Promise

104
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,992
She could get that $50 tomorrow with interest

105
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
If I let her

106
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:11,648
It's up to understand what the debt is you got to add up all the Elsa's of the world all the

107
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Fireman funds

108
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,512
Central banks with lots and lots of treasury bills or savings bonds

109
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,839
In their drawers and even if you don't have the bond in your drawer

110
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,911
Are you have effectively lent the money to the government somewhere

111
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
Maybe it's your checking account

112
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Savings account

113
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
That guaranteed interest that you got

114
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Probably back by treasury bonds

115
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
A government that

116
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
And we're always hearing about how

117
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,455
China holds over a trillion dollars of us bonds Japan

118
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,015
Many many governments around the world

119
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,807
And when you add up all those promises

120
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Aldo's

121
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
Different people in institutions

122
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,439
The US government has said hey we're going to pay you back

123
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
That

124
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Is the national debt

125
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,815
Today we're going to explain how we got into this mess

126
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
Where are the staircase

127
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
What happened when we tried to pay it off

128
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
Who came up with this whole

129
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
Debt ceiling idea the first place

130
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
That turned out

131
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
We've been fighting about the den

132
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
Something United States was born

133
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,383
Okay we're going to do some old-timey music here

134
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Good day in February

135
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
Fare Thee Well

136
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,391
Okay we're back in Revolutionary War 2 pictures of you

137
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Couldn't tell from the

138
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Spot-on impression

139
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,999
This is what the first debate over the national debt

140
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
It support remember that the US debt

141
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,863
Wasn't something that just happen automatically

142
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,471
United States is very first few days made a conscious decision

143
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
To Habitat

144
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
Tissue response

145
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
Promise to pay it back

146
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
I spoke with Robert E Wright

147
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,919
Is a professor of political economy at Augustana College

148
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
In South Dakota

149
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,551
What really happened is we fought a long and bloody Revolution

150
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,111
Against the world's greatest superpower

151
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,415
And racked up

152
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
80 million dollars in debt

153
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Doing so

154
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Couldn't we said

155
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
Sorry folks it's a revolution

156
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
We're wiping out of the deck

157
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,191
We could have but thankfully we didn't

158
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,007
And we didn't because of a man named Alexander Hamilton

159
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,335
He was the Secretary of Treasury the very first one

160
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871

Baystate fundamental choice

162
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
If we don't take responsibility for the day

163
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
All those farmers

164
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,599
Atlantis money and the soldiers we didn't pay in the French who went this money

165
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
The rest of the world won't trust us

166
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,207
They won't lend us money we won't be able to trade

167
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:26,815
Will be stop United States will be stuck living off whatever we grow here in our Farts

168
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
And back then

169
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,911
Grow that much we brought much of our consumables

Then the other nations will feel more included

190
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
The Hamilton

191
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
Crow that was fighting with Thomas Jefferson

192
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
Because Thomas Jefferson had a very

193
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
He felt

194
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
The debt

195
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
With extremely

196
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Dangerous

197
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
When you hear the speech that Jefferson gave at least the

198
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
HBO series game

199
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,031
It's a speech I feel like with very little change could be given

200
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,383
States are indebted to a central Authority

201
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,479
Increases the power of the central government exactly

202
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
I fear a revolution would have been in vain if Virginia Farmer's to be held in Hall to a New York Stock Chopper

203
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
Who in turn doesn't talk to a London Banker

204
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
Opportunities for

205
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
Avarice

206
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
Adoption

207
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
Certainly prove irresistible

208
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
And this fight between

209
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
Northeast bankers and

210
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,871
The rest of the country this has been going on for

211
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
For 200

212
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
It's going on today

213
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
Now Hamilton won out initially

214
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
Play the United States

215
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
Accepted it's dead

216
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Promise

217
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,951
But Professor Robert Wright says that most politicians of the time they felt much more like Jeffress

218
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
Okay fine Hamilton will pay off our old debt

219
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Let's not make a habit out

220
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,631
So what the battle was really about was

221
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
How quickly to pay off the debt

222
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,215
Now whether to pay it off or not

223
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
And

224
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,799
I have to give full disclosure here I spoke with

225
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Professor rights

226
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,431
And he told me that he gave his son a unique name he named his son

227
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Alexander

228
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Hamilton

229
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Was

230
00:08:54,527 --> 00:09:00,415
Right how come the other day he told me

231
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,231
Alexander Hamilton is right

232
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,815
Gets in his view of course Hamilton is Right forever

233
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Wow so

234
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,399
For the first forty years or so of the

235
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
We lived

236
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
In Hamilton's worth

237
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
The nation headed day

238
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
Manageable

239
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:21,407
Banks and bankers in the Northeast florist we did trade with Europe and everybody trusted us

240
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
The country grew and

241
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
Pretty soon

242
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
UF that that issued by the US government

243
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
Wisin is one of the safest investments in the

244
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
This was Alexander Hamilton dream

245
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Until

246
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
1 president dared to pay it off

247
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,143
Circular next chapter in The Amazing life story of the US debt January 8th 18

248
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
35

249
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
Can we put on character again

250
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:52,895
All the big political names in Washington DC have gathered to celebrate the President Andrew Jackson

251
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,479
It was the anniversary of his win at the Battle of New Orleans but

252
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,807
There was bigger news that night a senator stood up

253
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
He raised his glasses he said gentlemen

254
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
The national debt

255
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Is

256
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Paid

257
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,279
Hot sauce around the room

258
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,327
Find me the national debt was Zero

259
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
It was a big deal

260
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:16,191
Scottsdale Garden fix-up she writes about financial history any

261
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239

The extraordinary life of

263
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
In times of the national

264
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
This was another American accomplished

265
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,175
But the wheel actually paid off our national debt know the country never done that before

266
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
Andrew Jackson becomes president

267
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,295
The death had become sort of this routine thing and it actually

268
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,903
Follow the cycles that business textbooks tell you a government that should

269
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Drink bad time

270
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
Hamster Wars like the War of 18

271
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:44,863
12 ordering economic slowdown the country borrowed basically borrowing against their future prosperity

272
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,447
And then sure enough when the hard times were over and

273
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,751
The economy was doing well the government would

274
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,519
Payback

275
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
The debt that it had borrowed

276
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
Always maintaining at least

277
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Some level

278
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
Andrew Jackson

279
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Did not

280
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
Like this normal

281
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Routine

282
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Trader jacks

283
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Politics

284
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Is very person

285
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
He hated not just

286
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
The federal that he hated dad

287
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
At all

288
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
That's HW brands

289
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,951
He's a professor at the University of Texas

290
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
Anybody biography of Andrew Jackson

291
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,279
Call his life and time

292
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
A toughest great story about jacks

293
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,911
Before he was president in the wild west of Tennessee

294
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:24,543
And he was quite the land Speculator you know he would often get paid and land and he was trading on these things

295
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
At one point he trades

296
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
Some land

297
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
For some debt passed on by somebody else

298
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,967
Well this debt goes bad

299
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
And Andrew Jackson's left holding the bag

300
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
You got this massive dad

301
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Worthless paper note

302
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
And

303
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,695
This drove him nuts affect the guy did the deal with it went to jail

304
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
So when Jackson runs for president

305
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
He knows the enemy

306
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
Banks in the national debt

307
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
He called it the national

308
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
Curse and the voters just

309
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Eat this up

310
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:54,495
Andrew Jackson had an actual plan to get rid of the dead but he also got

311
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Very lucky

312
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
What he took officers around

313
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
58 million dollars of death

314
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
That the US government owed

315
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
And one way that you paid it off

316
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,015
There happen to be a huge real estate bubble going on

317
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,063
And rather than bailout the banks

318
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,903
It turned out that at the time that you owned a lot of land in the wilderness

319
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
They sold it at these

320
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Slated bubble price

321
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Which brought in

322
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
A lot of money which went

323
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
The paying off the debt

324
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:23,167
Injection was I don't give a credit ruthless on the budget and he blocked every spending Bill he could

325
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Highway government buildings it was

326
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
Vito Vito V

327
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
After 6 years in office

328
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
He paid it all off it was all gone

329
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
But Jackson

330
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,199
Friendly faces technical problem that no other president has

331
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
We're faced either before or since

332
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
What do you do

333
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
When the government has more money than it needs

334
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
What do you do with the Surplus

335
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,815
No back then there's no income tax you couldn't just give everybody a refund there wasn't really a way to return money

336
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
And what he decide to do was to

337
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,263
Divided among the states according to population is the only time that's happened so Andrew Jackson gets rid of the debt

338
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,567
All of a sudden the countries running a surplus

339
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,151
And we all live economically happily-ever-after right

340
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
Not exactly

341
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,735
How long did the good times last at last exactly one year

342
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
1

343
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Beautiful year

344
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,647
The State Banks apparently went a little crazy with the Surplus

345
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
They're printing massive amounts

346
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
A paper money

347
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
And that land bubble

348
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
I mean the one that helped jacks

349
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Bounce about to get rid of the debt

350
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,607
The limbo went out of control

351
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
And then like all bubbles

352
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:26,911
It popped

353
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
It was a huge

354
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Crash

355
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
And the

356
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
Beginning of the longest depression in the mirror

357
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
History lesson lasted six years before

358
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Economy began

359
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Grow Again

360
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,151
And we're not saying

361
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,479
Every time you pay off the debt you're instantly going to cause a massive

362
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Depression

363
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
But there was a clear lesson here

364
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,855
No matter how much you hate the debt

365
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
Eliminating it does not guarantee that you're going to have

366
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
Good time

367
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,511
Even in the early eighteen-hundreds the economy was

368
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Far too complex

369
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,631
And it turns out that having the debt come back was pretty useful for the United

370
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,495
There was after all a civil war to pay for and a bunch of other economic downturn

371
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
The 1900s were full of them

372
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,359
It look like it was no end to the amount of debt the country

373
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Cricket Akon

374
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,175
But that's not the end of the story

375
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199

Chapter 3

386
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
Politicians

387
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Could not

388
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
Kill the debt

389
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,127
But they decided one maybe we can tame it

390
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,223
Is he dead in United States was not just getting bigger it was getting more

391
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Wax

392
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,855
World War 1 Congress have to approve every little bit of borrowing

393
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,671
Susan Irving's with the government accountability office

394
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,231
I mean you know I want to borrow money to build

395
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Answer pressure with gold

396
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,559
The Congress and they would

397
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
Literally approved

398
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,631
The form of the security

399
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
Purpose of the security

400
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
You know

401
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,263
What the duration was going to be what the interest rate was going to be

402
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
So this could take all day long you could say Bridges

403
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
Is post offices

404
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
A canal through Panama

405
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,431
If you look at the early Appropriations Act

406
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
They're completely Aramark

407
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,831
I'm looking early Appropriations act so much for suing the horses for the Department of EX

408
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Really

409
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Very detailed control

410
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,951
It is so hard to imagine just

411
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
Congress or not

412
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:33,119
Finance professional sitting there and every single thing the government wants to buy they have to decide

413
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,519
How much data issue what the interest rate would be will it be a five-year Bond at 3.8% or

414
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
10 year bond at 4 point

415
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
2%

416
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
So hard to imagine

417
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:50,015
Is that what actually shocking is that for over a century they were able to do that they're able to keep it together

418
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
But by World War 1 it was just

419
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
Too much stuff it was too complex

420
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
You think about

421
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:02,815
The number of decisions that go on during the war you know suddenly if they're going to have to approve every single one

422
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
You're coming you're not once a year

423
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
Not once every two years

424
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,703
You're coming instead of constantly oh now we need to borrow

425
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,751
Up to so much to build up more tank

426
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
You know you think really

427
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
At some point

428
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,919
Jeff sheer volume of transactions overwhelmed

429
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,295
And begins to drive out the ability to do so thoughtful discussions about big policy

430
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,647
And Congress loves do thoughtful discussions of big policy so

431
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
They delicate

432
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:32,767
They delegated authority they told the treasury Department in 1970

433
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
Very sad

434
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
After that that you know

435
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,655
Why don't you all figure out how much borrowing mean

436
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
And how you're going to do

437
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
But Congress doesn't just

438
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Give the executive branch

439
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Lots and lots of power they do not

440
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
Now so they say okay

441
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
We're going to give you this job

442
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
Of figuring out what bonds

443
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
What the ratio

444
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
What interest rate and all that stuff

445
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
We're not letting you go now

446
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
We can have a ceiling

447
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
You can only borrow up to this

448
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Amount

449
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
An upper lip

450
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,999
And if you need to do more if you need to borrow more money

451
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,303
Come back and see us and we'll decide

452
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
Whether or not to raise

453
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,399
But there's something crucial to understand here

454
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Nothing gets

455
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Bought

456
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
By the federal government

457
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
Unless Congress says

458
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,823
I mean in the Constitution the power of the purse rest

459
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
With Congress

460
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,503
So the debt limit doesn't actually limit the spending that would be unconstitutional to limit the spending if they say

461
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Safety check

462
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,063
Yeah I think it is his big game of

463
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
Mother may I

464
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
Yeah that old kids

465
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,903
Congress has the treasure

466
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
You Are by Pink

467
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,487
Treasury looks and it brings up the debt limit

468
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,303
And the treasury Department have to come back to Congress and say

469
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
Mother may I

470
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,911
Buy a tank and raise the debt limit

471
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
Encounters with boats and says

472
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
Yes you may

473
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
What's so ridiculous is

474
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
All the treasury is asking approval.

475
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
To do is

476
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,919
Spend the money that Congress has told them

477
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:55,967
Words

478
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Congress

479
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,831
Says go spend this money and then acts all huffy

480
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
But spending the money Congress approved

481
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
So maddening

482
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,511
And it's something that pretty much no other country

483
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Ghost

484
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,327
They don't go through this whole rigmarole

485
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
Simply approve spending and

486
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
Implication the borrowing is just

487
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
Implicitly

488
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471
Approved as well

489
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
But

490
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:22,079
In part that's because there isn't the separation between the executive

491
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
Like the treasury Department and the legislative branch

492
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
The Congress

493
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,759
The debt-ceiling turns out to be not so much something to slow the debt

494
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,575
It's a sign of good old American distrust

495
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,415
It's a way for one branch to basically give the hard work to somebody else

496
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
I don't really care

497
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
So in a sense the debt-ceiling was acid

498
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,119
Congress did not have to spend all of its time worrying about

499
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:50,751
Bond issues indurations and interest rates use this new freedom to come up with

500
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,567
The sort of economy we see today all these efficient

501
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
Forms of issuing various lengths

502
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,407
The dad and using the market to determine

503
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,711
The interest rate that is paid on the bond

504
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
All these things

505
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
Basically make it easier for the government and cheaper for the government to get money

506
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
But the debt ceiling

507
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,415
Did not do its fundamental Mission it did not in any way

508
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
Pain the growth

509
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
International

510
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,999
Every year

511
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,327
More than once a year the treasury Department has come to Congress

512
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Instead

513
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,375
Mother may I

514
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:22,239
Increase the debt ceiling so that I can borrow the money to buy the things you already told me to buy

515
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
And Congress would say

516
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
Yes you may

517
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
And then the debt goes up

518
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
Depression

519
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
World War

520
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,455
And then starting about 50 years ago

521
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
The debt explodes

522
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
Happened is another word for a psycho

523
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,135
The debt goes up during bad times and goes down is

524
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
Paid off during Good Times

525
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,047
Just Administration after Administration Democratic Republican after Democrat after Republican

526
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:46,815
The debt

527
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:53,215
Just gets bigger and bigger during good times and drink.

528
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
