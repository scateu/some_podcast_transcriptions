1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,816
Just a quick note that today show is a rerun

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,352
It's a show about a big

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:07,936
Bet and since the show aired back in 2016

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,216
Stepbet concluded

5
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,288
At the end today will have an update on how the bat works

6
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,384
Carl Lewis has known Warren Buffett for a long time

7
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:23,040
We've been friends for how many years 33 1614 at 50 years

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
50 years

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,136
Loomis is a reporter she worked for decades at Fortune Magazine

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
Warren Buffett of course

11
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,952
CEO of Berkshire Hathaway

12
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,744
Legendary investor also

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,048
Third richest man on the planet

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,584
What kind of stuff do you do together

15
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,376
What we play bridge

16
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,704
He's an avid online bridge player

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,056
And when the computer breaks down at drives him crazy

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,360
Warren Buffett just like your grandpa

19
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,128
Only rich

20
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
Much

21
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
Much rich

22
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,760
We called Charles Loomis because of the story she has been deeply involved in

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
For a number of years now

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
The story about a bit

25
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,880
It seems like you're sort of the

26
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,160
The bookie

27
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,560
No I wouldn't say that I would think of myself as the biographer

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Of the batch

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
I'm still going to call her the book

30
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
She is not the Boogie

31
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,216
She said the story the BET starts back in 2006

32
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
It's at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting

33
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,056
Which is this big thing every year

34
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,176
It's like this capitalist Woodstock that would have texted call me that's like the unofficial

35
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
Joke meme

36
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:28,832
Thousands of people fly in Buffett is up on this stage talking and the subject of hedge funds comes up

37
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,416
You know hedge funds like investment firms for rich people with the

38
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
Dalian phds working crazy long hours

39
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,768
And buffeted those guys

40
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,840
They are not worth the fees they are charging investors

41
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,144
So he says I'm willing to make a bet

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,960
I can pick an investment that will beat the Hedgehog

43
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
I don't nobody

44
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
Ever

45
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,080
Realize that anyone would pick him up on this bed

46
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,176
You certainly wasn't going to do it for a small amount of money

47
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
I knew you want to make a

48
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,112
Declaration by the size of the bet that this is a serious matter

49
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,208
If you guys from the headphone World hear about this Challenge and they say sure will take you up on it

50
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
On January 1st 2008

51
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
They make a ten-year bet

52
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
So how big is the bed

53
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,120
$1000000

54
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,728
It sounds like a lot of money

55
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
It is

56
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
Hedge fund guys been on hedge fund

57
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
These groups

58
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
I'm super smart

59
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Elite investing

60
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,992
Buffett for his side of the bed key does not pick a few stocks he doesn't even take his own company

61
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
He picks one of the most

62
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
Brainless

63
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,832
Boring Investments theories

64
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,208
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob Goldstein and I'm David kestenbaum

65
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
Today on the show

66
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,792
$1000000 bet over a very deep

67
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Which is better

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,888
A group of really smart money managers

69
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,216
Or the simplest stupidest investment idea in the world

70
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,008
We asked each side

71
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
What are you thinking

72
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,456
This message comes from NPR sponsor Capital One

73
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
Capital One is reimagining banking

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,064
I offering accounts with no fees or minimum

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
What's that can be opened from anywhere in 5 minutes

76
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,648
Capital One

77
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
What's in your wallet

78
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
Capital One na

79
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,560
This is not just a bit fitting a billionaire against a bunch of head

80
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,888
If you have any money invested in the stock

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,448
If you have something socked away for retirement

82
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Kids college fund or whatever

83
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,568
You have taken aside in this bed whether you know it or not

84
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
We wanted to understand both sides

85
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
Let's do the Warren Buffett

86
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
The weapon he chose in his battle again

87
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480
The hedge funds

88
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,040
The simple brainless investment he picked

89
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,368
Is grated far from Wall Street in Malvern Pennsylvania

90
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
Is created by this man

91
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm probably the cheapest guy you'll ever meet in your life John Seibel

92
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
How to buy anything

93
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,816
How old are these pants you wear

94
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:52,704
Yeah I'd say fifteen 15 years the sweater was that an LL Bean that's probably only about 8

95
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Bogle as you may know founded

96
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
Company called Vanguard

97
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,360
Name by the way after a ship in the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars

98
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,944
Yeah you walk around up the office is out there in Malvern and you feel like

99
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,296
They have bought every single oil painting of every old naval battle in his

100
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
There is barely a picture that does not have a ship

101
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
That's the way it is we like ships

102
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
I saw this one painting that was just an ocean of the others once just a notion you like know that is the view from the

103
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,191
That simple brainless investment that Warren Buffett picked in the bed is called

104
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
An index

105
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,055
John Bogle created the first Index Fund Back in 1970

106
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,895
He had just read this article by a famous economist named Paul Sammy

107
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,711
And what's Henderson wrote in this article was

108
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
He could not find any good evidence

109
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
That professional investor

110
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,367
People whose job is to pick stocks

111
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
You couldn't find any evidence that they were

112
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Any good

113
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
If you took a bunch of professional Envy

114
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
Look at how they did over a long time

115
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
And you took the average

116
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,399
They did not beat the mark

117
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,239
Like when you hear on the news the stock market close up 1% today

118
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,567
You'd be better off investing in that stupid measure of the stock

119
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Then paying someone

120
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
To try to beat

121
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
Samuelson wrote that maybe quote

122
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
Most portfolio decision-maker should go out of business

123
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Pick up plumbing

124
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Teach Greek

125
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:15,647
At this point John Vogel has been in the business for 20 years since he graduated from college

126
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,511
He has basically been one of those people who Samuelson says should go out of business

127
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
But he takes

128
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
Samuelson's arguments

129
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
In fact he decides

130
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
To check the numbers in South and I do the man

131
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,727
I go to these old books of Investment Company performance

132
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
And I added up each column

133
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
Ghana average

134
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,151
35 years and he found that Samuelson was right

135
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,039
In fact for the investment funds he looked at when you added in the fees they charge they didn't worse on average than the stock

136
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,623
And you could say well I just won't pick a bad

137
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Investment fund

138
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
Pick a good one that can really pick the right stock

139
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
That turns out to be very hard to do

140
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
Stock Pickers who do well one year

141
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
They don't always do well the next

142
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,167
And there've course some who do well for a few years in a row

143
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
But you don't

144
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,751
You would expect that if everybody was just randomly

145
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
Guessing you know if you had a thousand people flipping coins a few of them are going to flip heads 10 times in a row Vogelsong

146
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
This and thought

147
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
So what are we

148
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,271
And at the end of that article that he'd read by the famous economy

149
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
There was the suggestion

150
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,879
And he basically said the cut through his more elegant

151
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Words

152
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
With somebody somewhere

153
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
Please start an index fund

154
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
And I thought

155
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
Why not me

156
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,119
Start an index

157
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,495
Bogle figured she would just create this super simple index funds that people could invest

158
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
He wouldn't pick stocks he wouldn't say

159
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,359
I think this company is great I'm going to buy their stock

160
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
Avoid that other company cuz I don't like them

161
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,527
You was just going to make a fun that was a collection of every stock in the stock market

162
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,647
Not every single stock but the biggest 500 companies on the US Stock

163
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
So if you doing this today apple is the biggest company

164
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
You buy some of that

165
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
Yeah and then you know whatever

166
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:03,935
GE possible company you buy that too but a little less in proportion to its size and on down

167
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
500 company

168
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
It's called an index.

169
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
Because it is just mindlessly tracking

170
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
In a stocking

171
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,663
Actually the index that you hear on the news all the time

172
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
The S&P 500

173
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,271
Is in the S&P 500 closed up a quarter of a percent

174
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,623
So if the stock market if the S&P 500 has a good day

175
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
Your index file is going to have a good day

176
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
Has a bad day the next one's going to have a bad day

177
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
It is not trying to do anything tricky

178
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
BOGO create this in 1970s

179
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
Annie's ready to open it up to

180
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
The first Index Fund ever

181
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
This is a fun for everybody

182
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,751
You can put in a small amount of money or a lot

183
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
I'll go get the bunch of big investment

184
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
Used to go out to their clients

185
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
Here's this great new thing

186
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
You want in

187
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,223
How much money were they hoping to get a hundred fifty million dollar

188
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
How much did you get

189
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
11 million dollars it was a flop

190
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,367
Investment firms go back to Google and they say

191
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
Nobody wants this thing

192
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,487
And I said what I meant we have the world's first Index Fund

193
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,535
We're going to keep the 11 million will do our best

194
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
Investors don't really like this idea

195
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,423
Also the investment industry does not like this idea

196
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,751
Cuz it's an insult to everything they stand for in there trying to do

197
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,151
At this point in the interview at this moment in the story BOGO points to the wall play some hanging on the wall right by where we sit

198
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:21,759
Go over there that's the first reception from Wall Street

199
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,319
Wait that's an actual poster your point ass

200
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
Came out in 1976

201
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,207
He's playing at a poster that he says a brokerage from printed up back in the seven

202
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,559
Has this big picture of Uncle Sam and it says help Stamp Out index

203
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
Index funds are unamerican

204
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
On America

205
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,959
I get it right I mean one of the things that makes America great

206
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Is that

207
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
People work really hard

208
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
How to do better than average

209
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:49,407
If you buy an index fund you are buying something that is designed to be average

210
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
That is guaranteed

211
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
Never to be better than average

212
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,575
And nowhere else in your life and no other important

213
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
Sing would you go for a burn

214
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Do you know if you're going to

215
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Going to have surgery

216
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
Would you be like okay I just want to make sure I have an average day

217
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
No no red you would

218
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,351
You would call every person you know you would do all the research you could

219
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,167
Find a surgeon who is better than average

220
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,239
And it just makes so much sense that if you're picking a stock

221
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
There's got to be somebody out

222
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
Out there who knows something

223
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,383
Things you can say this is a better company to invest in than that

224
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,223
Somebody called the index fund of the quote pursuit of mediocrity

225
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:28,831
Somebody else called it a formula for a solid consistent long-term loser

226
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Google keeps the index

227
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
Anyways for the world

228
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
Come around to his way of seeing

229
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
A year goes by

230
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
And then another

231
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
A decade past

232
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
So you been up there for

233
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,191
10 years with the greatest idea of your life and and where are you

234
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
0%

235
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
He's rounding down

236
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,615
All of the funds out their index funds are like

237
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
0.4%

238
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
A decade

239
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,759
The idea of the electron did finally start to get on the 9th

240
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
What are the reasons

241
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
Index funds head very low

242
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,951
Didn't think about it this way you know if you're running a traditional fund

243
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,767
You have to pay people to pick stocks Panther

244
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
Read reports in French numbers in

245
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
Fly out to meet with the CEO and visit the factory

246
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,983
If you're running an index fund do you don't have to pay people to do any of those things so

247
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
You can charge investors lower fees

248
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,335
If you take a typical stock fund today

249
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
And you invest say

250
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
$10,000

251
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,735
They're going to charge you a fee of $100 every year

252
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
The Vanguard index fund

253
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
They're going to charge you five

254
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Dollars

255
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,111
In recent Years A lot of people have

256
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Okay

257
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
I give up

258
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
A bunch of money has flowed into index

259
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,351
We wanted to see what giving up looks like so we went to the room where they run their index

260
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,471
I mean it wasn't much you could not like it was quiet there a few computers

261
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
Could have been like any office

262
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,335
There's a handful of people in there and they're very intentionally

263
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Not

264
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Picking stocks

265
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,223
It doesn't seem boring it does feel like giving up essence of boredom

266
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
I'll kiss eat it

267
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
If you're in investing for excitement

268
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
You are a damn fool

269
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:11,231
Yeah you're watching the market everyday up and down hundred Point 200 300 400 Point swing

270
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Day after day

271
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
It's exciting

272
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
But it's meaningless

273
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,935
So that is the story of the boring super simple investment that Warren Buffett

274
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
For his side of the bed

275
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,007
And to be clear he actually picked

276
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,591
That very fund the Vanguard S&P 500 Index

277
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,151
Now for someone from the other side of

278
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
The

279
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
Humans can win

280
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
We can do better side of the

281
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,319
His name is Ted site he's he's worked for years in the hedge fund world

282
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
He heard Warren Buffett's challenge in figured

283
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,207
I know some really smart people who can do better than average

284
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
I thought I had a rare chance

285
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
At the catch somebody like Warren

286
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,375
I'm potentially being the Patsy at the poker table

287
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
I thought you said

288
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
To catch him being wet

289
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
The Patsy at the poker table

290
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
This is the summer of 2000

291
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
Inside e-sens Buffett

292
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
A letter

293
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,615
Like an actual letter in an envelope with a stamp

294
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
Old school

295
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,943
He says he's interested in taking me other side of the bed

296
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
And so

297
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
Let's talk about what steaks you propose

298
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
Might

299
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,415
Table Stakes might be over dinner yours might be a little higher than mine but let's let's see what happens

300
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
Little while after that

301
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,255
If I do get this email and there's a PDF attached

302
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,559
He opens up the PDF and what happened is

303
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,631
David is taking that letter and just scrawled some notes on

304
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
Then somebody stands it in and sends it back to him

305
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
So they can go back and forth for a while

306
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
Start negotiating a

307
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,335
Safe to say he was comfortable with higher Stakes than I was

308
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
You're you're making a bet with

309
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
One of the two or three richest man in the world

310
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Attract

311
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,295
They settled on that Million Dollar Bet

312
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,367
Buffett pick the Vanguard S&P 500 Index

313
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,183
Fighting for his Partners picked a collection of headphones

314
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,255
Buddy's knows all that data that John Bogle

315
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
Mention about how stock Pickers can't be tomorrow

316
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
But these headphones they do more than stop

317
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,471
Yammy they're incredibly Elite incredibly smart people and you know they

318
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,775
They can sell shares short they can bet against

319
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
They can get in and out of the market

320
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,103
They can invest in derivative

321
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,711
Some hedge funds are filled with quants mathematicians former physics types

322
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,015
They are not naive about what they're doing

323
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:16,671
Excited to spend his career working inside this world this world of people who believe they really can beat the market

324
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,999
He started out at Yale helping manage the schools in Downey

325
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:25,631
That particular endowment the yell endowment is run by this guy who has been beating the market for decades

326
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,191
Study says when you go to work with that guy everyday

327
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
You realize

328
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
He is not lucky

329
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
He is really really good

330
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
You know who else is really good he says

331
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
The person on the other side of the bed

332
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Warren Buffett

333
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,527
Another way of framing the question is do you believe that Warren Buffett has skill

334
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,439
Or is he just an analyst because there are so many people who are picking stocks he just happens to be the guy who's out

335
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,791
And what I would tell you is that when you spend time with Warren

336
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,887
And you spend time with many many many other money managers

337
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:03,007
You can come away with a very high degree of confidence that if Warren started

338
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,311
Investing For the first time today

339
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
She would outperform in the future

340
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
Sears you're sure you're not.

341
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
Checking yourself

342
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
In what way

343
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
He's a charismatic guy

344
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,039
Ameda me you think this guy's great

345
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
It's it's not the charisma.

346
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Temperament

347
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
Discipline

348
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Insight

349
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
I know that all sounds like very vague managed

350
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
The question is like

351
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
I keep wanting to go back to the numbers

352
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,007
Cuz I ate are you meet people and they've they've done well the last X years or maybe they've the one person's done while their whole life

353
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
You know

354
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,103
And so you tend to think that person has something but

355
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,663
But maybe not maybe they're just lucky

356
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
Well I think that's the Eternal question in it

357
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
The Eternal question in in

358
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
The 10-year

359
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
Million Dollar Bet over the Eternal question investing

360
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
Is now almost at an end

361
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,743
It started January 1st 2000

362
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
Here's how it's gone since

363
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
The first year 2008 with 8

364
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
Terrible year for 1.

365
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
Terrible year for the

366
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,239
As you probably remember that was the year of the financial crisis

367
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,079
The stock market index fund got ham in a terrible time

368
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
Worst time to stop

369
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,455
By early 2009 things were looking really good for the hedge fund size

370
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
4/10 ID

371
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
We were way ahead

372
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Like what to what

373
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
The market would have been down

374
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
About 45%

375
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,951
And hedge funds were probably down

376
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
About 25%

377
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,839
Self I'm imagining two Runners on the track like your Runner is really kind of pulling ahead at this

378
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,679
It's safe to say our runner was

379
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
Haven't moved much

380
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,799
And the market Runner had gone backwards

381
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
A few miles

382
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,407
The next year that was a good year for Buffett

383
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
Author the year after that

384
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,503
After the after that the next man kept beating the Hedgehog

385
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,551
That stupid simple investment

386
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,599
Was better than room folds of really smart

387
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,439
Where we stand now as of the end of 2015

388
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,743
The index fund is up 66%

389
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
The hedge funds

390
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
I'm only 22 /

391
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,071
It's a huge gap

392
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,119
You're not even close

393
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Not a track

394
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,751
There is not much time left the BET and soon

395
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,311
December 31st 2017

396
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,151
Titus says the only way the hedge-fund could win at this point is if

397
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
There's like another

398
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,967
Huge stock market

399
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,783
The crash and he says he doesn't want to see that happen

400
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
Are you bummed about

401
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
Probably having lost this pet

402
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,647
Little bit

403
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,207
You had a chance to beat Warren Buffett

404
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,303
Yeah with the odds in my favor and then play out the way I thought it would

405
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
You thought the address

406
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,167
I still think the odds were in my favor

407
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,983
He actually says he would take the BET again if he could

408
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Deepika go back to mm

409
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,895
He said it's essentially a fluke that the stock market has done as well as it has over the past 8 years

410
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,967
So you're saying you made the right that you just got unlucky

411
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,575
That is how I feel about going to win cuz he got lucky

412
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
I think he did end up on the lucky side of the distribution

413
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
Isn't it also possible

414
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,559
That is just very very hard to

415
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
To beat the market

416
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
It's not possible that's a truth

417
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
What's your advice to ordinary people who do not have a lot of money

418
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
I want to

419
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
Put some of the money in the

420
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
I think they should index

421
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,223
From the hedge fund side of the bed

422
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
You know

423
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,183
Like I actually think his whole position frankly makes makes some sense like I do think there are some people out there

424
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
Who really can beat the mark

425
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
We're not just getting

426
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Somebody

427
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,327
Got it but you don't

428
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,399
For me when I'm deciding what am I going to do with my money

429
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,447
I don't think I can figure out

430
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,031
Who that person is I don't think I can pick the next Warren Buffett

431
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,103
So full disclosure here getting near the end of the show

432
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
I put my money in index

433
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Me too

434
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,247
With the exception of the dollars in my wallet basically everything is in the news

435
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
Yuan to do around here

436
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,111
You do it all the time in real life

437
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:07,487
Yes it drives me crazy when I'm talking to a friend or someone at a party in there like

438
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,559
You know my mom knows how to pick stocks she knew IBM was going to do

439
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Degrade

440
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
I just drive

441
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Chris Lake

442
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,959
They were just lucky

443
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:22,335
That doesn't prove anything with your Charming cocktail party come out

444
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,455
So all right you don't think you can pick the next one. I don't think I can pick the next one

445
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,039
Also one other person who doesn't think he can pick the next Warren Buffett

446
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,087
Warren Buffett

447
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,903
If you're not in a public letter last year Buffett

448
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
Describe the instructions

449
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,231
For the money he's leaving to his wife and

450
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
And he said

451
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,559
To invest almost all of it in quotes

452
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Ready

453
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,143
A very low-cost S&P 500

454
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
Lots of people are taking Warren Buffett

455
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,567
There are now trillions of dollars in India

456
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:59,711
But there are many trillions more infants where people are being paid to fix that

457
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
In other words

458
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,551
Most people are still hoping they can be better than that

459
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:10,207
The show first aired back in March of 2016 when the bat was still going

460
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,279
Tibet ended at the end of 2017

461
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
After the break

462
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
Who won who lost

463
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Etcetera

464
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,751

As expected Warren Buffett won the BET heads

475
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Society's laws

476
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:03,455
By the end the S&P 500 gained an average of 7.1%

477
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Per year

478
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:07,807
The hedge funds made only 2.2% a year after

479
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
They got just

480
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
Clobbered

481
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:14,719
Prophetess that the winnings be donated to a charity called Girls Incorporated of Omaha

482
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:20,095
And the group use that money to turn an old Convent in the housing for young women transitioning out of

483
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
One last thing

484
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,471
There's a reason that we chose this particular episode 2 rerun today

485
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Last week

486
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,567
John Bogle the inventor of the index fund

487
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
He was 89

488
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:38,271
Planet Money is daily podcast the indicator did a whole episode about John Bogle and his legacy on January 7th

489
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,583
Jacob I got the Ford Code as I wanted

490
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,167
Okay I think I know what I'm going to do the first one details about the bet

491
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,751
Both sides actually put some money into a fund paid for that

492
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
Bigfoot in half

493
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,615
The money will go to charity the winner gets to decide which charity will get

494
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,455
Call the number to if you wondering why the market is so hard to beat

495
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:12,831
Please listen to episode 644 where we try to weigh a cow no idea what the next

496
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Codeine number 3 is that

497
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,440
Hedge funds and pets IDs would point out that

498
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,840
They are not necessarily out there to beat the market they are just trying to be a different kind of things you invest in so that in

499
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,656
Year the stock market goes down they don't do it that

500
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
True other win this bet they're clearly betting against a stock

501
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,288
Market Cota number 4 but yes I think it's a fair point

502
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
Cota number 4

503
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,736
I just wanted to point out that even in John vogel's family Dumbledore the guy who invented the index fund this is not

504
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
I resolved question his son

505
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Is a stock

506
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
