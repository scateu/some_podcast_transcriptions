Presenting this mess

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,632
When it comes to investing

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,912
We all have Quest

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,472

Tips and information about investing

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104

10
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,016
Ian purkayastha tasted his first truffle when he was 15 years old

11
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
It was out of the fancy restaurant with a friend's family

12
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,136
The server came over and said okay we have a

13
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,976
Eye specialist for tonight and it's a black for ravioli with a foie gras sauce

14
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
And

15
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,536
It was music to my ears

16
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,096
So I should explain why a fifteen-year-old boy was

17
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,656
This excited by black truffle ravioli

18
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,240
And family had moved to the country and and it started learning to

19
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
Forage for mushrooms

20
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,336
And for foragers truffles are almost

21
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
Mythical

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
They're really hard to

23
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
Find the groundhog round

24
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,712
They're only found in the wild

25
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,760
Nobody has ever figured out how to culture

26
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,088
And nobody has figured out how to make anything else

27
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,368
Taste or smell

28
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,696
Quite like that there's only one thing the tastes and smells

29
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
Like a truffle

30
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,536
And of course truffles are ridiculously

31
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,560
Ridiculous

32
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,608
Ian ordered the Truffle dish

33
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,424
You know it arrived it was steaming it was

34
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
It was amazing

35
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,544
They were shavings of truffle on the top if you cut one of the ravioli in half

36
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,384
They were chunks of black truffle and the ravioli

37
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,992
I mean if it was earthy with snotty was mysterious

38
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,040
Is unknown flavor that I never tasted

39
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
That was it I mean it was like

40
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
Such a revelatory experience

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
You know I can t remember like

42
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,304
You know where I parked the car yesterday but yet I remember everything about this

43
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,888
It was to this day the best dish I've ever had in my life

44
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,680
Ian became obsessed

45
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,264
He took all his savings and use it to buy a kilo of truffles

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
Italian website

47
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,360
But then when they arrived you realize he had bought way too much

48
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,176
Who took the extra tried to sell it to restaurants

49
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
In town

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
I showed up on the doorstep with this

51
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:02,368
Bag of Truffles and a scale I bought at Target in an invoice book from Staples and

52
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
I said hi

53
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm eating I have some truffles would you be interested in buying some truffles

54
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
I don't know if it was the novelty of this

55
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,888
Get out back tooth 15 year old kid walking in the door

56
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168
The backfill truffles

57
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216
But I sold him I made a profit

58
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
And that moment is why we are standing in a walk-in refrigerator in Queens at 11 in the morning on it

59
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Tuesday

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
Cracking open a shipment of white truffles

61
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,248
The Ean has just flown in from Italy

62
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,064
So how much money is in this box

63
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,696
I don't know $20,000

64
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
Yep

65
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,048
$20,000 that's about 8 lb

66
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:47,936
Truffles and he's going to sell all a pound by 5 p.m. today that's a restaurant start their dinner rush

67
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216

Hustled his way to some of the finest kitchens in New York

73
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Selling

74
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
We battled traffic

75
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:10,976
Parking cops Smuggler's penny-pinching chefs and the cruel mistress of time

76
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Also we try to figure out

77
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
What it is about truffles

78
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,376
That makes people pay so much for them

79
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:23,008

Before and can go in southeast

88
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
He has to make sure that they look up

89
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
He cut open the box just covered with

90
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
Us custom stickers

91
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
What is this moment like for you

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Ian

93
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Pure

94
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Anxiety

95
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Honestly

96
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:15,744
That's because so many things can go wrong between the time the truffles come out of the ground Italy

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,536
Ian gets them in Queens

98
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
It could get

99
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Stolen they could be

100
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,119
Left on an airport tarmac

101
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,167
The airline maybe doesn't refrigerate them proper

102
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
They could even have bugs

103
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:31,359
And the troubles have already been on this amazing Journey 2 days ago these were underground in a forest in

104
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Tuscany

105
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
And they were found using.

106
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:40,063
Dogs that are trained to sniff them out I'm just removing all the ice packs from top of the box

107
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,903
Oh is that the smell smell

108
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
What do you think my God that's no it's not good

109
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,167
I love it or something it's like burnt to me it's like mushrooms combined with

110
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:00,799
Dirty socks in a good way what is dirty socks in a good way

111
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
Ian takes out a truffle

112
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
He holds it up to the light smells it

113
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,991
Sort of golden white Yukon Gold

114
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,295
This one is very nice

115
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Ian looks really really

116
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,647
Because he's banking on these truffles for his business

117
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Regalis Foods

118
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
White truffles are only in season for about 12

119
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,839
And during that time and makes most of his money for the year

120
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,191
Aeropostale truffles into a dented styrofoam cooler cover with packing tape

121
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:34,591
Load them in the trunk of his car and wear off

122
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,735
You needs to sell these $20,000 worth of truffles by 5 p.m.

123
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
Because that is when restaurants are gearing up for

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Doesn't do it

125
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
He's in trouble

126
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
Because literally every second that

127
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
The passes

128
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:52,767
The truffles are losing value or mostly water and every moment that they are out

129
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
Of the ground they are losing water they're drying up

130
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
Do it's like with every red light that we had

131
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,959
A few pennies fall out of your pocket

132
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,311
Pretty much I would say I lose about

133
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
3%

134
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
A day

135
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
If we do the math

136
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,919
I'm probably going to lose

137
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
About $1,500

138
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
Just an evaporation loss

139
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,671
Just in the trunk in the trunk do you think about that when you're sitting in traffic

140
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
I mean I've learned not to

141
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
Do red lights later we arrive at Peoria in the West Village

142
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
It's noon

143
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
We backing down a one-way Street

144
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
My back down the street

145
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,263
You're parking like in a red zone right now

146
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
I'm in a red zone

147
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
How much money do you budget per year in parking

148
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Probably $10

149
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,943
Really

150
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,783
You just park wherever you just got to park the truffles will not wait

151
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
They can't wait

152
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:55,231
Ian jumps out of the car grab the Styrofoam cooler balances scale on top of it and we rushed into the restaurant

153
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
How are you

154
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
Peoria is this really romantic

155
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
Aerie restaurant and the Chef Christopher cipollone meet the cynic

156
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Ian son rapping

157
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,783
Tukwila right now what are you thinking at this moment Chef as he unwraps what's it what's going through your mind I'm pretty excited

158
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
Wedding rings me

159
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,391
Jeffree star poking through the cooler looking through the truck

160
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
These are actually

161
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Gorgeous

162
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
We've been doing quite well with the truffles my friend

163
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,839
We're doing a simple

164
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,143
Handmade ricotta strascinati

165
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
And we

166
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
Pleasing butter and pasta water and adjust

167
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
Chiba truffle tableside

168
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
How much is the dish

169
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,823
Additional $85

170
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
Bastille

171
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Damn this boom

172
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,199
You think about it this is like pasta and butter

173
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
Which is basically

174
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
What you feed

175
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,063
A child who has a stomach flu

176
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,671
Images of some of the cheapest food you can get anywhere and checkers is 80

177
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
$5

178
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,255
Price for a plate of buttered pasta

179
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,815
Well butter pasta with truffles on top

180
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:07,935
Yeah and other is some logic to it because the idea is you want something kind of simple

181
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
All the focus is on the

182
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:14,079
Truffles you know what you don't you don't hang the Mona Lisa on a plaid wall

183
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
Red you put on a white wall to make Spotlight on it

184
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
And pasta with butter is

185
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
The Culinary equivalent of a white wall

186
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
And how many grams of truffles doing fire

187
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
5G

188
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
Is the weight

189
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Of a

190
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Nickel

191
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
That is how expense

192
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,279
For that amount Chef Chris is paying Ian about

193
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
$25

194
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,607
And he's charging his diners

195
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
About $85

196
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
What is a $60 markup

197
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
That's a powerful food

198
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Yes it is

199
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
Inch of Chris's people are

200
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Happy to pay this

201
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
Because truffles are special

202
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
You can't get them all the time or space

203
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
Don't have them and they're just excited to have this experience

204
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
Do customers come in

205
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
Especially because they want truffles

206
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
Yes definitely every year we've people kind of love to see what we are doing the Truffle assoc are and

207
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
Preparations are doing and

208
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,095
Chef Chris buys just under a half pound of truffle

209
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Which is Trust

210
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Cute ruffle that you wanted

211
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
The size of a racquetball

212
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Repeat over

213
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
Annabelle

214
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,079
That's a lot of money for truffles $967

215
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
Hilda got a couple days it's all good

216
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,431
Those few truffles will make about

217
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
40 plates of pasta

218
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Profit from those plates of pasta

219
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Will be more than two

220
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Thousand dollars

221
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,647
So this whole time we were talking a chef Chris Ian

222
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Texting

223
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Madly odd

224
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,255
Is phone glancing for the door every few minutes

225
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
Tapping his toe

226
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,559
On the floor

227
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
He hasn't sold a pound of truffles yet

228
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
Give me the four and a half hours to go into the restaurant start

229
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
Impacts of the Truffles and we're off

230
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Wow

231
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,527
And and no ticket no ticket

232
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,111
The next deal went down literally on a street corner

233
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
Steven Falls over

234
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
Private chef of a wealthy family

235
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Comes out

236
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
Play Pop the Trunk

237
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
She goes through the truffles

238
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
And then a couple minutes

239
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Another sale

240
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
How'd it go

241
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
Good

242
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
/ 4000 sold

243
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
$4,000

244
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Yeah

245
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,663
Between the private chef and Peoria and his old $5,000

246
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,503
We still has $15,000 more to sell

247
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
So we drive to the house of a

248
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Hedge fund billionaire

249
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
You jump out of the car

250
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,415
Seldom a pound of truffles

251
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Yeah I guess you know he's going to put a

252
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
Is coffee or something you need that

253
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,559
Yes by now it is 130

254
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
And the dinner rush

255
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
Starts in 3 and 1/2 hours

256
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,519
So how are we doing so far clockwise

257
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
We're a little behind

258
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Old timer whiskey and he is just

259
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
In the zone

260
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
I mean he's texting he

261
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
He's driving his

262
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
Making deals on the phone and in person

263
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
The guy just has so much

264
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Focus

265
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
He's only 24 years old which I think

266
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,879
Cesar reminded both of us.

267
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Total failures

268
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
Also bolts

269
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,047
He has been doing this a long time he came to New York when he was 8

270
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
18 years old

271
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,911
At the time he bought a minivan and he would load it up everyday

272
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
With truffles

273
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
And fresh

274
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,007
I would drive around to restaurants

275
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,639
And and beg chefs to come out to the van and and take a look at what was inside my van

276
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:35,039
I was working 16-hour days like hustling and you know I have so much stress I was losing hair and I had

277
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:40,159
I have this weird like acne-like flare-up and I was embarrassed to like go outside and I would

278
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
Make an entire

279
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,279
Dad of macaroni and cheese and basically just like watch Netflix in like

280
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
Cry myself to sleep

281
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
On weekends and it sucks

282
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Things Are

283
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,983
Much better for Ian these days in fact this year he is on track to make

284
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
6 million dollars in sales

285
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:02,175
And the whole time we're driving around with him I was just so struck by the contrast between those huge dollar figure

286
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
We keep seeing hearing

287
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,575
And just the ragtag nature of the operation itself

288
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,415
Styrofoam coolers in the back of a rental car because other car broke down

289
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Keys

290
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
24 years old

291
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
Sort of unshaven and looking somewhat sleep

292
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Deprived

293
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
It interferes with more in common

294
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,423
Mid-level weed dealer

295
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
Van

296
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
A luxury food Titan

297
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
That's what he is

298
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,895
Vici just signed a multimillion-dollar deal with William Sonoma

299
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
To sell truffle salt

300
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
And truffle oil

301
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,783
Butt and told us he's never going to stop doing this

302
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
Fresh truffle

303
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,623
It is the centerpiece of his business

304
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Italian makes most of his money

305
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,815
It's how he keeps up his relationships with the best chefs in New York relationship that he made when he started selling mushrooms out of his

306
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Minivan

307
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
In fact when his first

308
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Customers who

309
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
Used to buy things out of his minivan is where we are headed

310
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,055
That is lure fishbar and the chef is a guy named Josh capon

311
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
This is one chance at love

312
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Chill

313
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Bargain

314
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
So what was your strategy going in

315
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
And it's a situation like this

316
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Maybe start a little eye

317
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
See what he says

318
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
We're double-parked

319
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,255
Going in fingers crossed their tickets

320
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:26,911
Restaurant pack the middle of a lunch rush so wait a little while for the chef to come out

321
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,239
Inception is cooler is still texting texting texting

322
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,847
And then finally the kitchen doors open and the chef comes out

323
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
How are you funny

324
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
My name my name is Josh capon

325
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,503
We are here at the legendary lure fishbar

326
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Was my good good buddy Ian

327
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,647
He is actually in my phone as Ian truffle boy

328
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
Chef Josh starts inspecting the truck

329
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,511
Was always a pleasure to see him and

330
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,303
What exciting beautiful

331
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
And in this case

332
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
Gorgeous smelling

333
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
White truffles from

334
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,567
Demonte Tuscany Tuscany one of the truest beautiful pleasures of the World by weather on my honey

335
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,151
I stay in the castle it was stupendous

336
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,735
I'm just smelling his wife troubles I'm transported back

337
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
Could a castle with my wife where we

338
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
Drink champagne with

339
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,159
Fresh peaches off the trees and

340
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,975
Made love in the forest together

341
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
Amongst the Hogs

342
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,071
Is this the radio or TV

343
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,591
If it was for TV I think that the screen just went dark

344
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Totally

345
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,455
So Chef draft picks out a few Truffles and piles the money is little kitchen

346
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
And then they both start punching numbers and their own calculators

347
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
I say we knock this number.

348
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
1200 even

349
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:57,535
REI Fortune $1,000 even

00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,655
Ladies and gentlemen $14

00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Just came off the bill

352
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
Amazing

353
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Chef Josh

And on this special cheeseburger that he makes at the burger place

359

00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903

362
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
Quite

363
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,999
Burger

364
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559

365
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,167
We rushed back to the car and still has about $12,000 worth

366
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Truffles

00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
And it's 2:30

369
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:42,591
Our next stop is Minetta Tavern it's a well-known pretty high-end place in the West Village

370
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
The chef is Dan Silverman

371
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
He's at all

372
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
Reserved guy

373
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,503
Is this has been seeing a lot of trouble of dealers around me

374
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,599
Are there a lot of people who sell truffle or drug

375
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
Yeah there are this time of year people just get people just wandering off the street with like

376
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:03,327
Checkered cloth bundles full of truffles

377
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,167
Does just like random people always every year

378
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Probably

379
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,983
I like to buy from people that I know

380
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,799
And hit the thing there are aliens

381
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,591
All over New York City

382
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
You could be passing one of the street

383
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,199
Right now with a backpack full of 20 grand worth of truffles

384
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,295
People are from other companies but a lot of them are just hustlers

385
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
The walking from one restaurant to another

386
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,415
With a backpack full of truffles they smuggled from Europe

387
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
And you can see why they would do this

388
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
1 truffle cost

389
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
Thousand dollars

390
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,327
And you can fit a lot of truffles into a suit

391
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,959
When we get back in the car and tells us yeah there are a lot of trouble smugglers in New York right now

392
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
And they really hurt his business

393
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
They cut out the middleman they don't pay custom

394
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,359
And they cut His prophets in half

395
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
Incest used to make 20% profit

396
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Now

397
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
More like temperature

398
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:59,135
Richie restaurants like the other two and three Michelin starred restaurants are the ones that love to negotiate because

399
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:05,535
Getting so many so many different ruffle people in the door trying to sell the product but they have

400
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,327
Choice of who they buy from

401
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
At this point

402
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
3:30 and Ian going to leave

403
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
He's got 90 minutes left to unload like

404
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,775
$10,000 worth of Ruffles and let's face it Stacy

405
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
We were slowing him down

406
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,639
So and drop this off in SoHo and at this point we are both

407
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,175
Starving and

408
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
We both smell like

409
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Dirty socks

410
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:30,879
In a good way they see your word for it

411
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
The dollar exchange

412
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
And I still have never

413
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
Tried when I've no idea

414
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,863
Because we're consummate journalist we had to Burger & Barrel to try Chef Josh capons

415
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
$68 drop off

416
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,495
Is the third week that we've been getting in white truffles and an honor that

417
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,799
We're doing our famous white truffle Burger

418
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
I highly recommend

419
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
I

420
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
Would like to order that

421
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
Are British arrived and they are

422
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Beautiful

423
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
The truffles are sliced thin and

424
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
Fanned out

425
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,855
Over the top of the burgers you can see them

426
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
5 grams

427
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
Apparently worth of truffles

428
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
Cigar bites

429
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,511
Okay this is it this is a big moment

430
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,911
Nonon I know how to describe it it's like shoes that tastes like shoes smoke cashews

431
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,983
I told you dirty dirty socks in a good way

432
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:24,383
Yeah see around

433
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
She's like dirty socks in a good way

434
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:32,063
The best description I'm sorry I doubted you

435
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
I'm in

436
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
She say she want to tell you

437
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
Dirty socks in a good way

438
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,791
Dirty socks in a good way we actually call us and food scientists figure out what the

439
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
Dirty sock thing was

440
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,375
What is it about this flavor

441
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,655
The captive these people so much

442
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
Change DNS life

443
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
And it turns out that

444
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,567
Truffle smell and taste comes from this molecule called androstenol

445
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,383
And you just found in sweat

446
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
And urine

447
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,015
Yep farmers will spray female pigs Lindros known to get them in the mood

448
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
Which is

449
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:08,671
Hot and you know I'm not get it I know why humans are obsessed

450
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
What truffle is because

451
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
Picanha

452
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
Smell like us

453
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
You're eating

454
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
Humanity

455
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,399
The thing that we most want from the finest

456
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
Fanciest restaurants in the world

457
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Is sweat

458
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
Sex and urine

459
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
That is why we look trouble so much

460
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,103
You think it'd be easier to reply

461
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:27,871
OK Google

462
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431
A cheaper

463
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,783
Totally but I just think this is also something about this high-low combination

464
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
Which way do restaurants get

465
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
The food is like what one of their finest

466
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,439
Most desired ingredients in there getting it in this order sketchy

467
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
Back alley kind of way

468
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,815
White people wandering in off the street with napkins full of truffles or

469
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
Styrofoam

470
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Google Earth

471
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,703
Speaking of which we check back in with Ian to see how the rest of his day

472
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:58,079
A little bit longer because we were his good luck charm after he left us

473
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
His car got towed

474
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,199
With $5,000 worth of truffles in the trunk

475
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,783
Was that your car getting towed with $5,000 worth of cash in the

476
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,831
Cash that is disintegrating

477
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,623
It's right but This Is Where I Leave You

478
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
Calls and texting to been doing all day paid off because he'd actually been taking orders from chefs all over the country for any left

479
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
Leftover truffles he might have

480
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,119
So as soon as he got his car at the impound lot

481
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,191
He spent the FedEx office at JFK Airport

482
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
And Indians world this is a buzzard

483
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,543
Because we're in the parking lot

484
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,591
He packed up the truffles

485
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,639
And got them sent out just before the

486
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,663
The final FedEx

487
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,431
Deadline

488
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
Which means

489
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
If you recently ate truffles in

490
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
Chicago Ord

491
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Relay

492
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Cisco

493
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
It's quite possible they were packed up

494
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
In the trunk

495
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
Car

496
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:50,047

499
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,287

500
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,615
Iconic food in New Jersey for people that have been fighting about it

501
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
450 years

502
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
Self to find out why

503
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:13,087
And if you want some light reading and actually has a book coming out it is called truffle Boy comes out in February
