1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,792
Hate just a quick note

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,608
Today Show originally aired in 2015

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,192
Francis Galton was the kind of person who believes in

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,496
You know people who had studied thing

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,520
People who knew stuff

6
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:15,104
He figured they knew things that Ordinary People just did not

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
I mean of course they do

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,920
Obviously

9
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,480
Allende Dalton goes to a country

10
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,528
It's about a hundred years ago in English

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,576
And there's this contest going on it

12
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,624
Guess the weight of the ox

13
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,464
Go to the scientist and a statistician any figures

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey I can do an experiment

15
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,816
Rights to figures I'm going to take everyone's guess

16
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,840
Take the average

17
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,912
And compare that to the actual weight of the ox

18
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,752
We heard the story from James sawicki he's an economics Journal

19
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,568
So he thought we were going to end up with was

20
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,104
A really flawed yes

21
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,664
Because in his mind what you were doing was

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,224
You were taking guesses of a few smart people

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,272
A few mediocre people in a lot of moron

24
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,576
Stop

25
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Shelf

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,672
He figured that the groups gas was going to be way way off the

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,024
The contest organizers gave Carlton the little slips of paper with everyone guesses

28
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,584
He took them calculate the average

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,144
The average was 1197

30
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
And the ox

31
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,984
The ox weight 1198

32
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,080
So that in other words the crowds judgment was essentially

33
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Perfect

34
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,872
1 pound off

35
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
1 pounder

36
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
This is

37
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
Super

38
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
Creepy

39
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,552
What's going on if there's some kind of like

40
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
Collective unconscious

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,136
Magic like a Ouija board

42
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:37,792
Nothing right but the idea that underlies this it is everywhere it's the idea of the stock market thousands of random people buy

43
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,608
Buying and selling shares like when you hear that Apple stock

44
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
Or the Dow Plunge

45
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,472
That's basically people guessing the weight of an oz

46
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:50,080
Yes everywhere right it's it's the price of oil it's the price of Orange

47
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,408
All kinds of things that are really important to the world working

48
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
Exactly this way

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,248
But why should it work why should a bunch of random people

50
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,856
People a lot of them have no idea what they're doing somehow magically producing

51
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
Answer that makes sense

52
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928
Does it really work

53
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:10,816
Why doesn't hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm taking cold

54
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:17,216
And I'm David kestenbaum today on the show mister Dalton we redo your experiment

55
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
Penelope

56
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
Hi Penelope thanks for letting us Wii U

57
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,456
She's chewing one.

58
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,880

64
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,896
So we came up with a plan to repeat buttons

65
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,504
Find a fair and a cow and a big scale to weigh the cow

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
And then

67
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,904
And then we were going to throw the question out to the crowd ask the world how much does this cow weigh

68
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
We don't want to just limited to people

69
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,512
Fair so we figured we'd take some pictures post them online

70
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
Ask the whole world to guess

71
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:19,168
So we went out to a County Fair in Burlington County New Jersey

72
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,520
How we met Penelope the cow in the dairy tent she was sitting on a bunch of hay

73
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
Christian Christmas with taken care of

74
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
Can you just describe what she looks like

75
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,944
Yeah she's mostly black she has white legs

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
She has a white spot in the middle of her head but

77
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
Big black cow

78
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
What did you say

79
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,720
I said holy cow without even realizing what I think she's much bigger she just stood up she's walking out of the bar now

80
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
She's way bigger than I thought when she was

81
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Sitting down

82
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,656
We took some pictures of you Jacob standing next to the cow for scale

83
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,984
And just finally decide to ask people to Fair Hemet

84
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,568
As it happened to his kids if they're like kids

85
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
Power Penelope

86
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
Which was fine you know

87
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
What's your name

88
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
Caleb

89
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
How much do you think Mel B weighs

90
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
6 lb

91
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
Had to come up with that number

92
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
Because I'm 6 years old

93
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
You guys want to get sandwich with Cowboys

94
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,047
1600 lb

95
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
But 6000

96
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
Do you know how much you weigh

97
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
Not at all

98
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,799
I'm sympathetic looking up in lb I had no idea how much you weigh

99
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
Like I didn't even know how to think about

100
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
Did you weigh more than my car

101
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,687
Scituate last in my car

102
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
I don't even know how much my car worth

103
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
More than a cat

104
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
We've had an older group of

105
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,695
And yet they also guessed on the low side but they had this bigger

106
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
This is really more worrying

107
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
It was a problem that adults also seem to

108
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,815
And it was this

109
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,351
The first kid said in them

110
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
All the other kids said

111
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,727
Basically the same number numbers that were like

112
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
Too close to the fire

113
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,079
Like they're incapable of guessing anything

114
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
Financista

115
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
Anissa how old are you

116
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
Alarm 10

117
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
How much do you think a cow weighs

118
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
200 lb

119
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,135
My name is Gabriela I'm 10 and I think the cow weighs

120
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
300 lb

121
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,511
My name is Caleb and I'm 7 years old and I think

122
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,535
The Cowboys

123
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
300

124
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Okay

125
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,423
People are not that different from cows

126
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
We heard

127
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,751
If we don't know something we look for a leader

128
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
Even if the leader maybe doesn't

129
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
Canobie finish

130
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Chewing

131
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
And we took her over to be weighed

132
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:42,783
It's actually pretty unusual to want a way to cow and the scale they had at the fair was not

133
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
What kind of scale is this

134
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
Text like a truck scales wanted

135
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
4

136
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Same sauce

137
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
Scala used for big trucks

138
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,047
Which we use it the way the tractors on the track

139
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,607
It'll work it'll work for a cow

140
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
Testing you were

141
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
Obsessed

142
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:04,799
Paranoid paranoid about keeping the result of the secret you didn't want it to leak out I guess

143
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
Get all these people are gathered

144
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,199
3 Clear Lake Clear everybody out except for just a minimum of people

145
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,039
Like everything else over there

146
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
Kirsten walk Penelope up onto the scale

147
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
Play watch this little digital display

148
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
It's

149
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
1300

150
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
And 55 lb

151
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,983
1355

152
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
We walked now he back to the dairy tent

153
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
And then we were

154
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,175
The next day we posted photos online of the cow when you may be right

155
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:47,039
I was there to give some sense of perspective we put you on the tractor scale 165

156
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
That are Kelly Clarkson Bowie here put it all up

157
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
Guess the weight of this cow

158
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
And the idea was our Hope was

159
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
Fat lots and lots of

160
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
People would go

161
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Because

162
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:05,471
Fundamental question here the thing we're trying to figure out is if you have a bunch of random people making their best

163
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
Guess it's something

164
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Do you get close to

165
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
Get out the truth do you get close to the right answer

166
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
So we put it up

167
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
And we waited for the results to

168
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
Alright been up for how long now

169
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
2 minutes

170
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,551
How many entries

171
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
15 + 3

172
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
Reload reload

173
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
Pill 15

174
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
Still 15

175
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,511
Come on

176
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Oh my God

177
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
That's all we're going to get 15

178
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
The retreat

179
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,495
You were here. I've been buried after 2

180
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,615
We also showed the pictures of me and and the cow to James her Wiki

181
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,431
He's the New Yorker writer we talked with the beginning of the show

182
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
Yes we wrote a book called The Wisdom of crowds

183
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
But we have to

184
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,367
Remember hear the actual weight of the cow 1355 lb

185
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
All right I will guess

186
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,695
Calloways

187
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
700 in

188
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
25

189
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
How did you

190
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Come up with that number

191
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,471
I don't know maybe he looks like four or five times

192
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,287
Jacob size I guess

193
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,567
Usher cowser

194
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
Are they denser or not

195
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Cell

196
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
You know whatever

197
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Pretty random actually

198
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015
Pretty random in pretty Raw

199
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
We told them Penelope's actual weight

200
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
Twice as heavy as his

201
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,743
It's a sad commentary that someone who's been talkin about an ox

202
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,815
This long has absolutely no clue how much a cow weigh

203
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
We get a crowd of people like you

204
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:44,031
Could be terrible. Be in bad shape I'm praying somebody was guessing to 2200 on the other end

205
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,103
Because the key question is what's the average going to be

206
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
Right is the crowd going to

207
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,943
Charlie's how close are they going to get

208
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,503
So we let this up online for 5.

209
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
Let people guess for 5 days

210
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,599
Our colleague Bowie tallied it all up

211
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
David you and I came into the studio we didn't know the result

212
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
And we came in today

213
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
Give us the numbers

214
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
First of all

215
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
How many people get

216
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
So the number people that guest

217
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,911
17205 peep

218
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,495
17000 that's what you get that's good

219
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
That's good it's as if you got like a small town at 2 all guess we took those guesses out of them up and couch

220
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Calculator the app

221
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
This was the big moment

222
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Is ready

223
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
1287 lb

224
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,623
1287

225
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,719
Now we actually weighed 1355

226
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:39,583
Pretty close right so that's two within like what 60 lb

227
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
That was pretty impressive

228
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
Yep and they're only like 5% off you know okay sure the golden thing was one pound off this isn't that

229
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,455
A bunch of random people looking at this little cow picture in their Facebook feed on their iPhone

230
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
And here's another amazing

231
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,063
When we ask people to guess we also asking this other question

232
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
We asked are you in XP

233
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
Have you ever worked with

234
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
Cuz remember gotten fat

235
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Express might be bad

236
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,023
3000 some people answered yes to that

237
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,167
That question Jacob you wondered where they really really extra sure these are just people clicking a button on mine so we emailed

238
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,007
And we heard back and they did seem pretty

239
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
You know a lot of them

240
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
We're farmers

241
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,383
One of them mentioned the quote absence of a visible

242
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
Actually few of them

243
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,271
And apparently that tells you something about how old the cow is how much it weighs

244
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
So how did the experts do

245
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Hear the answer

246
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,391
So the average gas for the experts

247
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
Was

248
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,743
1272 lb

249
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
They're worse

250
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,095
They were worse it's amazing

251
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
So it's okay so maybe that is wisdom of the

252
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
To be fair the experts were only marginally worse

253
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,519
But they did not beat the crowd

254
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:56,127
We talked to Ricky about these results and he wasn't surprised infected rights in his book

255
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
Chasing the expert is a mistake

256
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
We should ask the crap

257
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:02,527
And the fact that the larger crowd got it within 5

258
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
Percent he said that seems about right to him

259
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,695
When people do versions of this experiment asking people to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar for

260
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,791
The crowd usually gets it within 3 to 5%

261
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
You know what I think is interesting about this is

262
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
Even though I've written a book

263
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
Done this experiment number of times

264
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,727
Every time I do it

265
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
And everytime I hear the results

266
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
I'm like

267
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
It's not going to work

268
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
The idea is so counter-intuitive you know it's it's pretty extraordinary in that regard

269
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
The power of this

270
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
To actually

271
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
Let the group arrive at

272
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
Really good decisions

273
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
It series

274
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
It is he right it is

275
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
There's something magical about

276
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Attitude seems Magic

277
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,839
It's not magic it's just math but it seems Magic

278
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
So what he says

279
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
The reason the seems to

280
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,775
Is that every person's gas is contributing some new little piece of

281
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,615
Everybody is different everybody thinks slightly

282
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
When they're trying to get the cows

283
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
Maybe one person study that photo of the cow from the side

284
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
Some people are probably trying to figure out

285
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
How many Jacobs would fit in

286
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,415
How someone else might know how much a horse weighs and kind of go from there

287
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
Like every person's guess in some ways reflects

288
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
Their specific life experience

289
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,631
Judging the size of things in the world just from Decades of living

290
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,727
But every person's mind is a different scale for weighing the cow

291
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
Any one of those scales

292
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
Isn't going to be a great

293
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
Scale write each one of those is probably going to be wrong there's going to be some error in every single want the good in some way but they

294
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
I also have some

295
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Problem with a

296
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Yeah

297
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,295
One of the essential things is

298
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
Those problems

299
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,439
Tend to cancel each other out right maybe one person is wrong 200 lbs High

300
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,255
But the next guy is wrong 200 lb low

301
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,631
So that the wrong Parts the wrong is kind of washes out and in the end what you're left with

302
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
Is all those little bits of information

303
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,567
And the result is amazingly good you know collectively we do seem to know what we're doing

304
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,639
Circus has there certainly times when this does not

305
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Work like think

306
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
Stock market panic

307
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Score bubbles

308
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,783
A big problem is that thing we saw with the kids

309
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
At the beginning

310
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,111
Where one person says a number

311
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,743
And then everybody else around them just kind of latches onto that number there's actually a technical term for this

312
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,791
Information Cascade

313
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,887
Like my neighbor just bought a house that seems like a lot of money pay for house but he did fine

314
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,703
I can do the same thing or everyone's buying that stuff

315
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,495
Must be a good stock to buy

316
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
The stock market is not perfect

317
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
But

318
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,663
What is amazing about the stock market is that investors individually

319
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
Even very good investors

320
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,527
Are often times irrational that

321
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
I have tiny bits of him

322
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Information they're making

323
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,879
Decisions based on emotion or on

324
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
You know some tip they got

325
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
And yet collectively

326
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,023
We trust them to set the value of

327
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,559
All of these companies

328
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
When you think about it

329
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
But

330
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,215
The interesting thing is I don't think there's a better way to do

331
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
Is not a more effective

332
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,847
This is why it is so hard to be

333
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
The wisdom of the crowd

334
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Pretty good

335
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
And the people seem to be that way I can be the stop

336
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Often they're just

337
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:21,183
In our experiment for example there were 15 people who got the cows wait exactly right

338
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
They were off by 0%

339
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
We picked one of them at random is our way

340
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
We call them up

341
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
To tell me the news

342
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
And to see how he did it

343
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Hello

344
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Thesaurus

345
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:37,055
Yeah how's it going

346
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
In college

347
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
Never touched a cow in his

348
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:42,175
That could not even remember his gas

349
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,271
We told him he'd guest 1355 lb

350
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,087
And if the weight of the cow was also

351
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
Oh my God

352
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
You won

353
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
That's amazing

354
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
You want to know how I got that guy

355
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Yes

356
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,423
Hi Google hi Google average weight of female calendar said

357
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
Yeah I got it

358
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
Toe pops up and

359
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
A little

360
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Fox and

Dot-com

366

Dairy movies.com says average weight of a cow's 1500 lb depending on the age and whatever

Within 8% of Penelope's actual weight
