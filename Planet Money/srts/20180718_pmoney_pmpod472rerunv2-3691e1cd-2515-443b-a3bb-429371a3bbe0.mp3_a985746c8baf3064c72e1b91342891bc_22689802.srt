00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,096
Everyone Robert Smith here a couple weeks ago I got an email from a listener named Mark

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:04,864
Hummer gang

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,728
Mark listen to this episode right here when it aired back in 2013

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,800
And you heard a reporter's makeup promise at the very end of the epi

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,360
They said that they would follow up in 5 years

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:21,504
And so I went down to my calendar and I set an appointment for July 1at 2018

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,552
Are we actually forgot about it

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,696
But July 1st rolls around and marks ends with an image of his Google Calendar and there's a big red circle around a note

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
It says

10
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,256
Planet Money to follow up

11
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,048
I'm show number 472

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,840
Wild hold you guys accountable

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,496
Everybody we keep our promises for today we bring you an update on the brilliant one page plan to fix

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,520
Global warming

15
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,800
This one's for you mark

16
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,872
I've been covering climate change on and off for about

17
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
14 years

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,968
And it's one of those stories were frankly as a journalist

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,272
You get kind of burned out because

20
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,344
It's essentially the same story over and over again

21
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,648
Scientist saying hey this is real

22
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,672
Could be bad

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,744
Sea level rise giant storms extinctions

24
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,840
Then of course you hear politicians and world leaders and yes we must do something

25
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
And then

26
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
And then not a lot happens

27
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
As a sign of how gridlock we are in this country President Obama the other week laid out his plans to try to reduce carbon emission

28
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
Sentir in the United

29
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,176
He's having to rely on a 43 year old law that was

30
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,224
Originally intended to deal with smog

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
It had nothing to do with carbon dioxide

32
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,064
Guesstimate a kind of joke about it

33
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,136
43 years ago Congress passed a law called

34
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
The Clean Air Act

35
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Of $0.19

36
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,256
Matlock passed the Senate unanimously

37
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Think about that

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,632
Unanimously it passed the House of Representatives

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
375

40
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
I don't know who the one guy was

41
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
I haven't looked at a

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,872
Where you can barely get that many votes to name a Post Office business

43
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,224
You certainly can't get that many votes for a full-on climate bill in,

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Chris right now

45
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
Type of thing to me is what makes

46
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
Climate change seems so hopeless

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,696
The promise so dire and get the world is finding it so impossible to act

48
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,792
And I've always imagined it's because the solutions are just incredibly complicated

49
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Inexpensive

50
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
At the standard

51
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,424
Short-term pain versus long-term gain dining

52
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,008
It turns out they're fixing climate change does not have to be either of the

53
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
There is a very simple solution

54
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,104
That could cost us

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Almost

56
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Nothing

57
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,760

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,624
What are the guys has been dreaming about this simple way to deal with climate change

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,696
His name is Henry Jacoby he's an economist at MIT

70
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,256
Center for Energy and environmental policy research

71
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,840
And he told me really if you want to address climate change

72
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
There is just one thing you need to do

73
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,240
If you left the economist write the legislation it could be really simple

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
If you were to write it how short could it be

75
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
So if I if I were to write it

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Page

77
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,944
What you Kobe would write on that page is

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
A carbon tax

79
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,088
Basically he says you tax the fossil fuels in proportion to the amount of carbon they released

80
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,416
That would make coal oil and natural gas more expensive

81
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
And then

82
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
Actually that's all you have to do

83
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,376
Do understand how this would work I took a drive with jacobi's colleague John Riley

84
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:54,240
Obviously gasoline is a fossil fuel so under a carbon tax it gets more expensive

85
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
And driving gets more expensive

86
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
What kind of car is this

87
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,616
It's an Infiniti

88
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
With my kids all gone I actually decided to do something luxury this that's good something like 27 miles per gallon on the highway

89
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,320
The worst thing around

90
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,464
But it's not a it's not a Prius we pull into a gas station

91
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
In the first year of a carbon tax

92
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,071
He imagines the price of gasoline would rise by about

93
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
$0.25 a gallon

94
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,751
Over a year he figured this would cost him an extra

95
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
$125

96
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
But then it would get more expensive

97
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,455
So the way most people imagine a carbon tax working is that you wrap it up over time

98
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
Tighten the screws

99
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
Gradually push the economy away from

100
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Fossil fuels

101
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
By 2050

102
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,671
Riley figures the carbon tax would go from $0.25 a gallon

103
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
About a dollar

104
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
Barry Allen

105
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:51,583
Predator the math to figure out how much that would cost him driving his Infiniti extra per year

106
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,215
Then that would be about $500 a year I might buy more fuel efficient vehicle

107
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
And right there. If that is the carbon tax

108
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Working at the

109
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,663
It is that people and businesses all over the economy they would start thinking

110
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,527
Making changes course correction some big some small to avoid the higher cost

111
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
Here's Henry Jacoby again

112
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
You can decide

113
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
Do you want to harass your children to turn off the lights

114
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
Do you want to buy a smaller car

115
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,047
Do you want to drive the bus one day a week

116
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
Do you want to insulate your attic

117
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
1000 things that people think of to lower

118
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
The cost of of this activity this cut

119
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
Got the tax on it

120
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,431
The tax has a has small effects around us around a million different activities and that's the advantage of it gets

121
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
Its influence almost

122
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Everywhere

123
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,807
And this is why Economist generally love

124
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
A carbon tax those tiny effects

125
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,903
Over millions and millions of people and activities

126
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Can have

127
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,695
A huge impact

128
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,791
When change to the tax code in the entire economy all of us living in the world

129
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
We shift our Behavior

130
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
Reduce carbon emission

131
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
So do, this is super obvious of fossil fuels

132
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:05,055
Costs associated with them that aren't reflected in their price right now so you just need to correct that price

133
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
Make it more expensive

134
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,175
Although that does raise an obvious question here how much

135
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
More expensive

136
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,087
Figure out how much more expensive we're going to Imagine John Riley life under a carbon

137
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,695
We're going to try to figure out how much extra everything would cost him and add it up

138
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Do we need gasoline already

139
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,583
In the first year of a carbon tax he estimates gasoline would cost him a total of about

140
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,887
125 bucks more a year

141
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,239
So I'm going to keep track your genres are proxy for what life would be like under a carbon tax

142
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
We're at a hundred and twenty five bucks a year so far

143
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
And then the next thing probably is electricity

144
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,943
Yeah so here's my electric bill

145
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,295
My electric bill last month was $46.27

146
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,367
Generali figures that would go up but not by that much

147
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
About $60 each

148
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
All right so adding that

149
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
$185 a year so far extra that were spending

150
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
What else is there

151
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
There's heating witch in New England heating can be pretty expensive

152
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,471
You know I think I did some calculations

153
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,287
I'm near the average household in

154
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,919
New England would spend about $1,000 on natural gas for heating your home

155
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223
The carbon tax would add

156
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
About $100 today

157
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,087
Write another hundred rat 285 right now

158
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Anything else

159
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:28,511
And I kept trying to find Big Ticket items I like airplane flies he said that's probably $75 a year

160
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
$360 extra a year

161
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,191
It turned out one of the most carbon-intensive activities is something

162
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
I had not even thought of

163
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,775
It's something it's right underneath our feet

164
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Concrete

165
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,151
And to get to the bottom of this one John and I call if a guy on speakerphone who works

166
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
In the concrete business

167
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
My name is David Perkins and I'm with

168
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,039
TXI based out of Dallas Texas

169
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
And we

170
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,647
Manufacture cement aggregate in concrete building materials

171
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,695
It's fantastic to talk to you David

172
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Likewise

173
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:03,583
David Perkins explains that concrete is basically cement with some gravel and sand added

174
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,887
And the process of making cement

175
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
Produces a lot of carbon dioxide

176
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
Making 1 ton of cement he says

177
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,567
Makes about eight tenths of a ton of

178
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
CO2

179
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,223
They're two reasons for this one is that there's a lot of chemistry involve do you have to heat the ingredients up to very high temperature

180
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
That often means using fossil

181
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Desecrated

182
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
But then there's also the the process itself

183
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:33,535
Turned out to produce carbon dioxide on its own me the chemical reactions by which the cement is formed that produces carbon

184
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
Approximately 50

185
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
2%

186
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
Of those two missions at the CO2 that is

187
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
Generated from the manufacturer of at 7

188
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
That is is directly related to what we call process

189
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,591
And that's that chemical step it has to

190
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,359
Steak place

191
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,151
But that's largely unavoidable

192
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
That's correct

193
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,039
We do the math and it looks like concrete under the first year of a carbon tax

194
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
The price of concrete would go up by

195
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
25%

196
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
You be looking at a pretty significant impact abs

197
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
This is one of those Industries where

198
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
It's hard to imagine a way to adjust

199
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Make the thing make concrete

200
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
Without producing any carbon dioxide

201
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,447
And David Perkins says concrete is everywhere

202
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
One of those kind of things that

203
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,287
Likely standing on

204
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,103
Or in a building that has

205
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
Cement indoor Concrete in it

206
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,711
It if it's really kind of a

207
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,527
Have a silencer thing that you don't really realize

208
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,343
Can you see cement or concrete from where you are right now

209
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,647
As matter fact I am sitting on some

210
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
So concrete a lot of

211
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,071
Carbon emissions associated with it but it's actually hard to account for in my Tally here right to

212
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
John Riley

213
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,935
He's not going to the hardware store with a girly and buying bags of concrete

214
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Evite

215
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:51,871
Byram concrete at all he walks on concrete he may work in the concrete building but those things are no longer in meeting

216
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
The carbon they were limited to carbon when they were created but

217
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
How do we do this

218
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,319
I guess that's a Mighty Ducks build a new building

219
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
It works or

220
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
You know

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,767
And carpet is more expensive that means maybe less salary for John or something or if the city needs to raise taxes

222
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,119
Tag cover the cost of putting in new sidewalks you know that could impact him but

223
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
John Riley doesn't actually buy in a concrete

224
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
Do you think simple for our purposes with him is our products

225
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
You can add 0

226
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,359
Can you add zero all right

227
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
So

228
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,455
Is there anything else before you go on there's one other thing I asked

229
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
If you think about the stuff that we spend money on everyday

230
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
There's one big ticket thing was left out which is

231
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
Futon

232
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
What's a big budget item

233
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,511
So we went to the supermarket and I tried to find things that have been shipped from

234
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,535
Far away

235
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Picking up

236
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,887
Fruits and vegetables and looking at the label and asking

237
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
John how much more expensive they would be

238
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Would it be a big deal

239
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
Oranges oranges come from Florida

240
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
Not a big deal

241
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,591
Mangoes mangoes from Peru

242
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Again not a big deal

243
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,199
Kiwi where are kiwis from

244
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,575
Originally from New Zealand so that would be about the fire far as you can

245
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
What's the distance from New Zealand

246
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
Not a big deal

247
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,743
The transportation part is not a big part of the cost

248
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,559
We look at the transportation think that's the big deal

249
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,631
Transportation to help you put things on boats

250
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,959
It's really pretty efficient in terms of fuel use

251
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
3 buy a bunch of stuff

252
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
Got to the car and then we look through the bill

253
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,407
So our grocery shopping $13.12 looks like

254
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
And the total carbon tax would be

255
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
About $0.17

256
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
So the headline thing carbon tax review

257
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
17

258
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
Yes

259
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,439
If we trace it all the way through because food would cost them maybe

260
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,255
Fifty bucks extra a year in the first year of a car

261
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Alright so

262
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:52,447
That's it right that everything's alright to our grand total then calculate this up for the additional cost to John Riley

263
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,007
Are proxy under the first year of a carbon tax

264
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
$410

265
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Puryear that's how much

266
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
What do we think about

267
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
Well first of all for a lot of families

268
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
That could be pretty paint

269
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
It's all right if you're in the lower income bracket

270
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
You're counting every dollar you're definitely going to feel

271
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:12,671
And for some people obviously it will be way more than 410

272
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
If you have a very long commute you spend a lot of fossil fuels you have

273
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
Why you left your job

274
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,119
If you're a coal miner you're probably going to be hit especially hard

275
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,935
And remember this is also just for the first year of a carpenter

276
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Tax rate that is the tax

277
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,287
Is going to go off of it every year to force people to change with

278
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
I do have to say

279
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,431
I thought I would be more this is basically

280
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
A dollar a day

281
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,367
And you may have heard that phrase in Pella. I feel like if you going to pay that for public radio it seems a bargain for saving the world

282
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
Play the beginning of the podcast we said for

283
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:51,071
Free whatever you think about it is not free

284
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
That's because we're not done yet

285
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
There is one more part to this

286
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,775
Which is about what you do with all that money you raised from a carpet

287
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,847
If the tax rates of the government collecting money everyone

288
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
$110 or whatever on average

289
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
And what you do Under the Sea

290
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,759
And if you would take that money you brought in

291
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
And you give it right back to the

292
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
White soda

293
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
Just to be clear collect all this money from people you divide it up by the population

294
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
And then you write everyone a check

295
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
That's that's a boy to think about

296
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Usher

297
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,959
How does it help it feel like a defeat the purpose you take 410 bucks from John Reilly

298
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
And then you

299
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:35,103
Better check for 410 bucks that's on average right I mean I know it's weird

300
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
It seems like magic

301
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,943
But I mean imagine right in this scenario

302
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Gas and

303
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
Heating your house all that stuff

304
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
It is still more expensive even if you get the check

305
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
Great so there's still this incentive tonight

306
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
Use fossil fuel

307
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,487
You can think about it from Individual people

308
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
Perspectives right if you live in a city

309
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,631
And you get the check you might actually making money cuz the check will be more than you're paying and carbon tax

310
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,423
If you live in a rural area

311
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,495
And you have a large carbon footprint the check isn't going to offset it all but

312
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,335
In either case you're still going to hate paying rent tax and you're going to try and

313
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,359
Change your habits

314
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
Change what you doing

315
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Maybe people moved

316
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
They still make

317
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
The more money you save

318
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
I'll be doing something differently

319
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,343
That's extra money in your pocket cuz you're not paying the tax

320
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,647
And then you still get a check at the end of the year

321
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Does he like me

322
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
You can't work

323
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Well

324
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
Trust me

325
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Should

326
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
This is actually pretty basic economic

327
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,471
And there's a way to take this magic trick and make it even more Magic

328
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,311
You give the money back in a smarter way you don't write everyone to check

329
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,103
You just cut their income

330
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Right so you give the money back by

331
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,943
Lessening their income

332
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
They get to keep more of their salary

333
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Exactly

334
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
In polls most Economist love the carbon tax

335
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
The same Economist tend to dislike

336
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
The income tax

337
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,951
That's because when you tax something

338
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
You discourage it

339
00:14:55,487 --> 00:15:00,351
Income is something we probably don't want to discourage we want to encourage people to

340
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,191
Be able to keep more of the money that they are in the job we want to encourage businesses

341
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,263
To hire people and income tax discourages.

342
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:12,895
Deborah, this is a chance to reduce a bad tax the income tax and replace it with

343
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
A good tax

344
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
A tax on carbon

345
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
It's like a kind of pollution

346
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,039
In fact if you do this John Riley

347
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
A carbon tax

348
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Can be nearly painless

349
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
For the economy as a whole

350
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
That's right as promised

351
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
You can fight climate change

352
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
And do it

353
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
Basically

354
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
This is almost Magic

355
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Because

356
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
In some of the work we've done

357
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
The whole economy actually benefits by that tacswap

358
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,799
You raise the carbon tax at does increase your energy cost

359
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,127
But you actually improve economic performance by reducing the other tax

360
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
And the economy is actually better off

361
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
Can it really be true

362
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
Yes

363
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,087
As I called around I talked to a bunch of Economist about the

364
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,391
The basic idea is totally sound

365
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
And if you give the money back by

366
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
Cutting taxes

367
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,303
Some people were skeptical the economy would actually grow faster if you do that but

368
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
But they said you could definitely offset a lot of the

369
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
Me to be clear right certain industries

370
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
Coal mining for instance would take a hit

371
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,519
Some people will pay more than others under the sea

372
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
System but

373
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,335
When you look at the economy of the whole

374
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
It doesn't miss a step

375
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
Just keeps on growing

376
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
And of course there is one other benefit the thing we're trying to fix in the first place

377
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
Climate change we're finally addressing

378
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
And it's all because of

379
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:31,999
Carbon tax write it encourages people to conserve energy and also this is something effect that that I love about it that we haven't touched on

380
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
When you make

381
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
Carbon more expensive

382
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Other

383
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:41,727
More environmentally friendly energy sources become less expensive by comparison to for example right now

384
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
Coal is cheaper than solar

385
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
But presumably under carbon tax eventually

386
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Kobe more expensive

387
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,151
Solar energy solar becomes

388
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
The financial irrational

389
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Choice

390
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
And that's how you end up

391
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Switching the entire life

392
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,599
Andrew Jacoby told me that

393
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,159
If you could Implement a global carbon

394
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
Tax all over the world

395
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,023
He says you could limit global warming to 2 degrees by the end of the century

396
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,327
Instead of where we're headed now which

397
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
It could be more like 5 degree

398
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,239
The kind of standard line that you have in the international discussions that were trying to limit that the increase the tutor

399
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
That's something that would be

400
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,847
Avoid the sort of the really bad.

401
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
If you hit the five degrees we're talkin about a world that we don't really understand

402
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
It's it it is deadly serious business

403
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,111
If we could hold it to 2 degrees which won't be easy if we could hold it to degree

404
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
I think that

405
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,487
Probably would survive a lot better but five five degrees

406
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
Effects on

407
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
On ecosystems and agriculture on Selah rise

408
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
Such ass is something that

409
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
That we just barely under

410
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
So let me get this straight

411
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:50,591
Beer connoisseur saying that perhaps the biggest environmental crisis that Humanity has ever faced

412
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
One that has

413
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,919
What policy-makers for decades

414
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
Is utterly solvable and won't cost us

415
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
Barely a penny

416
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,111
Basically yes I mean are there winners and losers right

417
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,415
A carbon tax in the US you shift a lot of money around

418
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Some people bother

419
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,511
And and if you look out really long termite

420
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,583
Like to the end of the century they say there is some slight drag on the USA

421
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,399
It's pretty small I mean instead of

422
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,239
Our economy being say 8.6 times larger than it is now

423
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
It would be eight points

424
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
4 * log

425
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,127
And you know what we're talking about here at this is just for the United States

426
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
You know one of the biggest

427
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
Challenges with implementing something like

428
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
My guess is that

429
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,783
You need to do a global you need to do it in all

430
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,599
And its carbon tax would be more costly for a

431
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695
They're still constructing all their buildings and Roads

432
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,511
They're using much more cement and concrete

433
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
Much more energy

434
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,095
And this coordination problem

435
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
Is of course one of the main reasons that this simple slow

436
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Actually so

437
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
Simple to implement

438
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
You got to commit the rest of the world's come along with

439
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
You can still argue

440
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,431
It is basically free for us and you have to do it why don't you just go ahead

441
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:02,527
When I was in Boston I talk to Gilbert Metcalf he

442
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
Come back from

443
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
Ascent at the treasury Department needs an economist

444
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
At Tufts

445
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
And I asked him

446
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,279
You know what is there a special binder in the treasury Department on the Shelf somewhere in the office that says

447
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Secret carbon tax

448
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,423
And he said no you know that Congress has debated a cap-and-trade plan which

449
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,727
Implemented isn't that different

450
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
Carbon tax

451
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,311
You know it's not something it's on the table right

452
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,175
And I said would you think a carbon tax or something like it really has any chance

453
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
And he said eventually he thinks

454
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,759
Yes it does

455
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,855
Kind of like what Churchill said about the Americans around World War II that

456
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
The Americans will always do the right thing after

457
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
You're trying everything else first

458
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,255
And I kind of think that's where we are around climate

459
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,887
We're going to try lots of foolish and silly ideas and wasteful ideas will try to ignore the problem for a while

460
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,447
But at some point we're going to recognize the problems there

461
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
And to a carbon tax we can raise some Revenue

462
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,543
To address some other problems

463
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
I think eventually

464
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
I might come around.

465
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:06,527
I'd love to have this interview in five years and see how much closer we are or maybe we can talk about how well it's working

466
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,647
Vitamin E listeners tuned in July 2018 we will have a follow-up

467
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:16,255
Years time we could be walking around

468
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,303
Hi May I

469
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
Get room number to three

470
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
To Gilbert Metcalf

471
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,447
Get Back cast

472
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
Hey this is Robert Smith from Planet Money

473
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
Where where are you right now

474
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
Time in Gothenburg Sweden

475
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Where I'm attending the world

476
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,967
Congress of environmental and resource economy

477
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
Nice

478
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
So

479
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
Do you know why we're calling you

480
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,623
Nope I'll give you a hint

481
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,695
It's been exactly 5 years since we talked to you last

482
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Okay

483
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:53,119
Well here let me let me play you back from 5 years ago

484
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,655
I'd love to have this interview

485
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
5 years

486
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Or maybe we can talk about

487
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
How well it's working

488
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,591
Vitamin E listeners tuned in July 2018

489
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919
You were so optimistic

490
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,735
Well I continue to be optimistic Robert

491
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,319
We have a carbon tax in British Columbia we have a carbon tax

492
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,879
Sweden is $130 a ton

493
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,208
I'm sitting here looking at a thriving economy

494
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:22,304
That doesn't seem to be you know on its knees because of the carbon tax

495
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,376
But in terms of us five years was

496
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
Perhaps too optimistic

497
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
Perhaps I should have said

498
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,728
8 to 10 years

499
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,312
So we don't have a national carbon tax but here's what has changed

500
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,152
We now have the number of very very senior Republican

501
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,224
Who are saying we really need a carbon tax

502
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,040
So I think that that's progress

503
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,856
So one thing that did happen in The Last 5 Years

504
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
2016

505
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,232
A carbon tax was on the ballot in Washington state is very similar

506
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,072
To the one-page plan that we talked about in the show

507
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
Voters in Washington State

508
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,936
Rejected that carbon tax and surprisingly

509
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,984
A number of environmentalist

510
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
Rejected

511
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,336
What was the issue there

512
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
So

513
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
Part of the issue is

514
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
That

515
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,064
Some groups wanted to use the revenue to pay for for green projects

516
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
Others wanted to give it back

517
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,672
Two households to a carbon dividend

518
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,256
And there was and there was this disagreement about what to do there

519
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280
So

520
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,840
Professor Metcalf we're going to call you

521
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,888
In July of

522
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
2B 2023

523
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
5 years from now

524
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,776
Any prediction

525
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:39,872
Well I'm going to be a little more cautious than I was 5 years ago

526
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,712
I won't have it we will definitely have a carbon tax but I think

527
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
I think we're on the path

528
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
I think we're going to have one

529
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
If not within 5 years

530
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
I think

531
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:56,256
I think definitely within the decade okay a decade I'm going to put this down July 2028

532
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
Will call you back look forward to talking to you

533
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:05,472
Other promises that we

534
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
We really should follow up on

535
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:14,176
Well let us know Planet Money at npr.org we can find us on all the usual social networks

536
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Facebook

537
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,968
Instagram

538
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,992
And Twitter
