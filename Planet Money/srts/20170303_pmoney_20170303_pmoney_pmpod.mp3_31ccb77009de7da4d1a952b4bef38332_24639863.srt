Joseph E stiglitz

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
So there was a financial

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
I remember this

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:19,968
And then we argued for a while.

8
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,784
What to do about it and a few years after the financial crisis

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,832
Congress passed a great big lot

10
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,112
Call Dodd-Frank

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,928
That was supposed to transform the way the financial system

12
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,024
One thing our new President Donald Trump has made clear

13
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560
He does not like.

14
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,912
Anna. Frank is a disaster when it be doing a big number of Dodd-Frank

15
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,472
We have to get rid of Dodd-Frank we expect to

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,568
You got it a lot out of Dodd-Frank

17
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,360
We have a president

18
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
Who says he

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,920
Is going to be doing a great thing then

20
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,456
We are Planet Money

Patricia bath

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,784
Let's do it

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,368
So I think about that Frank is you know we talked about it like it is this one

24
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,672
Sing like it if the singular object

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440
Time for that

26
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,720
I'm against typing

27
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
That is not

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
The right way to think about

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,656
The drink is actually many many different things like all these different rules about all these different parts of the financial

30
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,192
All kind of rolled into one

31
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
We are going to talk to a bunch of different

32
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,104
In all different parts of the of the financial system

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
The country

34
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,176
About these different pieces of Dodd-Frank

35
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,808
And we're going to ask now that the Trump Administration is here what is going to happen to these different parts

36
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
And I started

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,160
I started with Barney Frank

38
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
The former Congressman whose name is on the

39
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,768
Why is it that Frank instead of franked

40
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,864
American history

41
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,912
You ever think of it as Frank.

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
No I don't think about you

43
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:50,592
Much of the time I refer to it as a financial Reform Bill is there some parts I'm title

44
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,872
Of the

45
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
Law that is

46
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,760
Especially important to you you have a favorite

47
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,832
Especially if they are people who have more than one child

48
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,440
And I wonder whether they have a particular child that they treasure over the others

49
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,304
Religion nice. That's not the way we live our life really love this wall like a baby

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
I mean that's why are you really

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Is it

52
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,680
And that you're conscious distortion on your part

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,992
I'm very angry suddenly sting like a bee I mean I talk to Barney Frank for a while and he helped me understand the lawn

54
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Think about what might happen

55
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,368
But he did not want to play along with the whole pick one part of the law is let's go.

56
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,208
Fortunately I talk to a lot of other people for the show and those interviews

57
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
Went much better

70
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,096
British show we really wanted to get into

71
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
The guts

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Of Dodd-Frank

73
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
Tear this thing apart

74
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,288
So we call it some people who have a big stake

75
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,384
And ask them to talk to us about the part of the law that they care about the

76
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
And we started with someone who has it

77
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
Pretty obvious take

78
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
Oh by the way tell me your name what's your name

79
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
My name is Rebecca Romero Rainey

80
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
And what's your job

81
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
I'm chairman and CEO of Central Bank

82
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
Who runs a bank

83
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
Obviously she cares about Dodd-Frank

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
She talked to me from her office

85
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
In Taos New Mexico

86
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,655
I look out the window of my office I see the gorgeous Taos mountains

87
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,471
Excellent snow right now great time to go skiing

88
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,567
Sun is shining we have incredible Vistas I can see forever around here

89
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
That's a good sales

90
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,199
Play banker and Chamber of Commerce all the time

91
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,271
Rennies bank has 220 million dollars in

92
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
Which would be a lot of money to

93
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
To me say

94
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Metrobank it is

95
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Kraynak's

96
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,207
The big National Banks you know Citibank

97
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
Chase

98
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
They're like

99
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,559
10 times bigger than her bank or a hundred times bigger

100
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
There are thousands of times bigger than raney's

101
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Is a lot of the Dodd-Frank rules that

102
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
Giant trillion-dollar Banks also apply to trainees

103
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,847
Rainy and a lot of people who run small Bank

104
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
State fit in a lot of cases

105
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,991
It just doesn't make any sense to use the same rules for such vastly

106
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,319
Different kinds of Banks and this is true for a lot of rules in Godfrey

107
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,647
Especially the part about mortgage lending which is like you know

108
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,183
Bread-and-butter Small Town Bank

109
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,023
It's just I have a sense just give me one example

110
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,703
So what we're talking about is title 14 of Dodd-Frank which is the mortgage reform and anti predatory lending a

111
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,031
Specifically subtitle F appraisal a

112
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Activities

113
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,919
And section 1472 as it relates to appraisal Independence

114
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Requirements

115
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,479
I had no idea

116
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
Enneagram

117
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,343
And that's just one section

118
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
1 subsection

119
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,159
Subtitle

120
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
Section

121
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,999
1472

122
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Your sit down

123
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
Read. Frank Jacob I bought it on the Kindle

124
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,119
So like I could have

125
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
Thumb through it

126
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,007
It's okay on appraisal right you talking about appraisal

127
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,335
Which is this thing you get when you're going to get a mortgage to buy a

128
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Somebody an appraiser

129
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
How to figure out

130
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
How much that house is worth have to appraise

131
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,295
During the housing bubble some appraisers were pressured by Banks to

132
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
To overstate the value of house

133
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
So that the banks could make

134
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,719
Reasonably Dodd-Frank tried to crack down on this

135
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,047
Section 14 subsection 1470

136
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
There are lots of rules about appraisals in.

137
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
Including this one that says

138
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,959
A bank cannot always rely on the same appraiser

139
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,751
Have to rotate through many different

140
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Keep them in Japan

141
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
Yeah you're in a large city you've got a

142
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
Hunnid appraisers to work with not a problem

143
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
Enroll markets

144
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,271
We're fortunate to have one or two in a lot of other markets

145
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,831
There are no local appraisers anymore

146
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,719
And so it just it's becoming more and more challenging to then be able to meet the requirements of the law

147
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,791
And so how many appraisers do you have in in

148
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
How many pages are there in

149
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
So we were Kodama with two different appraiser

150
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
And is that enough

151
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
Does it count as rotating if you have to

152
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
Well we're working through that

153
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
To hopefully ensure the

154
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,967
Did The Regulators interpret that to be the case cuz that's all we have to work with

155
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
And are you worried is either one of them like near retirement age

156
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,647
I hope not going to work forever

157
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,719
And so this one little rule that she's worried about

158
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:32,607
Is ghetto part of this whole stack of new rules that Rebecca Romero rain has to follow every time

159
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
She makes a mortgage

160
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
Uniworld to say

161
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
Which Bank employees can do which

162
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Have

163
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Rules that require new

164
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Kind of paperwork for the bank

165
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:44,895
And you know there is a way in which more complicated rules actually favored big Banks over small bag

166
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,711
A big bank already has a centralized

167
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Compliance officer

168
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
People whose whole job

169
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
It is to deal with

170
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
The complex reggae

171
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,927
Rainy by comparison whole bank has a total of 48 employees

172
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
Vitalik you can just

173
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Have some giant compliance

174
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,303
Okay so bad is the situation

175
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
Do we have any idea

176
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,655
Under the Trump Administration with the Republican Congress

177
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:13,055
What is going to happen to this part of Dodd-Frank so this is one of the things I talked about with Barney Frank other people

178
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,407
One thing about Community Banks in particular is their politically pretty

179
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
You know a lot of Congress people have a

180
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Community Bank in their District

181
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,903
It does seem like there's a pretty good chance that some of the mortgage lending rules and Dodd-Frank could be tweaked to go easier on small bag

182
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:35,071

I think you know you you me a question back

In the day whatever whether or not it was a mullet

192
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
Is it a mullet

193
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
No it's not a mall

194
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159

Cut the ribbon

202
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
A derivative is basically a

203
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,199
Bat in the case of the financial crisis they were all these bets

204
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
The people had placed on the mortgage

205
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
Marketon on how the housing

206
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,135
They were sued volumes of these bets were being made going back in

207
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,207
And the Whitworth before the crisis is it was just like

208
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
One Banker would call up another inside

209
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023

Distributive

211
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Sure and they would make the deal

212
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
And that would be it and nobody would know

213
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
Who was betting on what

214
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,471
Totally non-transfer

217
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
When the housing market

218
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
Everybody, looked around and said

219
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
Who is on the hook for these derivatives now

220
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
Nobody knew the answer

221
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
That we had a big boogie man

222
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
Leading up to 2008

223
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,111
We didn't know what

224
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
That was the problem

225
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,951
We had no darn clue

226
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
What the heck was going on

227
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,815
The part of Dodd-Frank that part Chilton feel strongly about

228
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
Tries to solve that problem

Section 723

234
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Clearing

235
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Clearing

236
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,223
Because of Dodd-Frank those derivatives easy

237
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
To be traded over

238
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,063
The phone by Bankers now have to be traded out in the

239
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
What are known as

240
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Clearing House

241
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
Basically like a stock market

242
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
But for derivative

243
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,767
And these clearinghouses together with other new rules they do a few things

244
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,143
For one thing they give Regulators a picture of who is doing what they make the market more trans

245
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,519
It's for another at the bank or insurance company or whoever is trading can't cover their bets

246
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
The Clearing House

247
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
Itself

248
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
Is now on the hook

249
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
So now course

250
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
That clearing house has a very strong and say

251
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
To make sure that everyone can cover their back

252
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
The buck stops there

253
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
Exactly and you know that seems good

254
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,135
Because the Clearinghouse is on the hook

255
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
You don't have this

256
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
Credible amount of risk

257
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,487
Concentrated in the clearing

00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Salata box

Memebox

260
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
Stop at the Clearing House

261
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
So you know I asked you

262
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
Guess you never moved the rest

263
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,191
But have you improve the cyst

264
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,031
Two clearinghouses allow us to understand

265
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
What the risk is

266
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,871
We can disagree whether or not they are appropriate

267
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
Rules that Shore up

268
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
The Clearing Houses

269
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,271
And that's something that should be constantly calibrated

270
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Much better

271
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,367
They want we had when they were big dark unregulated Market

272
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
Atleast we know about

273
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
It's not hitting like it was

274
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,023
Exactly and he says unbalanced like that alone

275
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Makes it that much better

276
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,887
Say in terms of you know what's going to happen to Dodd-Frank

277
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
This part of Dodd-Frank

278
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
Clearing house rules for derivatives

279
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Seems

280
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Pretty Poppy

281
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
It seems like

282
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:01,919
You know the industry has gotten used to it people generally agree with Chilton that the trade-off they're worth it

283
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
Clearing House a good idea so

284
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
Clearing house rules in Dodd-Frank

285
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
Here to stay

286
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:17,791
Stacey Vanek Smith my favorite writer about finances

287
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,119
You still work as a corporate lawyer as an investment banker now he writes this

00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
Column for Bloomberg view that as I am

289
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,215
Endlessly thing around the office

290
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
It's just like thoughtful

291
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
And funny

292
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
And not ideological and just

293
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,151
You know very often you get the sense that Matt Levine sees the world

294
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
In a way that nobody else

295
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Lots of course

296
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
I asked him

297
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,991
Come in and

298
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Talk to me about.

299
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,927
There's some part of everything but I think the volcker rule is fascinating

300
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,999
It eliminates things about painting in frankly about politics

301
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
The volcker rule

302
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
Here boiled down to one sentence is

303
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Double garage

304
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
Section 619 a

305
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
1A

306
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Lb. Frank.

307
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:03,103
Unless otherwise provided in the section A banking entity shall not engage in proprietary trading

308
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
What's proprietary

309
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,967
Hunter training means trading with your own money

310
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
Soting if your bank

311
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
You can't

312
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,855
Trade with your own man and encased trade means

313
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
That's right

314
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
The volcker rule tries to divide the world into

315
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
Stuff we want thanks

316
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,583
And stuff we don't want that

317
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,935
The stuff we do want things to do category include

318
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,751
Helping their customers who want to make trade

319
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
Who want to buy and sell things

320
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,823
Market maker

321
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:34,847
Is the technical

322
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,943
In the category of things we do not want things to do

323
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
Proprietary

324
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
That is when a bank

325
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
Mike makes a bet in the market

326
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
Just to make money for it

327
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,159
Not in service of its customer or getting a

328
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
Adjust

329
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,303
But distinguishing between those two things between proprietary trading witch

330
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,839
Which is bad and market-making which

331
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,911
She's good can be harder than then I would have thought

332
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
People say I'm a bank

333
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
Stacy German customer

334
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,591
Okay you want to sell a bond at a bonds for to buy it

335
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,871
So I buy from you

336
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
Because you're my customer right

337
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
And I'm a bank

338
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Then I turn around

339
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
And I sell them on to somebody else

340
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
For more than I paid

341
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
I just made a profit

342
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
So now

343
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:23,231
Am I helping you out or am I making a risky bet trading Bonds in the market

344
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,815
The volcker rule has tied itself in knots trying to answer that

345
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
You brought

346
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,519
Pretty fast

347
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
Like crazy fast

348
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:43,199
So when it happened is like on the volcker was finalized it is 955 Pages not quite true

349
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
Voter list 72

350
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,319
Came with 882 heads preamble

351
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
Useful to explain

352
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,231
So it is emblematic write the simple idea

353
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,791
Hundreds of pages of explanation trying to

354
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Clarify what it is

355
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,119
It's right and this is like a classic

356
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Regulatory problem

357
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,983
But living said yes okay the details Get Ridiculous

358
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,823
But to really understandable cruel you got to get Beyond The Hunt

359
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,103
Pages and zoom out

360
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,127
Forget about the Tea

361
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
Look at the way the volcker rule has

362
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
Change the world

363
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,575
If you like just think about like what it forbids how you can game it and whatever

364
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
If it feels record

365
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
But if you stop a cancer to look at what's happened

366
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,023
Banks have gotten rid of their proprietary trading decks

367
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
Desks that business is gone

368
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
And that mindset difference

369
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,191
Matters like all the people having fun to make $100

370
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,799
Those people whatever their living on their private islands or maybe their work

371
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,567
Hedge funds

372
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:47,967
But whatever they're doing they are not working at banks that hold ordinary people's money for safekeeping and government in Troy

373
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
Any food banks more boring which I think was

374
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,575
Lakeview overriding goal

375
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
Post-2008 Financial

376
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
One last thing about the volcker rule

377
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:03,583
President Trump's treasury secretary Steven mnuchin has said he supports the volcker rule in general

378
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,119
But he says it should be simple

379
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,775
Maybe not, 200 pages

380
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,871
Next up we talked to John Cochran

381
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
He's an economist at the

382
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
The Hoover Institute

383
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
And he

384
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
Love's

385
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,527
I'm going to say something I want you to give me just

386
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
One word a couple words

387
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
Minimum wage

388
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
Counterproductive

389
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
Government regulation

390
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
How many words do I get on this way

391
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,751
Often well-intended adverse consequences

392
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,055
Gums up the works

393
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
Thanks

394
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Thanks

395
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,527
Huge crony capitalists nightmare

396
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
Top-ranked

397
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
In terms of

398
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:03,231
Regulation that Lanza fourth we need a big bonfire you say a big bonfire what do we need to burn

399
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
Almost of Dodd-Frank

400
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
List of the subsidiary regulations

401
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
And most of the

402
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
Regulatory system that failed

403
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
And setup.

404
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
So does that mean we need to burn like

405
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,871
What almost a hundred years now of sort of ideas about how we should

406
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Regulate things

407
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
Yeah I almost done

408
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,247
It's so extreme

409
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
Yeah you're not not

410
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Entirely on

411
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,183
Here is what's interesting to me about

412
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,767
Goodnight she does not think we should burn the rules in life

413
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,887
Oh just leave Banks alone let thanks B banks that is not where he is coming from on the

414
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,959
In fact you look sad on Frank and yes he sees

415
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
There are a million new rules

416
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,567
But they do not solve this fundamental

417
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Too big to

418
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,199
Too-big-to-fail banks are still too big to fail

419
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Adidas

420
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
This is for a pretty simple reason

421
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,575
Thanks for playing almost entirely

422
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,623
With money they have borrowed from other

423
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,439
And it's this borrowing that makes the banks

424
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
The old

425
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Too much money too

426
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Too many people

427
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,583
Joe Cochran looks at this world and he says you know what

428
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
Let's do something that's actually way more rat

429
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,959
Let's do something in fact that Banks themselves

430
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
Really do not want to do

431
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
Kisses

432
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,871
Let's tell Banks they cannot use so much borrowed money

433
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
Because that's the problem so let's say

434
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
Thank you cannot do that one thing

435
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,551
In the most extreme version of his pitch he says you know it

436
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
Let's not let Banks use

437
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
Any borrowed money at all

438
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
I mean that sounds

439
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,975
Fury like a reasonable idea but

440
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,511
So extreme

441
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,119
So what happens when you pitch this idsa in washing

442
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
You can understand the way

443
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,007
Policyworks especially big things like

444
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,383
Assertive say Cochran persuaded me so we're going to tear up Dodd-Frank and we're going to do this

445
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:01,503
Ideas have to have to percolate around and everyone has to sort of understanding

446
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
And they are

447
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
It sounds like the idea is just

448
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
It's going better than he makes it sound in fact

449
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,999
Both Republicans and Democrats are talking a lot about

450
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
Requiring Banks to you

451
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
Use more of Their Own

452
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
Requiring more

453
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:15,839
Capital One

454
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
And that is one of the things

455
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
The people say Ken actually

456
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,447
Help prevent

457
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
Another Financial

458
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
Yes more of their own money

459
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
Less broad money makes Bank

460
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
And in fact

461
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,919
Capital requirements have gone up in the post Dodd-Frank world

462
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,479
Under the Trump Administration now Capital requirements

463
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,295
Could go up even further and they are unlikely to

464
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
To go back down

465
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
So slowly but surely the world

466
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
Is moving in Cochrane

467
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:46,559
Okay yes

468
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,631
No it went so fast

469
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,423
Finally we have Sarah Ludwig

470
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,495
Who runs a nonprofit in New York called the new economy

471
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
And back in 2005

472
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,151
They created this hotline the phone number for people to call if they needed help

473
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,687
You know dealing with the financial

474
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,247
So we thought we were going to get a lot of calls

475
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551
About rent-to-own stores

476
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
Or

477
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
Payday loans

478
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,719
Or you know people who were trying to get access to a bank account

479
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
That is not what

480
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,863
Pretty much from the get-go the phone rang off the hook and almost

481
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
Every single

482
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,447
Call we got in this is not what we were expecting

483
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,495
We're from people who were saying

484
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,311
That they had found their bank accounts Frozen

485
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
Or their wages were garnished

486
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:35,711
Lily and her colleagues looked into it and they found this whole industry they didn't

487
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Even know

488
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,039
Companies that would buy up overdue debt

489
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
Medical debt credit card debt

490
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
And then file lawsuit

491
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Suits to collect

492
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,183
And she says the company is filing the lawsuit

493
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,463
We're very aggressive

494
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,791
In many cases they were breaking the law in collecting this

495
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,327
But nobody was going out

496
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
And here

497
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Is where Dodd-Frank

498
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,167
Title 10

499
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,727
Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection

500
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,055
Subtitle a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection

501
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,615
Section 1011

502
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,711
Establishment of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection

503
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,015
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

504
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Cfpb

505
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,599
It is a government agency created by.

506
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,952
Everything about the cfpb is normally with regulatory

507
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,512
They are organized by what they regulate

508
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
SEC Reg

509
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,560
Stocksund

510
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
The FDIC regulate

511
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,656
Thanks but the sister did is is organized

512
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,216
Turtle by point of view write specifically

513
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,544
It's created around the point of view of the consumer

514
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,896
And you know as a result the cfpb has started enforcing laws

515
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
That were on the books for decades lost that are not part of Dodd-Frank but these laws had largely gone unused they were just kind

516
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Sitting there

517
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:49,440
One of these lost their Olympic says he's an old law that covers what debt collectors can and cannot do

518
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,000
The Federal Trade Commission

519
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
Had

520
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,584
That was the agency that was charged with enforcing this law

521
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,912
It didn't really do much it brought a few actions here and there

522
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,216
That's the magic of the cfpb

523
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,008
Is that it breathes life

524
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
Into these laws

525
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,336
On the box for very long time in a way that

526
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
No other agency

527
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,920
Ludwig says she can see the difference

528
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:16,064
So how long is still open and we're getting calls about a lot of things but the number of people calling about abusive

529
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,112
Collection particularly about

530
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,184
These debt buyers that are suing people that has

531
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Absolute

532
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
Way way way.

533
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
Ludwig obviously loves the

534
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,072
The cfpb

535
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
A many Republicans do not

536
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:35,520
They say that it has too much power that it has attacked the financial system and made it harder for people to borrow money

537
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:40,384
And so of course I asked everybody I talked to what is likely to happen to the cfpb in this

538
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
In this new political

539
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:47,040
To get rid of the cfpb entirely would require 60 votes in the Senate

540
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
I could you have to change the law

541
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:53,952
Republicans have 52 votes Democrats generally like the cfpb so that means

542
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:57,280
The cfpb is probably not going to go away altogether

543
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
It'll probably stay

544
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
But

545
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,168
President Trump will get to appoint a new head of the cfpb

546
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
Likely to be much less aggressive

547
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
And

548
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,544
Congress could cut way back on Sunday

549
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Pretty agency

550
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
Which could of course make adjustments

551
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
And that's really the picture for Dodd-Frank more Jenner

552
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
The way that it is

553
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:18,016
Forced could change a lot but it probably won't go away

554
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,112
I'll probably still be around for us to argue about when

555
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
The next financial

556
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,840

I got to come up with another

I'd love to do a story that's like a process story about how a business

567
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
It was this

568
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:04,352
Magazine story read a few years ago I loved it was

569
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,424

Dodd-Frank

592
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,000
Any politician who refers to himself in the third person

593
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
Looks ridiculous with one except

594
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,352
I'd like General Charles de Gaulle

595
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
He was able to take

596
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
A phone say the goal is with you

597
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,496
And not look like a twist

598
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,568
But any other politician who refers to himself in the third person

599
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Look for dick
