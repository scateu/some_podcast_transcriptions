1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:01,792
Hate just a quick note

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
The show originally ran in

3
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,096
In mm

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,168
Sam Cohen is a business

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,496
He's in a business that until recently I didn't even know existed

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:14,336
So recently I asked Sam if you show me how is business works

7
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
And he said sure

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,640
Where we going right now

9
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,944
I will go to Toys R Us

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
What are you hoping to find a Toys R Us

11
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,040
Anything we can make money off

12
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,344
A picture of the coins business works like

13
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,392
He walks in the big box

14
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928
Stores like Toys R Us

15
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,208
You get the car

16
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,536
People stuff off the shelves then goes up to the cash register and pays for

17
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,072
Just like any other shopper

18
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
Penny Drive

19
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,168
Stop back to his warehouse and sells it for a profit on Amazon

20
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,984
And this is not just some guy clipping coupons as a hobby

21
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,800
Sam is a warehouse about a dozen full-time

22
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Employees

23
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,616
This is a multi-million dollar business for sale

24
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
Ancelotti

25
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,200
This is a thing people do now

26
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,016
Buying stuff at stores and selling it for more online

27
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,064
It's called Retail Arbitrage

28
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,648
You can buy special software to do it there are online tutorials that

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,928
Did you how

30
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,720
How is this even a job

31
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,000
Much less an industry

32
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
I mean how is it possible that you can build a business around buying stuff off the shelves at retail stores and

33
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,192
Cylinder online for a little more

34
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,240
Actually he's selling it for a lot more

35
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:18,848
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

36
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,152
Today on the show Sam Cohen is a middleman

37
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
And he's in the middle of War

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
On one side you got the giant big box chain

39
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,576
On the other you got Amazon and in between them

40
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,648
There is Sam Cohen driving around New Jersey in a beat-up

41
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
This message comes from NPR sponsor

42
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
Capital One

43
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
Capital One

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
Is reimagining banking

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
I offering account

46
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
With no fees or minute

47
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,056
Animals that can be open from anywhere

48
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
In 5 minutes

49
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Capital One

50
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
What's in your wallet

51
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
Capital One na

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,736
It seems like Sam's business

53
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
And this whole industry

54
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
Should not exist

55
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
Because there is this thing called The Law of one price

56
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,672
Which is the diff everything is working the way it should

57
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,744
The same product should have the same price everywhere

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Like the Nerf football should cost

59
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,304
The same at Target

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
As it as a Toys R Us

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
As it does on Amazon

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
Because if it's cheaper in one of those places

63
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:20,800
People will figure that out and they will just go buy it where it's cheaper and in fact the law of One Price means

64
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
Sam Cohen has a hard job

65
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,896
Most of the stuff at Toys R Us

66
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
Does sell for about the

67
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
The same price on Amazon

68
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
But he also knows

69
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
But there's got to be something

70
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Something right here in the

71
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
Store that he can make money

72
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
He doesn't know what it is but he knows he can find

73
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
We start walking through the aisles

74
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
Need Sam and one of Sam's employees a guy named Jay Friday

75
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,960
Sam tells me why one thing after another is not going to

76
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,568
Graco car seat is probably too big

77
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:58,944
Really big things cost alot to ship so to pay for shipping and still make a profit same would have to charge a ton

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
Around the corner and starts looking upwards

79
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,576
Something that's a staple item like Scrabble

80
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
I don't think you'll ever make money on B

81
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
Because it's a commodity item

82
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
It's too popular

83
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Everybody sells

84
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
And all those sellers compare

85
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
Keep with each other

86
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
Keep lowering the price and lowering the price

87
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
There's no way I'm going to be able to make a profit selling

88
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Scrapple

89
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
But on the shelf right below

90
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Scrabble there all these

91
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
Special Scrabble Deluxe Scrabble super Scrabble Frozen Scrabble

92
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
In the Disney movie

93
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,992
Princess Anna and Queen Elsa right there on the box

94
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,576
Games like frozen Scrabble Sam says can be right in this

95
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,928
Spot where they're not so popular that everybody's going to sell them and there's no profit

96
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,280
But they're popular enough that he can be pretty confident that he'll be able to sell it

97
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Today though

98
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,352
Even Frozen Scrabble stays on the Shelf

99
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,376
He's not going to buy it

100
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,424
Because this is the wrong season

101
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,728
Scrabble for board games and general

102
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
They're basically holiday

103
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,872
Right now they're not on sale here and it's April so that doesn't make sense

104
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:06,272
Finally around the corner from the board games sammc something promising so this is interesting this is a babe

105
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
Babies R Us 800

106
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,344
Baby wipes

107
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,624
The wipes are on this

108
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,208
Play one of those great big things right out in the middle of the aisle

109
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,047
They're selling for $16.99 17 bucks

110
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,863
I have myself I have two young daughters

111
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,727
I made price-conscious Chopper and I feel like I have some insight on the baby wipes

112
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Soap I tell Sam

113
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
Baby stuff I know how much baby stuff cost

114
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,871
I'm not great it's not great

115
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
800 wipes it's a valuable I mean by it if you want I don't think

116
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,343
I think there's a lot of margin in Florida I think you're wrong

117
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,159
Sam and Jay take out their phones and get to work

118
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:50,559
So we scan the UPC barcode over here and right there on his phone he can see all the time for

119
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
About how the babies are us

120
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
800 wipes

121
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Value box

122
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
Is selling on Amazon

123
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,263
Basically you see what category it's in you see the size

124
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
Tear that a Tim

125
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,175
You see the sales rank as compared to all the other items in the category

126
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
You see how many people are selling

127
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
And crucially you see the price that is

128
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:10,783
Selling for

129
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,111
So this box of wipes are selling for $17 here at Toys R Us

130
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,231
And on Amazon this is currently selling for $46

131
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Wait a minute

132
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,863
People are paying what did you say for 800 baby wipes

133
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
It's a lie

134
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
Even when you add up all the Sam's Club

135
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
Shipping the wife's to Amazon's Warehouse

136
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
He's got to pay to Amazon

137
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,567
The list of wipes on their site

138
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,663
The other fees he's got to pay to Amazon to ship the wipes again out to customers

139
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
You know what all that Sam figures he can make

140
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
$14

141
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,039
Profit on every box

142
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
For some reason

143
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
The law of one

144
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
That wall that says

145
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,463
The same thing should have basically the same price everywhere

146
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,815
Does not seem to apply to this value box of 800 Babies R Us baby

147
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,143
It seems right if you actually can unload all these

148
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Is wipes at that 40

149
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
$6 price

150
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
He'll make money

151
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,287
Sojay Friday grabs every box of wipes in the display

152
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
And puts them in

153
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,383
Before we check out Sam spots a couple others

154
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
Thanks where he thinks he can make a profit

155
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
This is called a Little Tikes

156
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
Big Tigger

157
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,647
Sandbox take wraps all the sand boxes and put them in the car and one last thing it's a slumber bag

158
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:24,255
Like a sleeping bag for inside the rebels with a bonus backpack

159
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
Jay puts all the sleeping bags in the

160
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,863
Which is now overflowing with sandboxes

161
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Sleeping bags

162
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
Princess this is actually just a small QuikTrip

163
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,031
Usually they spend half a day and still up a bunch of cards

164
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,615
Are cashiers seems completely unfazed by this card.

165
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,479
Sam pays for the stuff and we take it out to the car

166
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
Few weeks later I called sandbox

167
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
To see how he did with all this

168
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
Because so far

169
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
He's bought this

170
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,439
But yeah

171
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Sold it hasn't made any profit

172
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
And you know

173
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,303
Nobody wants to buy from him on Amazon

174
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
You can be kind of screw

175
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
But before we get to how Sam did

176
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
Let's look at the Toys R Us side of the

177
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
This equation

178
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Because if there is all this extra money

179
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
To be made on baby wipes

180
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,591
Why doesn't Toys R Us just raised the price in the store

181
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,223
Or why doesn't it just cut out the middleman why doesn't play the rest just sell baby wipes on Amazon itself

182
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
Yeah you know I reached out

183
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
Toys R Us to ask them these very Quest

184
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
And

185
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,903
And I also reached out to Walmart and

186
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Targets

187
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
Add to Kohl's in the Home Depot

188
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
And not one of them

189
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
Agreed to be interviewed for this story

190
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:36,191
But there is this one story that's been out there in the news that suggest retailers

191
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
Our kind of

192
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Freaking out about

193
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Businesses likes

194
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,359
The story involves Target and a clothing designer Lilly Pulitzer

195
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
I learned about the story from Ina Steiner

196
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,967
Who writes a newsletter for people who sell stuff on

197
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:53,599
Target to the deal a special deal they collaborated with a designer called Lilly Pulitzer

198
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,951
To come up with 250 different items that were special made

199
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
For Target

200
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Sundresses

201
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Flip flops

202
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,303
Resort Wear

203
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
Very distinctive

204
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
Does that mean palm trees I don't know what the hell

205
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
Very colorful pastels

206
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,847
Do people love this stuff they love Lilly Pulitzer clothes and Target sold out almost immediately

207
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,895
Except for a lot of people buying the stuff on the

208
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
Dresses and flip flops

209
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
We're not actually people were planning on wearing them

210
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
Almost immediately.

211
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,319
These products showed up online marked way up

212
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,391
And consumers got really really upset

213
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,999
Speak out cry on social media one lady said on Twitter that there is a

214
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Special place in hell

215
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,863
If you bought Willie today to sell it on eBay

216
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,447
It's a real anger that is so anger

217
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
Those flip-flops are cute you know

218
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
People like

219
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,847
Target of course is on Twitter targeted people who pay attention

220
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
The stuff

221
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
And they

222
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Responded

223
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
And it wasn't just about Lilliput

224
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
Ina Steiner

225
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,807
Started hearing stories and this is just in the past few weeks now

226
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Now she started hearing stories

227
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
About resellers about people like Sam

228
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Who went

229
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
Target filled up their cart

230
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
Took me or whatever

231
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,583
20 identical boxes of Lego sets or something up to the

232
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
Couch and when they get to the cash register their told

233
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,191
Nope sorry we are not going to sell the

234
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
20 boxes of whatever

235
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
You can't find

236
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
I reached out to

237
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
To Target and they said they had

238
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,847
Change their policy

239
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
You had some particular language

240
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
From Target

241
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
That you had

242
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
Posted from a statement they sent you happen to have that can you just

243
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Repeat that

244
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
I'm hanging on

245
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,487
In order to ensure we have the inventory of products

246
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
To meet our guests needs

247
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,351
We recently established a new policy that Reserves

248
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
Target the right to prohibit purchases

249
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,679
Teresa sellers

250
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,751
So they're saying explicitly

251
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,359
If you want to come in and buy all our fancy new dresses so you can sell them online

252
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
We can say no

253
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Exact

254
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
The big fear for Target here

255
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,807
Is that one day soon there will be no reason

256
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
At all to go to

257
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
Kohl's or Walmart

258
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:03,903
Or anywhere

259
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,719
Because you can just go to Amazon and buy it online

260
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,279
You cannot underestimate the impact

261
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Set Amazon

262
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
Is having on retail

263
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
Amazon is

264
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,959
Is 800 pound gorilla that every retailer has nightmares about

265
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
Spear of Amazon explains a lot

266
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,639
It's a big part of the reason that Sam Collins business is whole Retail Arbitrage world

267
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Exist

268
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
Is Toys R Us wanted to

269
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,783
They could cut Sam Cohen and everyone liked him out of the loop in Tyler

270
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,343
Toys R Us could just sell its own wipes on

271
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
But the last

272
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
Finger Toys R Us One

273
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:41,279
Is for Shoppers to think of Amazon as the place where they can buy everything

274
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
Toys R Us does Dallas White song

275
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,887
They just don't sell them on Amazon

276
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
And that

277
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Create an opportunity for

278
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
We will hear how Sam did with those wipes

279
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031

Sam

288
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
I think about you and how you doing

289
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
Awesome awesome

290
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,423
Okay so a couple weeks ago we went to Toys R Us we bought some

291
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
Stuff and I want to see how how you're doing

292
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
Quick refresher payment butt wipes

293
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
He bought sleeping bags

294
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
And he bought sand

295
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
We started

296
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Of course with the white

297
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:33,503
I believe we have one or two left most of them of already full

298
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
And what did you sell them for

299
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
We saw them for $45

300
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,927
So I was definitely wrong about the baby wipes I want to say that

301
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
On the record

302
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:46,303
You know I made a really basic kind of rookie mistake

303
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,327
And thinking about the

304
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,631
Because you don't hear something that I know

305
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
You can almost always find a

306
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
A giant box of wine

307
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
Around 12

308
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
17 x 20 box

309
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
And that's what I always

310
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,615
He's bought I didn't care what kind I was just bought the

311
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
The cheap wipes

312
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,479
Yeah I think you shop really differently from the way that I stopped Jacob because

313
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
When I was looking through my Amazon purchases

314
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
I noticed that I hadn't actually really

315
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,415
Prices that much internal sump when I looked at them but I just wanted

316
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Everything now

317
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,487
I bought whatever could get shipped to be the fastest

318
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,071
And I think a lot of people work that way especially when it comes to baby

319
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
Used because people get very emotional about baby

320
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
He's probably also dogs

321
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
I would imagine

322
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,471
I'm so if a product is for a baby

323
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,287
And it's a particular kind of wipe that the baby seems to

324
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Like

325
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Or respond well to you

326
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,151
I feel like people go out of their way to continue to buy that burn

327
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
When you need wipes

328
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
You definitely need

329
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
White

330
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
You know

331
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,135
You can go on Amazon use your 1-click Amazon Prime

332
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
2-day delivery

333
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
You want your Babies R Us 800 wipes

334
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
You pay your 45 bucks

335
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
And you get it

336
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
.

337
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
And it turns out plenty of people

338
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
In fact have done that

339
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Sam was right

340
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
About the white

341
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,263
And he was right about the Star Wars Rebels sleeping bag suit currently those are cell

342
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,871
Pretty well but the last item the little digger sandbox has Little Tikes

343
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Spectators

344
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,199
The Little Tikes big digger sandbox has

345
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,759
Those are actually becoming kind of a problem for sale

346
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,807
Can't wait so he bought those at Toys R Us

347
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
439

348
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,903
And he was hoping to sell them on Amazon for 75

349
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
$5

350
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
Promise after

351
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
He bought them

352
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
The price started

353
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
Default

354
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,375
Middleman was getting undercut by other middlemen

355
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
He was getting out Middleman

356
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
Just this morning I looked at the pricing

357
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,007
And as of this morning

358
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:35,615
That sandbox was selling on Amazon for $39 at 99

359
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
The exact same price

360
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,455
Sam it paid at Toys R Us

361
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
At least

362
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,759
As of this moment

363
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
For the Little Tikes

364
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:49,439
Big digger sandbox the law of One Price seems to hold true

365
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,423
