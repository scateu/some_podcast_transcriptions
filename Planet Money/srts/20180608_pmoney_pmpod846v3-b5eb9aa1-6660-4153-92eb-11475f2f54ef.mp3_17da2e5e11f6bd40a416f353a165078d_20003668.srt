You can listen in any order and here's a show

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
There is

13
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,928
A type of person who follows

14
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,256
State Politics the way that some people follow High School football

15
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,304
And Dan Smith is one of

16
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,632
Dan is a political science professor at the universe

17
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,960
Florida and in the summer of 2011

18
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
He found himself

19
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,008
Glued to His Radio

20
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,080
These hearings were going on and I remember listening on the radio

21
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
To the series of

22
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,176
Public hearings across the state

23
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,784
They were hearings about this thing that Florida had just done that was kind of crazy

24
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,088
And that like Florida man marries

25
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,624
Is Burmese python crazy

26
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
It was crazy because

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,952
Florida had just up and become

28
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,744
Super politically response

29
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,816
The hearings were about this new law that Florida has

30
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,888
That could change politics there in a big

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
Very

32
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,472
Transparent opening of the

33
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,240
In process

34
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
2

35
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
Assure that

36
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,360
Why weren't going to be drawn to Advantage the Republican or Democratic Party

37
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,456
Florida is technically a swing state the population is pretty much

38
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,016
Split between Republicans and Democrats

39
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,600
When Florida started electing more Republicans in the 1990

40
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
And that was because of Jerry man

41
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,232
Where politicians draw maps in a way that favors their own party

42
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,304
Both Republicans and Democrats gerrymander but

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
In Florida at that time it was the Republican

44
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,216
And in 2010 the citizens of Florida said enough already

45
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
They outlawed partisan gerrymandering

46
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,336
Technically this was not great news for the Republican Party

47
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,664
But they said you know what citizens of Florida let's do this

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
In fact let's go nuts

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
You tell us

50
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
How to draw the

51
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,832
The state legislators put software online where citizens

52
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Could draw and see

53
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Submit their own

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,000
They went on a tour of 26 cities there were town halls for citizens to share their ideas

55
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,072
Annie's hearings were packed there sometimes standing-room-only

56
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:15,424
People would get up and they would testify about how they thought their districts should be drawn

57
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,824
But I would like to see us have a district where the student voice gets her Hardee County I definitely would like to see that

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,712
They keep us with the Inland counties like to be in the same district

59
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,992
People show up to these here

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,600
And regular people regular citizens be submit nearly 200

61
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,672
Play everybody is at his big redistricting pep rally

62
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,464
Citizens are putting maps in

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Politicians won't stop talking about how their process is

64
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,352
Is the most open and transparent in Florida's history

65
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
But then that

66
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,680
Political science Professor pedals

67
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,960
To His Radio

68
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,032
He's carrying something a little different than everyone else

69
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,336
And I remember hearing some people that I knew

70
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,944
Some of the people testifying at these hearings they're like hey I'm Average Joe from Jack

71
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,736
Jacksonville and dance like

72
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
This guy

73
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
Isn't

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,136
Just an ordinary citizen he's been working for Republican candidates this whole political career

75
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
How many citizens are not really talking like average

76
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
Chose

77
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,304
Most people were being real don't even know what district they live in

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,680
And yet some of these citizens seem to have strangely specific opinions about there.

79
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,800
Speaking about the importance of the I-75 Corridor and being on one side and

80
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
I using that as a

81
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,408
Border for this new District it would be created

82
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
South of Gainesville

83
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,552
Dimples out a notebook and he starts keeping track of these very knowledgeable

84
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,112
And after Gathering all of this

85
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,928
Input the Florida State Legislature releases

86
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976

89
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Still look

90
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Pretty gerrymander

91
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,960
And I'm not

92
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Clairvoyant person

93
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm just a cynic

94
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
I knew

95
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
That something was going on

96
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
What I didn't realize was the depth

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,320
Dan was about to find himself deep inside this mystery

98
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:16,256

117
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,295
Okay so this is early 2012 Florida politicians have gathered all that's

118
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
Citizen input and release new electoral Maps

119
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Right after those new map

120
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
Maps are released for the League of Women Voters has brought a legal challenge the map of Florida 27 Congressional

121
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,631
The League of Women Voters of Voting Rights group they say

122
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
Republicans

123
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,447
What we agreed to quarts

124
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,031
Make them draw those Maps again but nonpartisan for reals this

125
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:36,639
Right about this time Dan who was a registered Republican and gets an email

126
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
I get contacted

127
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,991
By the legal team working for the League of Women Voters

128
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,135
The woman who emailed and asked him can you help us analyze these maps and try to figure out what happened here

129
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,463
Dan is a full-time Professor so he already has a day job and

130
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
And a half

131
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,119
But he's also estate political junkie and he has very strong feelings about gerrymandering in Florida

132
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
It just makes you mad

133
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Maybe it's cuz

134
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,263
I've always been a competitive athlete and I

135
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
I know that I'm not always going to win

136
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Want to have that chance

137
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,687
And I don't want the deck stacked against me

138
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
The get-go

139
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
So he takes this righteous

140
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
Wonky anger

141
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
It says yes

142
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
I will help you

143
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,671
On my nights and weekends and whenever I can

144
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
It was a lot of

145
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
Piecemeal work that would come get working from home working in the evenings. Hours of the night

146
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
2012 he's analyzing the maps

147
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,239
Any very quickly Zooms in on one specific

148
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
District district 5

149
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
And it was clear that

150
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,407
That District was the key to the the overall Republican gerrymandering

151
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
Hurricane in Florida

152
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,503
To understand why that is true and what dance

153
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,063
Looking for you need to understand District

154
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
On the map

155
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,879
District 5 looks men

156
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,695
Kind of looks like someone spilled milk on Florida and

157
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Just gave it a name

158
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
The district

159
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815
Strips from Jacksonville all the way down to Orlando

160
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,679
District 5 is kind of the embodiment of gerrymandering in America

161
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
Not all gerrymandering is

162
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
The same there's partisan gerrymandering

163
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
Andrea that's what Florida made illegal

164
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
But there's another kind of gerrymandering that

165
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
Quartz sometimes actually order

166
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
Like Florida's District 5

167
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
That District was

168
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,855
Conceived and gerrymandered not by politicians but by the courts

169
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Because of the federal voting rights

170
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,951
Was one of the big civil rights laws

171
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
The 1960

172
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,327
Designed to make sure that black Americans could vote and elect representatives

173
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
What's a color the law saying basically this is America in order for black candidates to win their have to be

174
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
Enough black people in the district to Alexa

175
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:45,151
So this weirdly shaped spilled milk District 5 with deliberately created

176
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
To have enough minority voters

177
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
So that a minority candidate

178
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:49,759
Could Witten

179
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,807
And after the courts to district5 Battersea

180
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
Exactly what

181
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:59,743
I'm the first person in 129 years a Afro-American has been elected from Florida

182
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,607
This is former representative Corrine Brown celebrating her election in 1992

183
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,447
I come from a district of people who have not been apart of the system

184
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,287
Corrine Brown we have to say is now in jail on fraud charges

185
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
But the goal of District 5 it work

186
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
And many African Americans

187
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
In Florida

188
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Rejoice

189
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
So did Republican

190
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
For a really interesting reason

191
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
Black voters in Florida tend to vote for Democrat

192
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
So packing them into District

193
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,719
Five men that they weren't voting in sadist

194
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
4 weirdest

195
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
6

196
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,327
Which made it easier for Republican candidates

197
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Two windows now more white

198
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
District

199
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,471
They were putting African-Americans and districts that would allow

200
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,287
These districts to elect a minority

201
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
But as result

202
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Democrats started losing

203
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
More seats across the state

204
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
These packs

205
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
Minority districts like District 5

206
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
Are good for

207
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
Candidates of color

208
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Good for republicans

209
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,879
But overall

210
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
Not so good for Democrat

211
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
Packing districts like this

212
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,279
Becomes the thing it becomes a strategy for republicans

213
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,375
Dan knows that one of the best ways to even out the party

214
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:13,215
In balance in Florida is to unpack district5 to spread out that

215
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,543
When he sees the new maps release

216
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
East by the state legislature

217
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
District 5 is not on

218
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
In fact it's even more packed than both

219
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Before

220
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
Dan suspect that this has been done deliberately

221
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
And he starts to find proof

222
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
A republican consultant kind of

223
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,463
Spilled the beans on what was happening behind the scenes of the whole redist

224
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Printing process

225
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
The story that the consultant tells

226
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,119
Explain that weird thing with Dan did noticed while he was listening to

227
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,167
Mishpat

228
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,751
German my name is Alex Patton

229
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,287
This is Alex

230
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,895
He testified at a public hearing as you know a regular Joe citizen

231
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
But then nose

232
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,247
Alex is the longtime Republican operative

233
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,343
This consultant explains what's been going on with Alex and with some other

234
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,951
Republican legislators have been saying we do the maps away the citizens told us

235
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,767
Now then learns a small group of Republican

236
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
Consultants Drew secret maps

237
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
Then pass them off to people like Alex

238
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,959
Who then testified and submitted the maps like they drown themselves

239
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
They had

240
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,311
Actively smuggled partisanship into the final match

241
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,871
All in order to have you know

242
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Citizen

243
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Input

244
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,223
The dance has was for the Republicans to

245
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
Point to later to just

246
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Justify their partisan

247
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,855
Be citizen plans like Alex were assigned roles

248
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
His role was to act

249
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Confuse

250
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
Siri is talking at wannabe here

251
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
But I just don't understand the language

252
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
Remember when working in politics

253
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Next four years

254
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,287
But Alex Patton script didn't just say act confused

255
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,127
It also contained the Republicans most important talking point

256
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
Do you want to keep District 5 pack

257
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
So here's Alex's

258
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
However I want you to pay

259
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
Retention

260
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
To protect our right

261
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
Proportional districts

262
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,487
And the strong gains made

263
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,023
Dissipation

264
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,095
Nothing he just said protect minority games

265
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,423
What is essentially code for protect areas like

266
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,239
And legislators specifically

267
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
Pointed to statements like Alex's to justify key

268
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
Keeping District 5

269
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:32,991
Jeb regular Florida Citizens are really concerned about the diversity in District 5 we would love to

270
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
Impact District 5 but you know

271
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Citizens

272
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,319
Have spoken

273
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,903
Wind and seas the charade he knows exactly what to

274
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,023
He needs to find exact matches between Maps drawn by Republican control

275
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
Maps emitted by these so-called citizens

276
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
And the final legislative

277
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
Maps the maps that became law

278
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,751
This would prove that partisanship deed sneak its way into

279
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Final map

280
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
I was basically smuggled in by these Republican play

281
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,967
Because so many variables go into making any given map there literally millions

282
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Configurations

283
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,343
It is statistically almost impossible for two different

284
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
People to draw

285
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Exact same

286
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,951
To Spill the milk exactly the

287
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
So damn nose

288
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
If you can find any

289
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
Act match between 8

290
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
Consultant planted map

291
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
And one of the legislators final match

292
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
That is no coincidence

293
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,727
It would mean that legislators

294
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Basically just like

295
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
Copy pasted the Consulting

296
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
Danvers diving into the maps

297
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
And Bank

298
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
We found

299
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
A map that was submitted

300
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Supposed to be by a citizen

301
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
That had

302
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
The same genetic makeup

303
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
August final map

304
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,159
It was the last map submitted just before the deadline

305
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:49,535
And the citizens District 5 map is packed exactly the same way the legislators disc

306
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Big 5 map

307
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,607
Danos this can't be a coincidence

308
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,911
Whoever submitted this map

309
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,703
Has to be a partisan plant

310
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
So the lawyers that Dan had been working for

311
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
They find the name of

312
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
The guy who submitted this

313
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Vine

314
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
And it's a guy named Alejandro Perez

315
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,247
Next up we have Alejandro Posada

316
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
First off I just like

317
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
Got map has his name on it

318
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,159
He also testified at a public meeting

319
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
But no one had ever heard of

320
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,047
Yeah he's not a known Republican operative in Florida so

321
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Who is he

322
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
You are a college

323
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
This map was submitted by an FSU undergraduate

324
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Little if any

325
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
Map making

326
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Experience

327
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
But instead of this being

328
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,455
Gotcha moment like we just found the partisan who drew the maps

329
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
That undergrad Alejandro

330
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Posadas says

331
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,087
Wait what are you guys talking about

332
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
I did go to a hearing

333
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,671
But I never submitted a map

334
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,719
I don't know maybe someone just

335
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,023
Like stole my name off the sign in sheet and see

336
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Submitted a map in my name

337
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,375
So they can't prove Alejandro's map came from a consult

338
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
Until one day a lawyer working on this

339
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Casey guy name

340
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
It's called a nap and he says

341
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
Hidan swing by I have something for

342
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
Number for tanning over

343
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
A flash drive

344
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
The shape of a silver bullet

345
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
This flash drive is full of secret map

346
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,527
Strong by Republican Consulting

347
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
Stan's been trying to get his hands on these

348
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
4 years

349
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,159
It was a court order that forced the Republicans to hand them over

350
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
But now that he does have them it's just

351
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,023
4 weeks before the trial is set to start

352
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
Trying to get one of these puzzles and

353
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
Do it with a

354
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
Clock ticking away

355
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Dan and Shay

356
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
A team of graduate

357
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
But students

358
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,031
Start combing through this cash of C

359
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
Secretly drawn partisan maps that they

360
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:38,847
Just gotten

361
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,151
And a zero in on one map

362
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
But has a very interesting name

363
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
It was called

364
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Perfect pieces

365
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Name these

366
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
Imperfect

367
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,207
Next time we're totally not reading the process

368
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,279
Conversion for

369
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,351
Perfect pieces was a little too perfect

370
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,447
District 5 was drawn exactly the same in perfect

371
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
Pieces the party center on map

372
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,823
In Alejandro posadas map and in the final Legend

373

Just latest mat

374
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
Dan found the match

375
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,687
These Maps where milk was spilled in a

376
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,711
Exactly the same

377
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,527
Now they are ready for trial

378
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
First case on the docket today is the

379
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
Mapmakers behind perfect

380
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Pieces are unmasked

381
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
During match

382
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,839
Republican Consultants testify that they drafts of Florida Congressional Maps they were later submitted to the ledges

383
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
Slate Run to the name Alex Posada

384
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
But the Consultants say

385
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,191
We don't know how Alex

386
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
What's the time in Qatar

387
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,799
Here's one of them Rich Heffley being questioned at the trial

388
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
Can you explain to me

389
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
That

390
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
First of all you're not my districts

391
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:56,159
Second mall I won't say what my mom taught me about assuming things but

392
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
I will tell you

393
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,767
The I don't know Mister Posada I didn't have anything to do with submitting Maps

394
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
I don't know how they got the Bubba

395
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,607
Republican Consultants say

396
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
We don't know how people got our mats

397
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,751
And even if we did have them off our mats weren't drawn with partisan intent

398
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,103
But then a piece of evidence emerges to prove intent

399
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
Where is pretty damning

400
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,943
We'll tell you what Dan sound coming up after the

401
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479

People often think of nobodies are too conservative

406

Too complex or only for retirees

407
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
But annuity

408
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023

Miss this report to the lawyers that shows the match were designed to gain the Voting Rights Act

422
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,535
It was a really sneaky way to hide partisanship under the guise of being fair to people of color

423
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
They had

424
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
Pat Moore black voters into

425
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
District 5 then it had ever

426
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
More than was needed to elect a

427
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Color

428
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
Enough that it would likely hit this

429
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
Pacific Legal fresh

430
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,615
Hitting that threshold meant the district was

431
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
Protected by the Voting Rights

432
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
So if Democrats ever wanted to unpack

433
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
District 5 it would be

434
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,039
Very very hard

435
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,623
And when the judge realizes along with everyone else what has happened

436
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,183
He issues a scathing ruling

437
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,791
He says Florida Republicans have made a mockery of the democratic process

438
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,351
Orders them to redraw the lines

439
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
End

440
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,679
Many years and lawsuits later Florida

441
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Finally does

442
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,495
But the Florida legislature

443
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
Couldn't agree on the maps

444
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
So in the end

445
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
The courts true

446
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,407
Just in time for the 2016 election

447
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,735
In these new maps District 5

448
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,295
And the claim that unpack

449
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
Packing District 5 would hurt miner

450
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Did not pass

451
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
In fact

452
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
When voters from District 5 were now spread out across several districts

453
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
Free of those districts elected

454
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
People of color

455
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,143
Once the maps are redrawn politicians actually start to have to

456
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
To fight for their seeds

457
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,983
And in a lot of cases their positions

458
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Start to change

459
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
Now politicians can't just politic to their base

460
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,615
They have to appeal to everyone

461
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:28,991
Politicians start shifting positions on issues like the minimum wage Health Care guns

462
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
Like this one state senator

463
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,855
She previously had a 100% rating with

464
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
With the NRA

465
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,207
And after the lights GIF she starts saying things

466
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,535
I do not support having guns on campus I do not have any

467
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,559
It support having guns

468
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,375
Airport I don't have to having guns

469
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,679
In school zones I don't support

470
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Those things

471
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,103
So tens of millions of dollars and four years of litigation later does it was it worth it

472
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
Yeah I mean it's it's

473
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,687
It's a good question I think

474
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
You know in the end

475
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,295
It was definitely worth it not

476
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
Because it elected Democrats

477
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:09,183
Or minorities but because these Maps were objects

478
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
Wayfair

479
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,767
It does open up the process

480
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
If only under threat of

481
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
Subpoena

482
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
This thing that Florida did

483
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
Outline partisan gerrymandering

484
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,287
The Supreme Court might do it to for the rest of the

485
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,639
The court just heard two cases about it and it's going to issue rulings later this month

486
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:29,919
Talk to at

487
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Kind of people in Florida

488
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,479
Lawyers politicians

489
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,039
Consultants Democrat and Republican

490
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
And a lot of them said

491
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Some shady partisan

492
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
And stuff did go on a

493
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
District 5

494
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
But

495
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,767
Remember why District 5 with created and gerrymandered

496
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
In the first place

497
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,119
So that people of color had a fair shot at getting elected

498
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
Gerrymandering

499
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Fix that

500
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
And as long as race

501
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
Send political affiliation state

502
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,311
Tangled as they are in the sky

503
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Country

504
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,151
It will be really hard to figure out how to draw the line

505
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
