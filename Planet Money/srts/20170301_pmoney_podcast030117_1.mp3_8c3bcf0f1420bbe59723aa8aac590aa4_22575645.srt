When Lisa signed up for match.com she was at this point in her dating life where

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,576
She is ready to try something new

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
Not online dating

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,136
Meet people online

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
But just

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,232
Generally she been feeling like she needed a whole new

11
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,352
I had to be kind of more aggressive about it I had to be more diligent

12
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,912
And not just

13
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,192
And I had beef

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
Lisa was 31 years old she just moved back to New York

15
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,872
And she's basically spent her twenties in a series of long-term relations

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,272
I kind of decided at 31 that I didn't have that luxury anymore I couldn't do that anymore until I was much more

17
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
Efficient

18
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,648
He said you may recognize her very own Lisa

19
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:06,048
The Chow a report of here at Planet money but this was back in 2008 long before she joined us here and none of us

20
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,096
Actually knew this story until just yes

21
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,912
And so I started going on dates

22
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
And

23
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,032
And it did get a little bit overwhelming and so I did

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,824
Do something

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
I did make

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,128
An Excel file

27
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
And I started

28
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
Just writing down their names

29
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
You have a spread

30
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,344
And I kind of created these different columns actually

31
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,672
1 2 3 4 5 6 column

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,768
Lisa needed the spreadsheet because in a year-and-a-half

33
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,328
Lisa Chow went on 58th

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
50 First Dates

35
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
22 of the 50 I want on side

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288

37
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
It was so much fun

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,152
Really yeah I really loved every night you didn't smell so funny

39
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
I was actually really

40
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
Pleasantly surprised meaning

41
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,272
The guys were really great

42
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
There's some really nice guys

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,672
That is literally the first time I've ever heard that from a woman

44
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:09,792

I had no idea she went on 50 First Dates and she never once felt sad

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,152
Or stress

52
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,432
Order more lives

53
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,040
She just with efficient and rational she's thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience

54
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:36,928
Here's what you did she went on 50 days and each time she went home after the date and she would record

55
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Months

56
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,768
Year of time location name

57
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,304
And one memorable day

58
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,120
Okay so I have

59
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Pothead

60
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Touchy

61
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
Boring

62
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
This guy

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
Had for gym memberships

64
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,920
What is the one that I'd say that I love

65
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
Here for this person

66
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
You have

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
Bobs his head a bit too much

68
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,088
Socially inept to Russian

69
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
Biscuit Head

70
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,416
Wei West Coast but super

71
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
Cute dude

72
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
At the time Lisa it had lots of friends who are also dating online and they would all complain all the time about you

73
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,960
No I wrote Five Guys and only one of them wrote me back

74
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
When I was doing online dating I never wrote

75
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,128
People emails NEP some people might call that a cop-out but I just said I'm going to lower my Trans Am

76
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,688
And purely just

77
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,248
Wink and if they're really interested though right back

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,552
I remember actually I'd be sitting

79
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,880
Like watching some HBO show

80
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Sitting back up

81
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
Quick getaway

82
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Wink

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,512
Rake it up

84
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
Not even thinking twice about it

85
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,120
The date needed to happen very soon after first Contact

86
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,728
Suicide didn't want to build up some idea of the guy before meeting him and then have an opportunity

87
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,752
To be disappointed

88
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,336
Similarly no dates on Friday or Saturday nights

89
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
She told me

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
It's depressing to come home after a bad date on a weekend so she

91
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
You just never let that happen

92
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,576
And if Lisa went on a third date with someone she would always take them to a social Gathering

93
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
That included some casual friends of hers

94
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
That way she could observe them in a social

95
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,024
In other words we took something that's normally

96
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
Sirius and Squishy

97
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,351
Human attraction

98
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
And she

99
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Trying to

100
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,215
Strip it of all of the messy emotions

101
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
I really think that's

102
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
What made her so success

103
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,127
She made this thing that most people find so stressful and

104
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
Tedious that

105
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,967
Sucks your time and self confidence and Hope

106
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,503
And she made that

107
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,831
Fun and she did it using data and statistics and

108
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,207
True economics reporter Lisa Chow she applied the principles of economics to her love life

109
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
And it worked

110
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
There was one github

111
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
That was like almost like 45 number 45 right

112
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,447
We we were kind of dating we're seeing each other about 6

113
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
And I

114
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,263
Just at one point just decided

115
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Okay

116
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
This is not going to work

117
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,871
So I can I cut the cord

118
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,431
And then I and I thought like

119
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,223
Diamonique mistake

120
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
Like you know we did have so many

121
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
Kind of things in common

122
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,439
And then the next week I went on a date with Kevin and instantly I knew I didn't make a mistake

123
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,511
You know and I was thinking all those times that I had

124
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
If I had stayed with that guy

125
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
And I would have had that out

126
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Opportunity

127
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Like the Kevin

128
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,703
Right into it just became very it kind of

129
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,103
Crystallized right there like okay that's what an opportunity cost Feels Like Rain is like when you stay with that guy

130
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Kind of feeling iffy about

131
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
And you're missing out on

132
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
You know Kevin

133
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:54,815

And Kevin have a beautiful toddler named Isaac

137
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,055
And Lisa story reminded us of something that we

138
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
Wonder about during our

139
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,919

140
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,759

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Can you take it all the way

143
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,415

00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439

We had an opportunity to test this the other day because one of our favorite economist

159
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
Was in New York

160
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
Promoting a new book Tim Hart

161
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
It's in Hartford is a

162
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,951
Great guy he used to work as an economist for Shell in the World Bank

163
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,535
And then she went into the sort of thing we do explanatory journalism

164
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
He wrote a book called the undercover economist

165
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
In a column in the financial times and

166
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:39,519
I imagine it's somewhat hard to come up with a topic every week in the financial times has he had this great idea this

167
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
This jokey idea

168
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
I will do

169
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
A deer economist

00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Advice column

171
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663

And sex advice

173

For the Heartbreak

174
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
In many ways

175
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,343
Love seems to be totally divorced from economics

176
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
But then you realize well

177
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
The stakes are high

178
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
This is something that matters to us

179
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,023
We dealing with scarcity

180
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
I miss you

181
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
Dating one person

182
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,983
At the very least you don't have as much time to date another person then you may well find that you can only date one person

183
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
Strange happened

184
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,127
When he started to do this, I need a first date with this character he was playing

185
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,711
Real people started writing with real problems

186
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
Kim started think you know

187
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Economics

188
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599
Economics really does have something to offer these p

189
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,903
It's simultaneously

190
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,487
Completely useless and irrelevant and somehow in some

191
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
Brilliant

192
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,071
Hidden genius way keeps

193
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
Producing

194
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,447
Insights that are not necessarily obvious from the normal way that we think

195
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,079
We knew Tim was coming in and we asked all of you to send us your questions

196
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,663
About love and sex and whatever else you wanted to ask him about

197
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,735
We got some of you on the phone with him so you could ask him

198
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,783
Directly for his economic advice

199
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,111
Are there are you there yeah great High

200
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Hi

201
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,719
So we have Tim Harford here do you want to introduce yourself to him

202
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
Okay

203
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,375
My name is Arthur I live in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania I'm a senior in high school

204
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
I'm pleased to meet you off of how I want him

205
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
Pleased to meet you

206
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
What's your question for The Economist

207
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
Alright so my question is

208
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,383
I'm and I'm a senior in highschool and I've never

209
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
Been on a date

210
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
Should I be worried about this

211
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,575
Arthur can I just ask what is it about not having been on a date that makes you

212
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
Worried what makes you think you should be worried

213
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
I know it just seems the

214
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
Everyone else

215
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
Yeah I like but not everyone else to lots of people around me

216
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
It all in

217
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
You are the prom coming up and

218
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
I'm clueless about that so

219
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
Cuz it's a little bit stressful

220
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
I think you are

221
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,407
The victim of what behavioral Economist call

222
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
Hyperbolic discount

223
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,503
More simply

224
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
You taking a very short-term Prospect

225
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,903
So you really miss the first 10% of your

226
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
He'll possible dating experience

227
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
And let's be honest

228
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
It's not the best 10% is it

229
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
Dating when you're a teenager

230
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,631
It's not that great

231
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,959
They're all kinds of inconveniences you have your own place

232
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,495
What you doing

233
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
Italy case economist

234
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:26,943
Council that you shouldn't worry about some costs that you can go back in time and have a date when you're 15 anyway

235
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
So don't worry about that

236
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:34,367
I would just be inclined to crack on with things are you planning to go to college

237
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:39,231
Yeah well experience suggests is going to get a lot more exciting from then on in don't worry

238
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Okay

239
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Are you going to ask somebody to prom

240
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
I

241
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
Haven't really thought about that

242
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
You know I got to wish

243
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
Probably nothing

244
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:57,151
I think a lot of people have that feeling I could give you a piece of advice specifically about the prom if you're interested

245
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
So the Great

246
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:05,087
Behavioral Economist stroke psychologist Daniel, when he won the Nobel prize in economics

247
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,135
Even though he's not an economist that tile Goodyear

248
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,719
He talks about something called loss aversion

249
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
This is a a

250
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,607
The discovery that was one of the first discoveries made in behavioral economics

251
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,703
Unlost version is pretty disproportionate anxiety

252
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,263
About stuff that doesn't matter very much

253
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,847
So for instance if you lose $5

254
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,711
You feel really bad about the $5 you've lost your cousin yourself your

255
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
Going to it again and again

256
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,807
If on the other hand you find $5

257
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,415
You got a great fight box I need forgotten about it really quickly

258
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
Salad think about Promenade

259
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
One of the games of

260
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Accommodate

261
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
That goes well

262
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
Versus

263
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
The losses

264
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
From

265
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
I come back but doesn't go well or you lost someone to the prom

266
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
And they say no

267
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,127
Well actually you are going to have a prom date anyway if you didn't ask

268
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,455
So the the cost of asking somebody and being refused is

269
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Actually really

270
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
Quite small it doesn't feel good

271
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
But it's no big deal

272
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:14,719
Where are you never had that before so it goes well this could be the start of something big for you

273
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
So

274
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,327
Remember loss aversion when you are

275
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:25,727
Weighing up these two choices I can't tell you what to do but I can tell you you'll probably taking the downside risk to

276
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
You seriously

277
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
I'm not thinking

278
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,079
Enough about the potential outside

279
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,687
Just don't actually use the words loss of virtue

280
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
How do you feel about that advice

281
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
I feel great

282
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
That makes you feel better really good

283
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:46,719
Economics spreads happiness

284
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,791
Arthur thank you so much thank you very much

285
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,119
Write one problem solved if you're just tuning in

286
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
Dear Economist to taking advice for the lovelorn

287
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Next up

288
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
Russellton news

289
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
Yes I can

290
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,079
This is Robert Smith the co-host were here with him

291
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
Anna Russell this attempt

292
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Other time

293
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,479
Just introduce yourself to our Economist and tell him your question

294
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,343
Well you been I guess my question is kind of long my name is Russell and

295
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
I'm a polyamorous

296
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
I'm married

297
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
Girls have to close

298
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,511
Other loving partner should I share my life with an intern

299
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
She also has

300
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,583
Other partners of her own

301
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
And in fact

302
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
We live with one of her boyfriends

303
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,495
The concept of abundance

304
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,311
And love is abundance and you can share it with whomever you want

305
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
Where is monogamy

306
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
Concentrates on scarcity

307
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
So I just

308
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,015
Curious to hear The Economist often the idea of scarcity in abundance in love and then what economic benefits

309
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,367
Terrorized from society thinking abundantly About Love in This Way

310
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
The Russell

311
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:54,559
Economics is often described as the study of scarce resources so in a way you would think that I'm kind of messed with the wrong

312
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Wrong

313
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
Person to analyze

314
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:01,727
The situation of abundance that you find yourself in onshore a lot of listening

315
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
Contemplating about abundance right now

316
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
That what I would say is

317
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
That love

318
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,199
May be boundless and abundant but time isn't

319
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
Time is finite

320
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,087
So the challenge that I'm sure you're well aware of having to manage is

321
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,671
Splitting your time between your multiple partners

322
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:24,767
Another reason actually an economic theory that is related to this

323
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,839
It was about it by Rebecca Nobel Prize winner in economics

324
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
And he

325
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
Developed an idea of

326
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
How

327
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
Many children

328
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
You might want to have

329
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
Desert Rain up here

330
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,383
Because each additional child that you have

331
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
Is going to divide your time

332
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
And your attention

333
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
Are you going to have to cram them into a smaller house they can have to share a room so you might have to move into suburbs somewhere

334
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
A cheaper further away from where the job is

335
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,487
You can't afford to spend so much time with them

336
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,303
I'm so in Becca's Theory there is trade-off

337
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
Between the quantity of children

338
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
And the quality of children

339
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
And I I would imagine you face the same trade-off you have to decide what we up to Optimal number of committed

340
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
You say that love is abundant

341
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Unconditional transparent

342
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
Foxcu

343
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,271
Behavior is not totally consistent with us

344
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,111
Because you ugly have I think what three committed promise your wife has

345
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
If you committed peronnas

346
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Why not

347
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,279
5 billion / 7 billion people on the planet

348
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
Yynot love all of them

349
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,679
What is the Russell have you have you hit your limit

350
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,847
Actually the answer is yes because what I discovered this was trying to be able to have a say more than three Partners was absolutely

351
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
At least for my own relationship

352
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,551
And I I constantly have to be able to balance my time and be able to schedule and coordinate my time with my partners

353
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,367
So that I can be able to have a meaningful relationship

354
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:59,487
Otherwise it just kind of degrades over time and it's not something that's worthwhile I mean

355
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,071
Russell this is something I love about economics so I know

356
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
Very little about polyamory

357
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,935
This is a fairy that Gary Becker developed

358
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
Almost half a century ago

359
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:14,847
And yet it delivers a result that you find persuasive thank you

360
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
Okay well thanks so much

361
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Thanks Russell

362
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:24,063
Our next guest him we we we brought in in person because

363
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,879
She's got some things to show you I introduce yourself

364
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:31,231
My name is Andrea celenza and I'm the host of dating podcast called yoy

365
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Hundred

366
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,559
Very nice to meet you so what can I do for you

367
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,375
How many dating apps should I be on to do

368
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
To find a match

369
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,727
It stopped to get very

370
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Difficult

371
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:49,407
When you have too many to spend any amount of time on any one of these things your question

372
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
Seems to me

373
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,759
Implies that you will you're trying to find the perfect

374
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Match

375
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,879
Because that only if you were trying to find the perfect match would you expanded have

376
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,951
That we don't want to happen in a second. Going to set up Anna.

377
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,511
But if you're just trying to convey John goodenough

378
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,047
You probably want to focus

379
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,863
But tell me what do you see in these times

380
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,775
I think I'm trying to optimize here is if I'm going to spend time and I'm going to set aside a Thursday we're going to come up with the

381
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
What time we're going to find a place I'm going to get on the train

382
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,687
I'm going to sit down for a drink and have to meet this person I want to make it

383
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,991
Worth my time I want to make sure that I'm

384
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
I don't want to waste a Thursday

385
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,391
Discuss results here is no man has cash results yesterday

386
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
What you really need to be doing

387
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
Is

388
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,303
Finding out a way to have a date like experience

389
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,863
Before you have

390
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
The date

391
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Because the date like experience is

392
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:49,567
What you really don't need to look at a thousand guys online what you need to do is have

393
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
5

394
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
Almost died

395
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,711
To save on the actual date which is the release cats Resort

396
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,831
So what you need to do is you need to have some app that lets you

397
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
Say look at

398
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:07,231
Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum together and talk about them

399
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:12,351
Watch a film together online and talk about the film online

400
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,655
I'm actually very quickly find out

401
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,423
Then

402
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
Whether that's a match or not

403
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
Is there anything that can like

404
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
Simulate

405
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
A Daily Star a real conversation

406
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,407
Hypothetically I can ask any guy

407
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,735
Hey before we decide to go to the spa in Williamsburg

408
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,783
Thursday how about instead we

409
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,575
Height for 15 minutes

410
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,903
I think I would know what I need to know from that Skype conversation but

411
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,951
It's an ask that no one else is asking

412
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,743
For no one else

413
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,559
NASCAR level commitment you're kind of not allowed to ask

414
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,655
I I think that you should stick to this and you know why I think you should stick to this

415
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
Because my time is incredibly valuable

416
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
And I'm so busy

417
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
Yeah you know that but

418
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
Here's the thing

419
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,103
Because wouldn't it be interesting

420
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
Find

421
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,687
The guys who would actually

422
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
Exceed

423
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Python requests

424
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,647
This is actually we've already discussed you know shortage of guys out that has lots and lots of guys out there

425
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
The question is trying to find the right one

426
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,791
And so you and your factory setting up what

427
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,375
A Michael Spence Nobel Prize for economics which cool to screen

428
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,423
Do you say what I want from you

429
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Happy today

430
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
All I want from you

431
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
15 minutes

432
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
All the insects

433
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Talk

434
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,247
Thank you so much for having me and I feel like I learned upon I'm so excited to annoy all of Brooklyn with my Skype

435
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:38,623
Request an economics making people's lives better at tell me how this guy works out

436
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,839
This is how we left the show in 2014

437
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,143
Fun Way To Think about economic

438
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447
In our real life I did not think

439
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,263
Did anyone would take the advice seriously

440
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,823
But Andreas Lindsay the last voice you heard

441
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
She did take it serious

442
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
Shortly after the show aired

443
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
Andrea started

444
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
To date

445
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
Via Skype

446
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:09,087
Any neuron podcast why oh why she told the whole story of how it worked out

447
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
Let's hear little clip

448
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
Hey hi

449
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
How to do

450
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,935
Ideas

451
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,799
No it's an economist but it was my idea to take dating advice

452
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
I kind of

453
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,151
So that's my

454
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
I became my boyfriend

455
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:38,271
The first conversation we ever had was recorded for the show

456
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,575
I even put sentimental music under it

457
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
That's how you know I like them

458
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,951
I feel like I owe you a drink

459
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,255
Can I take you out in real life

460
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,815
Really

461
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,239
Sounds like kind of just like maybe Mom

462
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,263
Not actually

463
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
Our first real date was to a dive bar

464
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
I went home with him

465
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,711
And that night he asked would bother me if he kept a light on

466
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
It's about to finish this book

467
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,087
Remember falling asleep to the sound of a page-turning

468
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,647
Knowing that this was unlike anything

469
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,208
Indian Mike moved in together

470
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
They plan to whole life too

471
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,560
And then after a couple of happy years

472
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
The relationship

473
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Ended suddenly

474
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,704
And interpret Tim Harford back on her show on yoy

475
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728

476
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,544

Okay yeah

479
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
That name rings a bell

480
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
Yeah

481
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432

482
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,760
All I remember all that crazy Planet Money

483
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,320
Terrible terrible advice I gave her

484
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
I meant to just to listen to it all.

485
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
I feel like I have

486
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,304
At least indirectly broken your heart and for these I can only

487
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Apologize

488
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
