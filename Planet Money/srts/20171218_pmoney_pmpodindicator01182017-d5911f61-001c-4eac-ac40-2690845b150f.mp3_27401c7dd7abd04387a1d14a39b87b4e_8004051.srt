I'm Stacey Vanek

27
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,296

Full Walden Pond

31
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,000
Yesterday the Federal Communications

32
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,024
Mission the FCC

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,328
Voted to end the policy called net

34
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,096
Neutrality

35
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,936
The turbo tie the item is adopted with editorial privileges Grant

36
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,544
Net neutrality is essentially a rule that internet providers have to treat all web traffic

37
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,592
So princess I can't decide

38
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
To block a website or to make some content

39
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
Fast

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
And the reason that neutrality such a controversial issue

41
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
Boils down to

42
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
Single number

43
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
And that number

44
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,392
As luck would have it is today's indicator

45
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
58%

46
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488

00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,840
One option for Broadband in

50
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
And card if you know some

51
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
Something about this

52
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,936
Oh hell yes I do

53
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,520
Send see what happened was it at the end of 24

54
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
Teen

55
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
I become Fed Up

56
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
With my internet and

57
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:52,896
Cable service

58
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
Okay

59
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
It just wasn't working very well

60
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
On top of that

61
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,064
The amount that I was paying each month had gone up

62
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
And nobody

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
Told me

64
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
And I called to complain innocence

65
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184
See they said that they

66
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
What about it

67
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
When I started investigating what my options

68
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
Ensworth

69
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072

Internet

71
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,912
How it turned out that actually Time Warner really was

72
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
The only

73
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Realized

74
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
Yeah yeah

75
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
I was pissed off and it said see what I decided what

76
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
Who is it I was to

77
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
Not just cut the cord on cable but I was just

78
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
Stop getting any

79
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,760

Bus and ice

83
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
Said screw it

84
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,184
I'm just going to go a few months without the internet

85
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,024
And without cable and see how that goes and a few more months finally became

86
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
A whole year so

87
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328

Deeply rooted connection to

93
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,688
Part of your cable situation also the cable situation of most of the people in this country

If you live in New York and did both of us do this in the city where you know their likes

101
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,616
17 different Chinese restaurants in for black

102
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
Radius so how is it possible that you would have

103
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
One good option

104
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Denver high speed

105
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,272
I don't know I wish there was somebody we could ask

106
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808
In fact there is

107
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:39,136
I put this question to Shane Greenstein he teaches at Harvard

108
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
Oh that is it

109
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,024
Wonderful question okay tell me

110
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
She says the story starts back in the

111
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
There was this new thing called

112
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Cable TV

113
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
No more rabbit ears much better

114
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Picture but there was a problem

115
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
It cost a lot of money

116
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
Dig up the ground

117
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
And putting cable lines to every single house

118
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Initially

119
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,408
When cable was first being built out at me

120
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:05,248
Was not affordable to have more than one firm because it wasn't height a cup

121
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,808
What city is really wanted cable to be available

122
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
The people they wanted the cable companies to invest in putting the lines in

123
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,952
But the cable companies at that time where small didn't have it

124
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
So they said okay

125
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,631
We will put in this expensive new infrastructure will take this risk and make cable available to everyone in the city

126
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,167
But we want something

127
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,215
We want you to promise US that

128
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
If we spend all this money

129
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
To put in these cable lines

130
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,871
We are going to be the only ones running cable to the houses in your city

131
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
They'd get a little bit of a

132
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
Monopoly like a little mini Monopoly

133
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,527
Uvalde overtime into that

134
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,087
Over the next few decades to things happen

135
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
When was

136
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,951
The internet and it turned out the best way to get fast internet

137
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,975
People's houses was

138
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
/ cable line

139
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:53,631
Any other thing that happened was that those many monopolies who owns the cable lines merged and

140
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
Merged again and became

141
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
That's so many Monopoly

142
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
This caused some problems

143
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,311
Shane Greenstein with a paper about one of the most

144
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Famous exam

145
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,639
Samples where Comcast Cable company

146
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,943
Started demanding payments from Netflix

147
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,783
Saying hey Netflix if you want to be available to Comcast customers

148
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Taipei

149
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
Netflix said no way

150
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,439
And suddenly Comcast customers who tried to watch movies on Netflix

151
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
We're just ended

152
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
World

153
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Buffering

154
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,071
Worth noting Comcast is a part owner of

155
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Flu a direct competitor tonight

156
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,703
Greenside said If This Were a regular competitive market

157
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
What Comcast did but not be such a big

158
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
I mean in that case of Comcast

159
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,823
My Netflix

160
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,615
I could just switch to another internet for

161
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
Right if there were competitive market with full transparency than users would punish

162
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,855
The providers you don't behave well

163
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,439
Other countries have solved this problem by breaking up the mini Monopoly

164
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,255
So people can choose from lots of different internet provider

165
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:57,119
In the US the most Americans do not have a choice about where they get their broadband

166
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
And so a few years back the Obama Administration

167
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Put net neutrality in

168
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
And it said cable companies

169
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
How to treat all internet traffic

170
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,663
Soap for example Comcast is not allowed to favor Hulu over

171
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
It's like a bypass or something I guess it's a regulatory mechanism to try to limit the distortions of have

172
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
Limited options

173
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
That's exactly what it isn't it

174
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
It's found it on a

175
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:27,839
Pretty long history in the United States of doing this and things like railroads electricity and telephones

176
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
Yesterday the FCC voted to end net neutrality

177
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,471
Internet providers will not be officially obligated

178
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
Treat all website

179
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
Now Shane says things aren't likely to ratify

180
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Will you change overnight

181
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
Lots of people are going to be challenging this in

182
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Quartz

183
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,943
But still Comcast

184
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,527
Could potentially put Netflix into the buffering Zone once again

185
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,879
And if they do and Comcast is your only high-speed internet option

186
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
There will not be that much you can do about it

187
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Except maybe get rid of

188
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
Internet altogether

189
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
Speaking of which Cardiff Garcia

190
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
Yes

191
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,887
You have to tell us what it was like to have no internet

192
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
I required a few adjustments

193
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,239
I did read more books and that was nice

194
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
On the other hand I also

195
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
Watch Netflix shows

196
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,383
Was on my iPhone holding it like

197
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
4in from my face

198
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,711
With the lights off like

199
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
A huge weird

200
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
And by the end of the year ride

201
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
Just sort of had enough

202
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
So

203
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,903
Shamefully I went crawling back

204
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
You got internet I got internet I got cable

205
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,351
Hell I even got showtimes Ronan a picture

206
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
Overcompensated for what I've been missing

207
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
The prior-year

208
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
That's how that story

209
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,895
I think they learned their lesson card I think I think you're at least what I learned mine
