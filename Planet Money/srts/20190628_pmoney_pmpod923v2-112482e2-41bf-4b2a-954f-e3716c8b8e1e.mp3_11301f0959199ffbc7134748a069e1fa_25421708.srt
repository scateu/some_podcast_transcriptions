1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,584
Alright padlock is gone and it is recording

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,424
This recording is the first time that Caitlin McCollum talk to end

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:11,008
He was teaching Spanish at a public high school in Tennessee

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:14,592
Most of our students came from a relatively low income rural

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:18,688
I told them today that I had an interview with you all and

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,576
Atkins many of them as they left plastic good luck really hope things

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,904
You know are putting the motion from this interview

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672
Back in college

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,488
Caitlin had made this deal with the United States

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
Education

11
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
She promised

12
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,096
Teach at a low income school for four years

13
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
Heat exchange

14
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,704
Madea we gave her $16,000 for college

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,752
Free and clear not alone

16
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,592
After three years of doing exactly what she said she would

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,384
She got the letter

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,992
I remember going out to the mailbox I even opened it up at the mailbox

19
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,832
Came inside and

20
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,392
Sheer Panic just sat in

21
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,208
The letter was about the deal Caitlin had made with

22
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
With the Department of

23
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
Education

24
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
Yes

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
She had spent

26
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,608
3 years teaching exactly where she said she would

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
But

28
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,984
There was a problem with Caitlin's paperwork saying that she was teaching

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Where she said she

30
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,080
The government had allegedly received that paperwork

31
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
2

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
Or maybe three days late

33
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,968
Seemingly not a big problem after all they got

34
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,736
The paperwork

35
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
Except

36
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
Has the letter explained

37
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,576
In this case

38
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
The punishment

39
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,928
Was it the entire deal was now torn up and can't

40
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,208
Kaitlyn

41
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:37,024
Was going to have to repay the Department of Education

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
Every penny

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
They gave her

44
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Back in college

45
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,424
I remember my husband coming in the house and I was sobbing

46
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,240
I'm just absolutely sobbing and

47
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
We actually

48
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,824
I just found out

49
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,384
That I was pregnant with our first child

50
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
And then

51
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
To be hit with this

52
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,784
I feel like it's so very unjust and unethical

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
But there's nothing that I can do because I'm such a small fish against the federal government

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,256
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Kenny Malone

55
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
For more than a year

56
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,144
Two of our colleagues at NPR have been investigating stories like Caitlin McCollum

57
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
And discovered

58
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,984
Thousands of teachers across the country

59
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Made a deal to help

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
Struggling schools

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
Did what they promise

62
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
And we're ultimately rewarded

63
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,664
With millions of dollars

64
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
Today on the show

65
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,016
The story of how the Department of Education

66
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
Turned into what many teachers felt

67
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Was a ruthless

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,368
Predatory loan

80
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
In the Kabuki tradition in Japan

81
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Minstrel show

82
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
In Vaudeville

83
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,560
But one TV show made it mainstream

84
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Now

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
We break down drags current Renaissance

86
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
Check out NPR's it's been a minute

87
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,312
Now

88
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,152
So how does it how does this begin you like a tip from a

89
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
I don't know somebody in a trench coat would it How does it go

90
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,904
It's trench coat this is Chris Arnold

91
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,744
He's an investigative reporter at NPR who covers consumer protection

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
Yes oats I get this tap and it makes me like look at their stuff worth digging into around the Department of Education and

93
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,240
Things that are going on in and that gets me to look at this lawsuit wasn't digging through

94
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
I see this mention of this program called

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
The teach Grant Pro

96
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
Did you ever heard of this before no not at all I'm reading this lawsuit same time Chris is

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,576
Cory Turner NPR also worked on this invest

98
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,392
And I'm the education reporter

99
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,208
And I do the same thing I stumbled across

100
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
Teach Grant

101
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
Never heard of it

102
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,095
The teach grant program started more than a decade

103
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,495
Will the members in the aisles please take their conversations the back of the chamber

104
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,055
Teach was just a small part of this bill

105
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
Call the college cost reduction Act

106
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Mm

107
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
It was sponsored

108
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
By Democratic representative

109
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
George Miller

110
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
For students in college

111
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
And want to teach

112
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Did they make a commitment to teach

113
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
In difficult Public Schools

114
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:47,231
We will provide $4,000 a year in tuition assistance while they're in school

115
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,839
So prospective teachers could get up to $16,000 free and clear

116
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,911
If they went and taught at a low income School

117
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
After the garage

118
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,543
But if for some reason somebody took that money and then didn't go and

119
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
And teach like

120
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Promise

121
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
There was this provision

122
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
Allowed the government to say

123
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
Hey listen

124
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
You got to give us that money

125
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
Yeah that Graham is going to become alone

126
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
Yeah and that's totally reasonable right I mean cuz if

127
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,439
Someone said yes sure Mana I'll become a teacher and then they

128
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
Go backpacking what is the teacher in your Universe from Fast Times at Ridgemont High

129
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:29,983
Do you like a Fast Times at Ridgemont High type guy looks like you

130
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
MMA just go screw off

131
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,335
Like of course the government's going to want his money back

132
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,151
The Corey and Kris after reporting out that

133
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
Encrypted trench Cody message

134
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
It started to hear that this nuclear option

135
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,319
Converting to Grant into a loan

136
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,623
Was being used for the smallest stuff

137
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Paperwork are

138
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Amidst signature

139
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,719
Filing a form a day late

140
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
Sister calling teachers

141
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
Who had this happen

142
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703
David you're using your voice memo recorder right it running right now excellent what are the first teachers they found was a guy named

143
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
David West

144
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
One day David also got

145
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
One of those letters saying

146
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Your paperwork

147
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
What's a couple days late

148
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
Your teach Grant

149
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Is now a teacher

150
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
Loan

151
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Hey

152
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,527
Initially my feeling was surely this is a mistake

153
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Surely this

154
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,087
Can't be that big a deal

155
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
Let me call them up

156
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,951
So we get somebody on the phone and he explains like hey

157
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
I'm teaching where I'm supposed to

158
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Can we just get this cleared up

159
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
And the person is like

160
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
No

161
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
You were two days late

162
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
And technically

163
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
We are now allowed to

164
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
Turn your Grant

165
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Into a loan

166
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
David is like

167
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
White

168
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
I was

169
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
2 days late on paperwork

170
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,687
And essentially the fine for that

171
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
Is that I now owe thousands

172
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,319
Dollars on the job fine I owe you the money

173
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,415
I did the job fair like Loan Sharks I mean I'm surprised nobody showed up to

174
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
Kept my knees with a bat

175
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,791
Again David is not dealing with some shady payday lender

176
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,863
This is a program run by the United States.

177
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
Department of ed

178
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
I could believe it

179
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Score.

180
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,823
You know you got to let me talk to your supervisor blah blah blah you can talk and she said you can talk to who you want

181
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,407
And there's also an appeals process and you can try to appeal this if you want

182
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
But nobody ever wins

183
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
That's exactly what she said to me.

184
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
Wow really yes

185
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,879
I wish I'd recorded that call I remember thinking

186
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
In the moment as soon as he said that

187
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
Does that mean that

188
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,791
The folks in this call center here this so often

189
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
That like

190
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
They just know to say it like

191
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
Sorry buddy

192
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
Don't even bother

193
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:41,311
Yeah it's like we start asking around and we managed to get our hands on this internal report that

194
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,615
The Edge apartment actually done on this teacher

195
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
Which program in in there

196
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,503
What is the answer to our question of what how many teachers

197
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
I've gotten screwed up like this

198
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
It was

199
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
A shocking

200
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415
We have some exclusive reporting from NPR to bring

201
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
Kristen Corey ran a story about

202
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
The internal teacher

203
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
Grant report

204
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
But they've gotten

205
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
1 in

206
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
3 people

207
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
Two lost their grants

208
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:08,959
Said they did meet those teaching requirements or were likely to

209
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,799
The report estimates based on a representative survey that it's upwards

210
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
12000 teachers

211
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
And it's

212
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
Could be a lot more

213
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
The Department of Education wouldn't talk

214
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
Kris and Corey on tape for the store

215
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,319
But they did give this written statement the kind of said

216
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
Oh yeah these numbers do not look good

217
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
We're going to have to look

218
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
That radio story ran

219
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
In March

220
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
F2008

221
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:39,679
You know you do a story you get some feedback on this one it was like Twitter exploded email inboxes exploded

222
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,031
The teacher saying this is exactly what happened to be upset

223
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,103
Sad angry so many people telling us they got hurt

224
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
One of those people

225
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,663
What's Caitlin McCollum

226
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
The teacher that you heard at the very

227
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,735
Beginning of this episode

228
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:59,135
Are you guys can you team up for me get in your color groups for me awesome

229
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,951
Horse teaches at a low income School in Tennessee but

230
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,511
The first time Corey and Kris met her in person

231
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
What's on a student field trip to Washington

232
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Kaitlyn with a shopper

233
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
They met up with is pretty noisy

234
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
Shopping mall food

235
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
For Caitlin explained

236
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,567
Her family had built their life around her teeth grow

237
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,127
Life decisions

238
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,407
Based on

239
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:27,807
What kind of school you had the teacher in because of these grants

240
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:34,207
Every year it seems that we've had a different opportunity or at least option that we could have looked in

241
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Into

242
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Had we not been in this

243
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Predicament

244
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,095
To get a sense of how big these

245
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Life trade-offs work

246
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,447
You just need to talk to Kaitlyn husband AJ who

247
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
Also happened to be on this

248
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:52,639
Yes the way that the grant was structured Caitlin had to teach in AJ and Kaitlyn moved specifically to a place

249
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,199
I swear Caitlin could fulfill her teeth Grant require

250
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
AJ happens to be in the military

251
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Sun after they've already moved

252
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
DJ found out

253
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Where he had qualified

254
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
For Flight School

255
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Which was

256
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,863
I mean obviously dream any anybody that's that has any interest in the military if you qualified to be a pile

257
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,935
That's that's one of those things that it's surreal

258
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
So

259
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,519
We had to look at that and say we we can't leave

260
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:26,175
Kaitlyn and AJ ran the math and unfortunately for AJ it just made economic sense for them to stay where they were

261
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Caitlin could keep teaching

262
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
Keeper grants

263
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
And it wouldn't get buried in debt

264
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
AJ passed on his

265
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,671
Flight school dream so that Caitlyn could keep her promise to the Department of

266
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719
And then of course

267
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
Caitlin got that letter

268
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Asia got home from work one day

269
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
And Caitlin was in tears

270
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,911
She said I don't know what we're going to do and I said I said I'll tell you

271
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
We're not paying it back she said

272
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,543
She said we can't do that and I said I said

273
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,151
I wear a uniform with a flag on my sleeve they're not taking our money

274
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,039
It's wrong and that's that was the culmination of our conversation that night

275
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,623
As you heard earlier Caitlin paperwork was allegedly late by

276
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Two or three days but

277
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
But we didn't mention is that it's not just

278
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,327
The Kaitlyn's entire $16,000 in Grants was suddenly converted to

279
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
You alone

280
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
The way this is enforced is that

281
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,727
They got to go back in time and say oh well actually

282
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
These grants now they were always alone

283
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
End

284
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,127
Clearly you haven't been paying down that loan because

285
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Of course you haven't

286
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,455
Because you had no idea it was a loan

287
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
But that doesn't matter

288
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
Now there's all this backdated interest pile

289
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
And so with interest

290
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
Caitlyn actually now owed around

291
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
$21,000

292
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
And for Caitlin

293
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,791
Who was making around $30,000 a year

294
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,327
That was a sudden

295
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Massive

296
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Financial burden

297
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,447
Sometimes I can go a whole week and not even think about

298
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
This whole issue

299
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:59,615
And then I'll be doing something so mean you'll like washing dishes or taking a shower

300
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
Hit me like a ton of bricks

301
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
Oh my God

302
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
I owe all of that money

303
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
And it still isn't fixed

304
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
And what am I

305
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
Do

306
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
And it's

307
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,671
Like I need a buckling moment of

308
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
Panic All Over Again

309
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
After the break

310
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
How to try and fix a bureaucracy

311
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
At a Starbucks

312
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,703
Support also comes from the United States Postal Service

313
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,543
Everyday innovator companies are Reinventing the way business has

314
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,871
But none of that is possible without the right people

315
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:35,967
People who get packages to over a hundred and fifty million delivery

316
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,063
Affordably and on time with the latest technology and expertise

317
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,415
Who can help you deliver the future of Commerce the United States

318
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Postal Service

319
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,511
See why they deliver more e-commerce packages to home

320
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,047
Almost been anyone in the country

321
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,863
USPS.com future

322
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,447
Hey everyone this is Stacey Vanek Smith

323
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,079
Co-host of the indicator from Planet Money where every day we bring you a short story about the economy

324
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:07,199
This week on the show we check in with the protest in Hong Kong we go ax throwing

325
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,271
And we talked with private firefighters in California

326
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
Check out the indicator from planet

327
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
What Kris and Corey had found was the

328
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,487
Is classic Spirit of the law vs. letter of the law problem

329
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
Technically

330
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
Messed up paperwork or whatever

331
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,631
Violated this deal that thousands of teachers had made

332
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
With the government but

333
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
What really was that deal it was

334
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
To go and teach in a low-income School

335
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,895
Takorean Chris figured if they could just explain this to the right people at the Department of Education

336
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Shirley

337
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
This is the kind of thing that

338
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
So we set up

339
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
This meeting with

340
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Some officials

341
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,367
At the department of Ed

342
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
And we get coffee

343
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
We go to Starbucks

344
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
We sit outside on the

345
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
And Chris is falling down from boss

346
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
Denso

347
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
He's there in his Snappy jacket

348
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
Should I have a snack

349
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,215
You always were the same Snappy jacket a lot of this meeting

350
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Was off the Record but

351
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
Gordon Chris say they can share a general sense of

352
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
They told us sources

353
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,663
About Caitlin McCollum and what kind of a teacher

354
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
This is this is

355
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
Exactly the kind of person you wanted

356
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Going through this program

357
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
And now here she is

358
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Suffering

359
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Because of it

360
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
It did it doesn't make any sense

361
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
It's not

362
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Right

363
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
And so

364
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
Remember you just kept asking why

365
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
Why

366
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Can't you just

367
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,215
Fix-It yeah like like the moment that I I remember like

368
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,031
You know can it just be as simple as

369
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:40,639
If they're teaching in a low-income school they get the grants back cuz who cares about the paperwork

370
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
Right yeah

371
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
And there was like a long pause

372
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,551
And kind of a shake of the head

373
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,647
And it would be like what it was something like for what it what was it would be at Whistling like

374
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
Well that would be nice but

375
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:58,047
You just don't understand how complicated that is not that they necessarily disagreed

376
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
They were telling us

377
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,607
We're not sure that's even

378
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Impossible

379
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,167
So Corey and Kris were like

380
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Okay

381
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
I guess we will just

382
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
Keep doing this story

383
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Especially

384
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,103
Now that they had met the perfect example

385
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
Of how badly this could go

386
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,431
It's been two years of

387
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Torture

388
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
Caitlin McCollum

389
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Is a high school

390
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,855
Again for this story the Department of Education would not do an on tape interview

391
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,439
But on the exact same morning that this story ran

392
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
The Secretary of Education with schedule

393
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,535
To testify in Congress

394
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,839
About something completely unrelated

395
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
To the teach grant program

396
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:39,775
Were you intentionally trolling the Secretary of Education by running a story about Kate

397
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
Caitlin the morning

398
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:47,711
The device was supposed to testify in Capitol Hill about other things I think the honest answer is no but had we

399
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,551
Like actually thought about it we very well may have trolled her

400
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,367
It's a privilege to welcome secretary DeVos

401
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,695
For her first appearance before the education Workforce committee

402
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
Intentional or not it appeared to have worked

403
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,815
At least one house representative

404
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
His staffer Maybe

405
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
Just happened to catch

406
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
The Kaitlyn story on end

407
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,263
NPR it was the ranking Democrat of the house education and labor committee

408
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
Bobby Scott

409
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,639
Weather report this morning of the debacle going on with teachers who are fulfilled

410
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943
In the process of fulfilling their

411
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
Loan forgiveness

412
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Requirements

413
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,111
Technically not a loan forgiveness program but

414
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Close enough Bobby Scott

415
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
How long have you Department known about that

416
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,279
Are you speaking of the teacher grant program

417
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
We are aware of

418
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:38,399
The issues within that program and have

419
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,751
Taken steps to address the issues they're in your new legislation to fix it

420
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
I don't believe so

421
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
DeVos

422
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Acknowledges

423
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
Yeah we got

424
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
That's basically what she say

425
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
We've got

426
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,855
I didn't request you know is that just like a blow off yet or is that no really work committed and if that

427
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
Weiner very idea

428
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:01,695
Department of Education had already announced

429
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
A top-to-bottom review

430
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:03,999
Ava teacher

431
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
Grant program likely

432
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,095
In response to some of Chris and Cory's earlier reporting

433
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
And so they kept going

434
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,703
They worked with the lawyer from the organization public citizen

435
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,263
Could manage to get hundreds of document

436
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,055
It's about the teach grant program

437
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,591
Under the Freedom of Information

438
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,407
Do you learn that the program is better or worse than you thought

439
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,783
You know definitely worse things just

440
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,367
Caring for example Kris and Corey found this memo

441
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,207
Written by the contractor but the Department of Education had hired

442
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
Kind of deal with a teach Grant

443
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,351
Is contractor was writing a memo to the Department of Education about

444
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
The program

445
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
Basically this memo says

446
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
Gyro guys

447
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,751
We're actually converting to loans

448
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,311
A lot of teachers who seem to be

449
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
MTG Spirit of the program

450
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
And maybe that's not such a good idea

451
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,527
With that they had found the exact same thing you had found basic

452
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
Even this company

453
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,855
Is waving his flag saying

454
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,671
Please don't make us hurt these teachers and

455
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
Nothing happens

456
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,791
And then Chris and Corey found that there was this whole other pool

457
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
I'll teach Grant teacher

458
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,351
As many as 10

459
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Thousand

460
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
Who had mistakenly

461
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
Heather teach Grant turned in

462
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
By mistake this isn't even the paperwork or anything right and then that raises the question

463
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
She's what they do about it

464
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
Well the answer is not a lot

465
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
But slowly

466
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,527
Over the course of like 7 months

467
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Cording Crusade

468
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
Tone from their sources at the Department of Education just

469
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Started the chain

470
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
From we don't know if it's

471
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
Possible to fix this

472
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
I think this might be possible

473
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
To we think we can actually fix

474
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,191
And I kept asking Corey and Kris like okay

475
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
But why did it change

476
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,799
Who changed it who were the evil person hurting teacher

477
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,175
And Kris and Corey kept saying no no it's not like that that's not always how

478
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,503
These government meant well but screwed it all up

479
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,271
Stories go

480
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
I think

481
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
In one really important

482
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
We love our story to have a

483
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
Yeah and

484
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,487
I think for the longest time

485
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
I just assumed that the department was

486
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
Or that the

487
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,935
You know the company that managed the program for the Department was the villain

488
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:25,055
That must be making money off this somehow there's some kind of scam

489
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:30,943
Who's profiting off

490
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,039
You know all this company must be getting rich on the back of these teachers in

491
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,831
Corruption corruption

492
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
And

493
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,135
The scary thing is this is

494
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,207
This is 2019 and the villain

495
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Was Barack

496
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,535
I didn't with the bureaucracy that spanned

497
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,607
The Bush Administration the Obama Administration

498
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,399
And the first half the truck ministration

499
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
I mean

500
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
And this just

501
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
What is this

502
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,263
Machine that was not being chain

503
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Chugging along

504
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Hurting people

505
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
The good news

506
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
For me is that

507
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,199
Ultimately that bureaucracy is made

508
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
And

509
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
If we

510
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Just

511
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Convince

512
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,855
Enough of those humans

513
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
To change direction

514
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
And

515
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,207
Move toward

516
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
A kinder

517
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Gentler program

518
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
It actually happened

519
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
Finally after more than a year

520
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
Kris and Corey got word from the Department of

521
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
It was top secret

522
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
But the deal was.

523
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Department

524
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
Was going to agree

525
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:35,199
The if teachers could prove they were and still are going to keep their end of the deal

526
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,015
The department would convert their loans back in

527
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Again

528
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
This was not public information

529
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
But

530
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,159
Corey and Kris couldn't wait

531
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,463
They wanted to tell Caitlin McCollum themselves

532
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,791
So they asked a local producer to go over to Caitlin's house

533
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
I'm going to

534
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,935
That's Caitlin and her husband age

535
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
And this was back in December

536
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
AGT app for dogs

537
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,055
Kaitlyn in the producer Lexi

538
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
Sit down by the phone so chrisanne

539
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
Inquiry

540
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Intoxicating

541
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,223
Yes Lexie and I are sitting in my living room looking at my

542
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,319
Pine needles all over the floor because we put up a Christmas tree last night

543
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,111
I think we've got

544
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
Some good news here

545
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
You actually

546
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Okay

547
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
As long as you

548
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,768
Can now prove

549
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,584
That you were still meeting the

550
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,168
Teaching requirements you doing what you promised you do

551
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
You're going to get your grandpa

552
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Are you serious

553
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
Oh my God

554
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,552
REI

555
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,512
That is such good news

556
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,328
That's a good news

557
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,728
And I remember Lexie or engineer telling

558
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,568
That sheep she went to the other room where her husband AJ was

559
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Star sun and

560
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
They had a baby gate

561
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
And

562
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,248
You know our Story begins with her at the mailbox getting that letter went

563
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Pregnant

564
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
Her son is now I think he's

565
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Pek to

566
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
And

567
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,928
As she's telling AJ

568
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,464
But it's all over

569
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Elam

570
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,816
We have to keep it under wraps until Monday

571
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:33,216
She's leaning over the baby gate on one side and he's leaning over the baby gate on the other side and they're hugging

572
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
Living life

573
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
Aspire

574
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
You have us both

575
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
At least I'm in here so I don't know

576
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,232
Throughout this entire year of reporting

577
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,584
Kris and Corey had had trouble getting anybody from the Department of Education

578
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,888
You actually record an interview

579
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
On tape

580
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,496
What is the Department of Education started to roll out this fix

581
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
Kris and Corey got an interview

582
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:12,640
In one of the most unbrand moments of this whole story

583
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:17,760
The person chosen to be the face of this so far mostly faceless bureaucracy

584
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,856
With a senior official with a spectacularly long time

585
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,256
Diane Auer Jones with my name and my title is principal Deputy under secretary delegated the duties of us

586
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,840
Under secretary and assistant secretary for postsecondary education

587
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
And towards the end of that energy

588
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,960
There is this kind of unbelievable moment this thing that you just

589
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,520
Don't necessarily expect to hear

590
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,312
From someone representing

591
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
A bureaucracy

592
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,944
This is your chance to talk to a couple million people many of them are teachers

593
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,272
And I'm sure he's what would you say to them now about teacher

594
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:56,672
How sorry we are I mean obviously we want to extend an apology we've put

595
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Teachers

596
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:02,560
Who didn't deserve the stress this pressure this financial burden

597
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,192
In a position that is stressful and frightening and

598
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,728
Confusing and

599
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,104
I can't give them back those years that I can't take away the gray hairs and I can't take away the stress

600
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:19,200
It seems like a small thing to do to say I'm sorry

601
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,040
But I'm very sorry and we want to work to fix it and correct it

602
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,368
As of this story around 7000 teachers

603
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,648
Have applied to get there

604
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Teach grants

605
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,464
So far the vast majority of those

606
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Qualify

607
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
The find out

608
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,608
Ironically the same way they found out everything was screwed up

609
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,912
But a letter in the mail

610
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
From the Department of

611
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
Caitlin McCallum got hers

612
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,800
Just before she was leaving on a family

613
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
She brought the letter

614
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,872
With her in the car

615
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Her husband was driving

616
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:55,808
Her son was in the back seat

617
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,368
Congratulations
