00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,560
David Goldstein lived

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,840
Politics for decades

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:04,864
Behind the scene

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,752
Working on this campaign or the ad campaign always for the Democrats his specialty was the digital stuff

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,128
Choosing which strategy to take online or using data to analyze which voters to focus

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,968
And after years of feeling like he had a handle on how campaigns work

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,248
2016 happy

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,600
Two outcomes most people predicted would never come true came true

9
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,160
First there was brexit in Europe and then

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,184
Donald Trump

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
In America

12
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,000
And when David tries to make sense of it

13
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:36,608
He realizes that some of the same people were behind both campaign

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
It is so rare

15
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,472
And so hard in politics to pull an upset

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,824
I they are few and far between maybe and your entire

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,176
34 tier political career you will be on the winning side of a single upset

18
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
They pulled off

19
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,480
2 upsets

20
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
In back-to-back

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,088
Here's specifically there was one company that worked on both

22
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
Cambridge analytica

23
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:03,488
And as we heard about a lot since then they got caught using personal data without permission

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
Some of it from Facebook

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,376
They're accused of breaking laws but they also claimed to have pulled off new

26
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
Legal tax

27
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
For finding especially personalized

28
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,544
Even intimate ways to persuade voters using online.

29
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,848
There's a lot that was simply

30
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,152
Anime that we hadn't thought of doing the

31
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,688
A big thing was

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,504
Yeah this kind of setting up your own

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,136
Personal like online ecosystem of content meant to persuade people to a certain action

34
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
Currently trying to fly into a web

35
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,768
They were claiming they could create profiles of people based on their online dating

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
And then use that against them

37
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
2 Chainz

38
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,656
Maybe without them even knowing it was happened

39
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,448
Maybe using missing from

40
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
And it just felt like playing dirty

41
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
He's thinking

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,336
This is not how democracy

43
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,688
Should work I'm not somebody who scares easily but I am legitimately scared

44
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
He's looking at this like an arms race

45
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
Race with the Democrats way behind sec

46
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
And he wants to sound in Allah

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,672
He sets up a bunch of meetings at places like Google Facebook

48
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,208
Twitter other big online cup

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
My Hope was

50
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
So there could be some kind of like

51
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:16,192
Cross-industry investigative body that could work with the government and Regulatory and Private Industry

52
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,008
And I was shot down very fast

53
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,592
I imagine the people that he talks with these big tech companies are like

54
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,688
Obviously you can Target people and persuade them

55
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
That is the point of RI plat

56
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
Parts to get the most persuasive ad in front of every person exactly in the way that persuades in the most that is why we get paid

57
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
Call Dad

58
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,048
Nicely though the same person who shot me down says the same time

59
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,608
If you want to see something happen on this

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
You have to do this yourself

61
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
You have to do it too

62
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,240
You have to become a Cambridge analytica yourself

63
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
Well that way yes

64
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
Without

65
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248

David decides

68
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
To mess with them

69
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
And maybe help his own party along the way

70
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,048
When he says he wants to prove there's a threat he needs proof like with a science

71
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,096
Experiment on actual voters

72

Brewers are using Microsoft AI to help them reinvent the way they make beer

80
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,376
AI enables them to analyze raw ingredients for Unique flavors

81
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
So they can develop better beers faster

Sodus Point David living in New York

92
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
He and his main job it is not an apology

93
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
She's not working at a big corporate Ad Agency

94
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,847
The science experiment think he's hatching it's like a Cypress

95
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Nights and weekends

96
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,943
And the first thing he needs to get it going as some money

97
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
It's recalls up some old contacts

98
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
And most of the donors

99
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
He goes to their like

100
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,343
Are you kidding me

101
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,463
You want me to find a plan for you to go Rogue and be a Cambridge analytica of the left with

102
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
Potentially ethically sketchy methods

103

Unreal Motors

104
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
In a real election

105
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
But you don't know which one yet

106
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
And David is like

107
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
Yes

108
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:57,983
Biggs

109
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
That is exactly why

110
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,335
Eventually he scares enough donors

111
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
And raises 85000

112
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Chinese in business

113
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,503
It takes David about two weeks to get his whole team together

114
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
He's going to be the brains he comes up

115
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Strategy

116
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
Text messaging and Designs what people will see when they click

117
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,183
He needs someone to Wrangle the data for him

118
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
Enemies people to design the ad

119
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,071
He'll be right you also check the whole plan over with an election lawyer because

120
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
He wants to stay

121
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,655
Legal so we had kind of formed our team

122
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
Right and we all resolves okay we're going to do this

123
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,591
But the thing was it was like summer 2017

124
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,175
The next big elections are more than a year away

125
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
And he needs a bigger

126
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:45,855
Because he's running a science experiment on voters need lots of Voters he needs a way to make two groups of Voters

127
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Ideally

128
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
Demographically identical

129
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
Voting history

130
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:56,095
Turnout history partisan makeup all the things that he can measure as identical as possible

131
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,143
Into one control group and Winchester

132
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
After his campaign

133
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
And half dump

134
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
And then he's going to measure

135
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
Like a medical drug trial

136
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,311
But for politics

137
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
It was very tough

138
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
To figure out exactly how

139
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,455
We would cut up the potential electorates

140
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,783
In such a way that we could reliably say

141
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,647
We had an impact in the test condition because this did not happen in the control

142
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
And Alabama

143
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Comes through

144
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,487
Senator there Jeff sessions

145
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
General

146
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
So there's an open seat

147
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
So

148
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,423
What happened is the Alabama senate election was called

149
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
It didn't seem winnable

150
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
For the Democrats at first

151
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:42,943
This is that election by the way that ended up with Roy Moore the Republican candidate getting accused of being a pedophile

152
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,527
Instead Jones the Democrat but David is assessing this race

153
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
Way before those are the final

154
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,927
And he knows it's been about 25 years since a Democrat won the senate seat in Alabama

155
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,511
What I plan to my team and what occurred to me was we don't have to win

156
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
It doesn't matter if we

157
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
We just have to show

158
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
In effect

159
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,911
I was like if if he loses

160
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,215
By 14 points

161
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:09,311
But we go back to our group that we hit and the only losses in that group by a point

162
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
We can show

163
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,639
Ss&b

164
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
Boss

165
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
If

166
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Or hypothesis

167
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Is right

168
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
I know how to set up

169
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,343
Pick 3 State Senate districts

170
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
Matches those against three

171
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,951
Three tests district3 control

172
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
And three of those

173
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
You

174
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
And given the ads and the other three

175
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
You don't get mad but you measure them like you did so you can

176
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:38,239
Yeah and with digital ads it's easy to pick who will see your ads

177
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
And who won't

178
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,055
Yeah and in fact

179
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
I think what's

180
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,639
Xidan surprising to a lot of people

181
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,455
Is this element of what we call negative Target

182
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
So if I don't want someone

183
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
To see my ads I can put their name into the system

184
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
And they will never see my advertising

185
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,207
He said he could even feed in the names of all the campaigns

186
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
The journalists covering the race

187
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
The Regulators to

188
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
And make sure that they never see his campaign for

189
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
If he were

190
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:10,495
But the people he does want to Target he can bombard them with whatever ads

191
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
She can afford

192
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
To pay for one of the one of the wonderful things

193
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
Are props awful things

194
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,991
I got this new age of digital advertising is the number of times

195
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
That we can touch you

196
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Right

197
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
That sounds great

198
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,207
Anyway anyhow it's it's if it's referred to as yo

199
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,767
Essentially a touch like how often can I get

200
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,839
Am I content what I want you to see in front of you

201
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
With the old ways

202
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:42,239
Ways a candidate would flood local TV ad and be lucky to get it in front of a voter they wanted to reach Maybe

203
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Twice a day

204
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,567
With the amount of time that people now spend

205
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,383
On their smartphones on their laptops and

206
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,199
Simplii online are 4 to 5 hours a day

207
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
I know I'm hundreds

208
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,039
Of opportunities in one single day

209
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,599
To hit you and possibly even thousands

210
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,903
He can show you one at and then another

211
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,255
Add another testing out different messages or designs on different websites you might check

212
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Trying to figure out

213
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,583
What catches your eye

214
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
And when

215
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:12,703
Going after the same pull up Motors and hitting them over and over and over and over again

216
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,263
Until they figured out what would make them flick

217
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,055
And once the automated ad system

218
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Hesitant

219
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
It learn

220
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
The next time the system tries to

221
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Are you it goes

222
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
Right to the stuff in nose

223
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Always test

224
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Always learn

225
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Very rap

226
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,623
And that's why this is so devastatingly effective

227
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:37,023
Because you can cut into people who are typically very sophisticated viewers people with higher education's

228
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,583
Are people who are very wealthy

229
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,703
But because you're continually exposing them until you find out what

230
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
Flips hair trigger and something always does

231
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,639
You're getting access into that person's mind that you never would have previously

232
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,967
And sometimes looking into that person's mind is relatively

233
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
A harmless

234
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,087
I mean it's just annoying when the internet wants you to buy that pair of sunglasses

235
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
It gets dangerous

236
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
When is trying to change the way you vote especially when the person behind all of this doesn't want you to notice they're even trying

237
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
And this isn't just

238
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
Facebook

239
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
He is trying to reach people

240
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
All over the web regular website

241
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
A system it's like any online ad

242
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
And for all this to work

243
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Do you need to create a

244
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
Hon of different messages to test

245
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,687
Those messages need to lure voters

246
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
The best thing to do for me

247
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
Goodbye phrases

248
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
I want it

249
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,671
Nefarious

250
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,231
So basically

251
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,815
What you are going to click on in the future is what you were clicking on now

252
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:48,959
Reitman that were creatures of habit and makes us so I assumed if I went to right-wing websites and took a look

253
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
At what the advertisers were doing on those

254
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
That would help direct me

255
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
I'm to what

256
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
The brief should be

257
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
For my own content producers in a day

258
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,991
Cuz you had you had actually get inside the mind of

259
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
The Republican

260
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
Normally what you do

261
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
Right is that

262
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,183
It is a kind of obsessive study on the look in the Styles the theme

263
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
The freezing even

264
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,559
Very big on Words having to do with things like yeah

265
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:19,167
Anything that smokes like the flag us patriotism

266
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,519
Honor was very important concept that came out of my deep dive

267
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,871
As I was putting my ass together for them I was trying to tap into those themes

268
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,687
Hurry Elsa I want to show you something

269
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
Betrayal

270
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,295
Of Alabama's honor

271
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
And there's a dude in a cowboy hat

272
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
Alabama's great

273
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
It looks like 1990s

274
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Is website

275
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Level up

276
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
Animation

277
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
Like you did it at home

278
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
Noah paint It's Like A step above

279
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,959
But like looking stencil that you're behind

280
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
He says that it works

281
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Like amateurs

282
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,847
Enough that I was actually curious why he did

283
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
That was on purpose

284
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,479
Absolutely unfair

285
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,551
That wasn't cuz you just had a small budget

286
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:13,951
What are the nice things about working in New York is your you have access to the best talent in the world

287
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:18,047
And yes it was tough for me to tell he's very very talented dark eyes

288
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
This is too nice

289
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Make it simpler

290
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,375
Kenmore black

291
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,471
But those are the ads that fit in with the other ads on the websites that his Target

292
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
You're going to

293
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,287
That's what he gets

294
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,311
And now he's almost ready to

295
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,895
And then the election change

296
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,223
Roy Moore becomes the candidate on the Republican side and

297
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,807
He is now probably the worst candidate imaginable

298
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
Call for a general election

299
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,695
Because this is the time where he's getting barrage by all these allegations about how he's a pedophile

300
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,815
And there are no prominent Republicans saying Roy Moore is unfit for office

301
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,167
Suddenly David science experiment is happening in a nail-biter of a closer look

302
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,519
And maybe the science experiment can help his side win

303
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,871

So David has his Clique harvesting machine

317
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,535
The ecosystem drawing flies into a web

318
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
What is a klick

319
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,887
I mean where do you go when you click

320
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
What happens when they get the

321
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:06,079
The Click is they go to a website that I've set up just for that when this case different websites for different groups of Voters

322
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,151
David plan for Democrats is just a boost voter turnout

323
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,711
Tell when a democrat in Alabama clicks on an ad

324
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,295
They get sent to a website with videos and articles design

325
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
To boost their mood to uplift them and in the process make them feel like everything will come down to their one

326
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,303
With Republicans David's plan is a little savvier little sneakier

327
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
He wants them

328
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
To vote

329
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,959
This man for moderate Republicans is to make them want to write in Canada

330
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
It's other than Roy Moore

331
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
By making them think that that's what everyone else

332
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
So he sends them out at Republic

333
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Looking to

334
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
A website that looks like a news site

335
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
It's filled with

336
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
True stories

337
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,783
About how other Republicans are planning to write in

338
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Other candidate

339
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,599
Is playing for a conservative

340
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
What is to make them

341
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Stay home

342
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
On the conservative website

343
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
I was just for the conservative alabamians

344
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
I filled it

345
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
With content

346
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
That was not written by me

347
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,751
Was written by other conservatives out somewhere anywhere on the web

348
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,567
Tor writing about how terrible

349
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
Roy Moore was

350
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
To not fake news this was

351
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
Not fake news I never once

352
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Created

353
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Article

354
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Tweets

355
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
Nothing ever what does might look like is

356
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
A Breitbart or idrudge Style music

357
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,231
But if it has pieces linking to the local newspaper

358
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:33,631
Or maybe something a conservative writer posted on his blog and it just happens at all these posts on the site pain Troy MO

359
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
It is really bad

360
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,983
David is using a site to create a fake view of the

361
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,519
With real story

362
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,055
They're out of context

363
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
But they are still technically real

364
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
And the point is to dissuade vote

365
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
Sites are already

366
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
His research tells him he'll

367
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,527
I have the most impact

368
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
Closer to the election

369
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
In about a week and a half

370
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Before election day

371
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Everything

372
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Goes like

373
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,023
Essentially what happens is the ad start get pushed out

374
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
Right and they start to appear in front of people

375
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
Time in Alabama

376
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,703
Either on their smartphones or on their laptops

377
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,751
And he waits

378
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Automated system

379
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
About this point

380
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
It's easy to say

381
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,919
He'll come on this is over playing the power of at

382
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
Who really clicks on them

383
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
Or

384
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
I live through Upworthy

385
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
But that is not the

386
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
It doesn't really matter if you do it

387
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
It only matters

388
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Someone

389
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
A sliver

390
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
The people history

391
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
You might be amazed

392
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,887
Right and the guy next to you might be another guy next to dead person might might be mean

393
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,215
But I only need to change 3% of people

394
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,775
In order to effect a given result

395
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,335
Then I can go 97 people down

396
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,663
And not having a fact but as long as I have an effect on one two three

397
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
An only on this one specific action

398
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
But all the rest of the time they're immune

399
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
But to me they're not

400
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Then

401
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
I can literally change the world

402
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
I talk to digital campaign

403
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Republicans and Democrats

404
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Professors who study

405
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,327
Regular old ad buyers for non camp

406
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
And when I told them about Dave

407
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
They all kind of went

408
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
Yep that makes sense

409
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,079
Half of them told me other ways that he could have done it that are even more surface

410
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
But that yeah

411
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
In principle

412
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,431
This is what campaigning is

413
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
And when David checks is early data

414
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
The grand science experiment

415
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
To be working

416
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,719
Always say the biggest shock was the most engaged folks were they conservative

417
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Republicans

418
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
They did the most

419
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,863
Clicking out of any of the groups they spent the most time in his ecosystem of website

420
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
To measure the voting

421
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703
When he does eventually get the voter rolls

422
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,263
And he Compares his Control District with his

423
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
Experimental treatment group

424
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
To see

425
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,871
Which groups turned out to vote more

426
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,687
It looks like he has had a real

427
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
Democrats

428
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
Experimental group

429
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,063
Turn data off 4% higher level

430
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,111
And the Democrats in the control

431
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,927
4% so you think that your work

432
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Cuz 4% higher turnout

433
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Yes

434
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
In the places you try to

435
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
Yes

436
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
That's a lot

437
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
Most of that is more than the margin of victory

438
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,191
In a lot of Elections

439
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Loads

440
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Yeah

441
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,775
It's enough to flip an election

442
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Absolute

443
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:26,943
And the Republicans did it work on them it did the experimental condition was two and a half percent lower

444
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,015
For the moderate Republicans

445
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,343
You believe you caused a two and a half percent lower turnout

446
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
For the moderate Republicans the fact that you targeted

447
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,743
Exactly and then for the conservative Republicans

448
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
Was 4.4%

449
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Can I have a drop off

450
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
Which is which is also a lot to take out of someone's face

451
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Exactly

452
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,239
Roy Moore loses the election to Doug Jones the Democrat

453
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
We just

454
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
1 + 1/2

455
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,871
This is a little over 20000 votes Statewide

456
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
So I asked David

457
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,455
What did he think that his science

458
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Experiment

459
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Had caused

460
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
I would say we could reasonably lay claim

461
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
About 89000

462
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,159
That sounds like a lot of vote

463
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:13,279
I'm serious I guess it's a big claim

464
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
Yes but

465
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
I'm fine sharing the

466
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,423
Yap shut the data with whoever wants to see the data

467
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,007
You know I would like to take a look at the data

468
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
I looked

469
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
And I wouldn't talk to professors who studied

470
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,895
Another campaign strategist on the roof

471
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
And I talked to David Quinn

472
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
And

473
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,551
It's pretty much impossible

474
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,575
To verify

475
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,159
They said there's too many variables are too little information

476
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,767
Like maybe Doug Jones held a bunch of big rallies in one of the testis

477
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Or

478
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
Maybe a big influential pastor

479
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:52,959
Have a church in one of the tests District made a big show of writing in his vote against Roy Moore

480
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
Could be all kinds of

481
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,663
And even by his own numbers and his own calculations the impact that David had on Democratic turnout is up

482
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,711
Because you're like to percent change

483
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,991
When you factor in a few more

484
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,367
Most of the experts that I talked to we're skeptical of how big his numbers were

485
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,903
Given how little money

486
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,439
But

487
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
One of the campaigners

488
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,047
I talked to also told me that they've heard of other

489
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,583
Send other studies

490
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,167
Other campaign groups that are not ever going to be made public

491
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
And in a lot of ways

492
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
This isn't so far out of line

493
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,103
What's different here is the person who ran this campaign

494
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
What's this

495
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,943
Doing it pretty much on his own from an office in a city

496
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
Many states away

497
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,575
Make it look easy to build an algorithmic system that could sway thousands of votes

498
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
For less than $100,000

499
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,439
What do you do after you meddling in election

500
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:53,887
Intense term but I got it so you start showing it to other people who have to worry about

501
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
The next

502
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
Election themselves

503
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,031
After his experiment David showed his results to democratic

504
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,567
And you said

505
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,407
Hire me and I will show you how to do what I did

506
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
Or at least

507
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,783
Learn how to fight against what I did because anyone can do it or even worse

508
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Is it

509
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,440
Just inevitable that that's going to keep happening as long as we have online ads

510
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:24,096
I mean I necessarily I think it was far easier to sway people with the TV ad in the early days of TV

511
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
Is a

512
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
Ways to do the radio ads and I think

513
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
Right now we're in a bit of a

514
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,752
Free and easy.

515
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,544
I think when it comes to digital

516
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,104
Online advertising but

517
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,432
You know I do have a belief that as we grow more

518
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,248
Sophisticated should make it more difficult

519
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
For folks like me

520
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
I'm not an empath

521
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
After I talked with him

522
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
I was thinking

523
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,160
This is just an arms race

524
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
And I wondered

525
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
If that ever let him do just want

526
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
A truce to go back to the

527
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,584
So I asked him if he ever brought that up with him

528
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,144
He wrote me an email back and he said he had

529
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
He said this makes it cheaper for campaigns to reach voters

530
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
Easier to get a message

531
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Campaigns won't give that

532
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,592
Also he wrote

533
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
I don't know how to say

534
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
I'll stop if you do

535
