Right

28
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,152
When I first thought I was like

00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:49,920
This thing belongs

00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968

What's a good one any

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,288
I recommend shrimp versus

40
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:22,688
Is crab is always a crowd-pleaser shrimp vs. clam close follow-up I'm guessing I should put my money on the shrimp

41
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,992
Shrimp vs. crab

42
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528

Shrimp and crab leg staring at each other

00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,280
NN wow back in the sky into a corner

46
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,864
Oh I think

47
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
This is

48
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,264
Arm looking at a little Club coming out of the head of the shrimp

49
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
Smashing crab over and over again

50
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
God

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,432
This is a badass

52
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
Sea creature

53
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
It is indeed and you are not alone if you look at the view count

54
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
Over there

55
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,600
They can pack over 300 lb

56
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
The force in that

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
Smash

58
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,256
People keep these mantis shrimp in in reinforced aquarium cuz they can actually smashed

59
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,280
The glass open

60
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
But this is not just for funsies this is not why we are here at Planet Money today because of a scientist named Sheila

61
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984
And she studies

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,288
These mantis shrimp for her job

63
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
And specifically this

64
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
Heart of the mantis shrimp called

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,664
Hammer part of the arm

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Club that you saw

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
So that hammer moves at the

68
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,296
Acceleration of a bullet bursting out of

69
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,112
Accelerations this fast at this

70
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
Scale underwater human Engineers have not been

71
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
She was researching gotten money from the Department of

72
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
Defense from the National Science Foundation

73
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
And then in 2015 something happened

74
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
A US senator

75
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
Decided that she was research

76
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Was a waste

77
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
Of taxpayer money

78
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
Which is why you brought the story

And her Badass rap

84
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:16,096
There is an extremely awkward science fair Star Wars puns Galore

85
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,448

Sheila paddocks troubles started in December of

95
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,640
It was my birthday weekend

96
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
She was a biologist she has a lab at Duke

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,784
And she was at the lab answering some emails before heading home for the weekend

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
When she gets this one

99
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,672
That had and they had her Good Morning America ABC News

100
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
Query

101
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,280
An ABC news reporter was emailing Shelia to get her reaction

102
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,863
How did Sheila feel about her work being put

103
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
In a waste book

104
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,727
Facebook or or sometimes it's called the waste report on oversight

105
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Fortnite lots of name

106
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
It's a document that a member of Congress puts out

107
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Basically

108
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,639
Big list of projects funded with Federal money

109
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,455
That this Congress person thinks didn't deserve that money

110
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
And according to this ABC news reporter

111
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,319
This is what had happened to Sheila

112
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
A US senator

113
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Had learned about her shrimp

114
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
Decided this was a waste of federal money

115
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
I'm put it in his ways

116
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,327
When I read that email I have to say my

117
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Stomach sore

118
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
Fell through the floor

119
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,935
Because she knew it was coming

120
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,311
You will not believe what your government is wasting your tax dollars

121
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,359
100 examples of government

122
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,967
Duke University got the money to actually pick shrimp against each other

123
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,807
$707,000 stuff you can't make it up

124
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,879
The study that landed Sheila in the waist

125
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
It was actually buy one of her grads do

126
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,023
Do mantis shrimp they have this arm that ended up a rounded hammer

127
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,119
And they use this to smash open snail shells this is what they eat snails

128
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
And it's Hammer that used to crack open the shells

129
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,495
The other thing that the shrimp do with these hammers

130
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
Is whale on each other

131
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,639
And so she looks grad student want to know what is going on in the strip fight

132
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,015
Shrimp are using those hammers to repeatedly bash each other on a super strong

133
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
Armored tail plate

134
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
The trampolines the most hits

135
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,927
Which raises some interesting questions like

136
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,231
What is this armor tale play

137
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Made out of

138
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,815
How is it that its enduring so many hits without being

139
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
It's just pretty cool engineering out

140
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
The waste book

141
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
However

142
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
It's not exactly described

143
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
The study like this

144
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:08,639
This year we have a shrimp Fight Club Fight Club Duke University gets money to actually pitch

145
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
Shrimp against each other

146
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,503
That is Senator Jeff Flake on Fox news on the record

147
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,575
Jeff Flake is a Republican senator from Arizona

148
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,159
And he's the one who put Sheila's Research into his 2015 waste book

149
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,999
A list of the most wasteful uses of taxpayer money that year

150
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,143
And so you know Senator flake's office declined our request for an interview both with the senator and a senior staff member

151
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
Jeff Flake is a fiscal conservative

152
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
He's a crusader against Congressional earmarking which is another practice of sneaking goodies into the budget for your constituent

153
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,455
He is Frugal and very proud of that fact

154
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
And he loves

155
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Puns

156
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,063
Which are all over the wait book

157
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Fake Facebook

158
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,183
Is straight-up campy in 2015 the full title was

159
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
The waste book

160
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,255
The farce awakens

161
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
Okay the Star Wars reboot was just about to come out and end the whole report is Star Wars themed hair is Jeff

162
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
Flake introducing his Facebook

163
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
On the senate floor

164
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,799
It's my hope my only hope that

165
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Shreveport gives Congress

166
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Something to chew on

167
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
Chewy

168
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Chewbacca

169
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:20,319
For a debt and deficit saddles taxpayers

170
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,135
And they finally Strike Back

171
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,719
The cover of the ways book it features a cartoon of Lake

172
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,583
Wielding the lightsaber with Richie is presumably ready to lay the fat from the federal budget

173
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
Flip to page 78

174
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
And you will find a full three page write-up

175
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
Oh She Glows shrimp Fight Club

176
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
Plus a price tag

177
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,335
707000 taxpayer dollars

178
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
So one of the things I've noticed about the waste books

179
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
If there's kind of just like there's a lot of jokes

180
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,063
That's Brian Burkey former Congressional staffer

181
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
The point of this kind of

182
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,415
It's written from the senator right though

183
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
Showing the personalities little bit

184
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,559
Brian Burkey did not help write Jeff Flake wastebook but he's helped write other ways

185
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,375
Reports for Senator Tom Coburn and James Lankford

186
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Goshen Bryan's home state of Oklahoma

187
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,983
This is Brian's executive director of

188
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
Store accountability

189
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,079
A nonprofit that educates young people about the Nash

190
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
Points out it is not just science pending that gets criticized

191
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,527
Netflix the force awakens science projects are about a quarter of the

192
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
Brian said yes the government

193
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
She totally fun science

194
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
We don't come

195
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,767
To that from the perspective that don't understand

196
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,095
Yeah the importance of basic science research

197
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
Money is being spent in the wrong

198
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
A few years ago the NIH director said

199
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,567
Maybe we'd have an Ebola vaccine right now if it weren't for all of those

200
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Budget cuts

201
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
So Brian says

202
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Okay

203
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
Not enough money for Ebola

204
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
But we have money for the stuff in the waste book

205
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
And it's not

206
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599
Pit one against the other necessarily but that's

207
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,391
Kind of congress's job right

208
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,719
Budgeting is our job resources are limited

209
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
20 trillion-dollar national debt

210
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,071
Somebody's project Heidi behind the veil

211
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Call Santa

212
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
Science is just

213
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
You know

214
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
We just don't agree with that

215
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,055
And this is basically the message that Senator Jeff Flake

216
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
6abc in December 25th

217
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
When he released his

218
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967
A lot of those studies are very legitimate and useful

219
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,319
But a good number of them to think who would the world thought up this stuff

220
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:33,695
But somebody's got to okay this who's the person that's saying okay to the stuff who's writing the check

221
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Great question

222
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,047
From Greta Van Susteren she was a Fox anchor at the time

223
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Who is writing the checks

224
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631
Where does your lab

225
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,655
Get money

226
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
Yeah so I'll walk you through this process

227
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,543
She'll pay for this so-called shrimp Fight Club

228
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,847
With money from the National Science Foundation

229
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:56,991
It's not easy to get these grants and Sheila's filled about 90% of proposals get rejected

230
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,135
But she like gets a grant she gets about $900,000 to be distributed over five

231
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
Certificate

232
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Frites

233
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,511
Except now she has to knock off $400,000

234
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,047
If roughly

235
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:15,679
$400,000 which is going to chill at University for overhead or lab building her utilities

236
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,799
Now she's got about $500,000 left which works out to buy by 5.

237
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,359
Divided by 5 years a hundred thousand dollars a year

238
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:29,759
That goes to pay a postdoc grad student pay for everybody's Conference travel summer program that brings grade school

239
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,319
Teachers tissues lab Fight Club

240
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
Yeah how much was that

241
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,903
What I can tell you it doesn't it's in the order

242
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,719
Only a couple thousand dollars if that much

243
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
This is one of the things that really are Chihuahua about the waste bucket made it sound like she spent hundreds of thousands of.

244
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Dollars on just one study on this

245
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:54,079
Shrimp Fight Club when instead she spend it on multiple totally different studies on training young scientist and mentor

246
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,151
Preschool teachers and so sitting there at her desk

247
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,223
On her birthday weekend she had a choice to make

248
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,319
Ignore the wastebook wait for the new cycle to move on

249
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
But she didn't

250
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
She did not want to slink away

251
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
Like a mantis shrimp who just lost a fight

252
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
A barrel of mantis shrimp

253
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
She decided to fire back

254
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,095
At Senator flake Strike Back

255
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:20,447
Make the case for why mantis shrimp matter and then

256
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
It becomes something constructive

257
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,335
Not that miserable Sinking Feeling we have to hide

258
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
4

259
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Feeling like

260
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,455
Man what is up with politics

261
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,527
Why am I the focus of this now

262
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,855
It's just so stupid at some level

263
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
But I felt like

264
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,231
I deserve to have it I have a chance to

265
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,791
Explain why what we do is important

266
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,399
For the broader goal of explaining why science is important

267
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
To the world

268
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,703
And then she got her chance

269
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,007
Sheila got another email

270
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
An invitation

271
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
To washing

272
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
Which Sheila come to Capitol Hill

273
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Is that her real

274
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,455
Can members of Congress

275
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
Coming up

276
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
The Tempest

277
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:10,879
Weirdest science fair you've ever attended as so-called spendthrift scientists meet Congress

278
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
The Brick

Okay

285
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
The trip to DC

286
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,479
3 months after her research showed up and Senators like sway

287
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
Facebook

288
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,039
Sheila Patek on an invitation

289
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
His her reception

290
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
I2 science advocate

291
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Sea grapes

292
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,207
Any idea what's researchers have been singled out

293
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
In these way surfboards

294
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Go to the hill

295
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
They would set up in the Senate Office Building

296
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
And Congress people would drop by

297
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,703
And the scientist would explain the value of their work

298
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,263
If we make the case that the wastebook got them wrong

299
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,335
So in April 2016 Sheila's standing in this

300
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Beautiful Marble Room

301
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
In front of a poster about man

302
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
And she surrounded by all these

303
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:14,111
So-called pilfers of the public person a few feet away there's the scientist to put monkeys in hamster balls on treadmill

304
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
Also the public health researcher who inspired this headline

305
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
That's wonder why fat girls can get

306
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
Another Sheila

307
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,167
You know one thing that we heard a lot was please do not get mad at the people who show up

308
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
Flake wasn't the only politician on the invite list

309
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
In the last decade waste books of taking off in DC

310
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Is a handle a congressman

311
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,919
Grinnell publish their own takes on the waste report

312
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
Slightly different spins

313
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,247
Senator James Lankford has his

314
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Federal fumbles

315
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
John McCain has America's most wasted

316
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
Rand paul the waste report

317
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
Steve Russell waste watch

318
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
All have been invited

319
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
All of them

320
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
You might have noticed a Republican

321
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
But that wasn't always the case

322
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
The guy who's

323
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
Footsteps always book writers follow

324
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
The Founding Father of the waste book

325
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
Who's a Democrat

326
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
Senator William proxmire from wisco

327
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:10,687
Proxmire is someone who isn't afraid to take strong stances he is an early advocate of

328
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
Finance reform

329
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
He was a very early critic of the Vietnam War

330
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,135
That's my story and Melinda Baldwin she's written about proxmire and early signs

331
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
He's also a diet and drugging in

332
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,047
Melinda says one time during this debate about whether or not the Senate

333
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Get approved funds

334
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
New gym

335
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,423
Proxmire gets up and he says that's a waste of taxpayer money

336
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
None of you need a gym

337
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,263
You should all learn to jog and I will teach you how

338
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Pressler actually had a book about jogging

339
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
You can do it

340
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
!

341
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,967
Senator proxmire exercise diet and relaxation plan

342
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:50,367
But that moment I think it was very much in in proxmire is Grand tradition because the other thing that is really famous for

343
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,671
Is being an aggressive critic

344
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Of government spending

345
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
Proxmire

346
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Hated

347
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
You wanted to root it out

348
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
Aa1975

349
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
He hits on a brilliant idea

350
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
The Golden Fleece award

351
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
The Golden Fleece Awards work

352
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
Like that every month

353
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,543
Proxmire will award a prize

354
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,383
Imagine prizoniera quotes here because if it's not a prize it's a Badge Of Dishonor

355
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,967
Apprised to the most egregious use of taxpayer money

356
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
Any prizes get at

357
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
The press releases

358
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
How funny

359
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
They're funny and the little mean

360
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,927
Genus of flakes

361
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,487
A stock that is classic proxmire

362
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
I'm proxmire

363
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,351
Goes after science Melinda says it's not that proxmire was against

364
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
Government funding of science per se

365
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
It's just that he didn't

366
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,007
Want to fun stuff it seemed like it would never

367
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:39,775
Payoff

368
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
And ask Melinda

369
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
We've been doing this week's report thing for

370
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
For decades

371
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
How's the argument change

372
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
We just

373
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
Dancing the same dance

374
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:54,623
I think it's kind of the same dance I think that it in a way we're all still dancing to prox Myers tune

375
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
So she looks come all the way up to DC for this

376
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
Incredibly awkward science fair

377
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
And she wants to make the case

378
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Senator flake for why

379
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
Mantis shrimp matter

380
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
And here she has this chance to

381
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
Break out of the stands

382
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
That we bought them stuff

383
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Affliction

384
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,287
She was told somebody from his office would show up

385
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
I was expecting

386
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,871
You know some kind of staffer

387
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
The Intern

388
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
Yeah then turn right

389
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,855
And so I'm sitting there talking to somebody and I look up towards the entrance and I see Senator flake who's actually

390
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,927
Quite a distinctive looking person Senator flake

391
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Tall

392
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Pan

393
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Beaming smile

394
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,143
And I and I almost passed out I freak

395
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Ouch

396
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
And I'm like

397
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,543
I'm trying to get myself back to the president to talking to the person who is presenting to

398
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
And I see him

399
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,407
Slowly weaving his way towards me

400
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,271
Tell ya so gradually he made his way to my station

401
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
What do you say like what happened

402
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
Well he came up and

403
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
Was very polite

404
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
And I said you know may I present to you

405
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,535
No work and he said

406
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Ensure

407
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
And here's what she was told her

408
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Shrimpy's

409
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
Fight Club mantis shrimp

410
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,727
Bear claw bring us when it comes to engineering

411
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,799
Are performing our best systems by orders of magnitude

412
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,847
I started by just showing him

413
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
What engineering is not doing today

414
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
Violet has been doing 4 million

415
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Interferes

416
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Shrimp

417
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551
The wielder hammers acceleration

418
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
On par with a bullet

419
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Coming out of a gun

420
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
Accelerations that out

421
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
Missiles and race cars

422
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,487
And they don't use combustion

423
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
Justice system of

424
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,559
Springs and latches in their arm

425
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
Assistant that they deploy

426
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Over

427
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
Over and over without it

428
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Breaking

429
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
And they do this in water

430
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,055
A tiny scale but human Engineers can't replicate

431
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,895
Before example mantis shrimp can open the snail shells

432
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
With such tiny hammer

433
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,735
Said they weigh about the mass of

434
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Tattoo toothpick

435
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,087
And they can hit one of these snails that we have to use a hammer

436
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
And they can break them

437
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
And then she really sells it

438
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
She explains what this could do

439
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,231
For humans

440
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
She explained

441
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
Mantis shrimp

442
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,607
Even though they're wielding their deadly hammers at bullet like

443
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
Accelerations

444
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,447
Avoid this weird fluid dynamics thing called cavity

445
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
Usually when you're moving as fast

446
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
What does a mantis shrimp does underwater

447
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
You create the

448
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
Area of Low Pro

449
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,967
And the water literally vaporizes in that spot it forms a little bubble called the cavity

450
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
And this bubble

451
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Implode

452
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,111
In a burst of light creating heat equivalent to

453
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
To the surface of the

454
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
The Sun

455
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,231
Habitation will wear away the steel on a boat

456
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
Color

457
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,303
It's the bane of Naval engineers

458
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
Mantis shrimp avoided

459
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,679
Until the final moment when their Hammer hits that snail shell

460
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Michelle crack

461
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
In a burst of heat and light

462
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
How do they do it

463
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,847
Or take that the tail plate that these shrimp use in fights

464
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,199
This template is taking blows like a punching bag over and over

465
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
But I like a punching bag

466
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Light

467
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,087
And that's why Engineers have been using Sheila's research

468
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,927
To help him develop materials to make better Sports helmets in better armor

469
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,487
And I have to say

470
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
I guess we all know this

471
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,863
That a lot of times it really helps

472
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
To have a conversation face to face

473
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:25,567
I mean I think we all know that but it's good to be reminded

474
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,943
Yoshi real I really felt like he was listening or else he was a good Faker but I think it was listening

475
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
Sushi Legos for it

476
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:35,295
And I said you is any of this worthwhile to you

477
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,391
Any pointed to the part of her poster about human applications

478
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,951
And he said that that seemed worthwhile to him

479
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
But here's the thing

480
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Senator flake

481
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,375
He wants these human application

482
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
But if he wants this

483
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,751
Particular human application this bio-inspired armor

484
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:00,639
You only get that if you gamble in the first place that investigating animals as weird as the mantis shrimp

485
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
Might pay off

486
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,991
And the government makes these gambles all the time

487
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
The federal government spends about 34

488
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,111
Billion dollars a year on basic research

489
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,415
So it is totally fair to ask

490
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
What kind of return are we getting on that investment like

491
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
What is the number

492
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:21,375
I think it would be very dangerous for Economist to tell you that there's a number

493
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
That is Paula Stephan

494
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
Professor of Economics at Georgia

495
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
State University

496
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
Who could not give us a number

497
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
I was like look

498
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
You want to rate of return

499
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,871
You've got to know what the benefits are

500
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,943
And you also have to know what the cost

501
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,015
Time for something like a stock market investment that's

502
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Too hard to figure out

503
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,855
But figuring that out for science

504
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Good luck

505
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,463
I mean the perfect example that everyone in my field brings up

506
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,255
Is the atomic clock

507
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,815
In 1879

508
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,399
A guy named Lord Kelvin rights that maybe we could use Adams

509
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Tell time

510
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,519
But it takes about seven decades before a physicist named Robbie

511
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,567
Actually figures out how to do it

512
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
And Wallah

513
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:08,223
You know most people I think who turn on their GPS device

514
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,551
Don't have a clue that we would not have GPS

515
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,599
If it weren't for the atomic clock

516
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,416
This becomes a problem because if we want to calculate

517
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:22,048
How much money went into the invention of GPS like a truly transformative technology do I have to go

518
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,840
All the way back to Lord Kelvin

519
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:28,448
And that's just the cost side of the equation write how do you calculate the benefit

520
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,520
Because sometimes investments in science they

521
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Payoff

522
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
What's PayPal

523
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
Really big

524
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,408
Like they did with the MRI

525
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,688
And the laser

526
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
And oh yeah the internet

527
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
And yeah you can try to put a number on those benefits people have tried to calculate the economic value of the internet

528
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,744
The problem though with those studies is that they've just been selected on winners

529
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:52,768
No

530
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
And there

531
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:58,400
A number of research projects out there that don't have a

532
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
Happy Ever After ending

533
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
So to speak

534
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,288
But if you ask Sheila by her work is important

535
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,336
Doesn't talk to you about the economics

536
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
Not the kind of payoff

537
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
She talking about

538
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,456
The knowledge

539
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,016
That we generate in my lab

540
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
Is why it's important

541
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,112
It's that we have

542
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:24,512
Explored biology we have tested it we have we have put it to the most rigorous scientific

543
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,328
Analysis that we possibly can

544
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,680
And from that we've been able to say new things about the world

545
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
And that

546
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,544
Is what I think the value of what I do is

547
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
A month after their conversation

548
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,664
Senator Flake released another waste

549
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
It's science beans

550
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
20 questions

551
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,832
Government studies that will leave you scratching your head

552
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:52,672
The cover features the latest poster children of wasteful science spending

553
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,208
