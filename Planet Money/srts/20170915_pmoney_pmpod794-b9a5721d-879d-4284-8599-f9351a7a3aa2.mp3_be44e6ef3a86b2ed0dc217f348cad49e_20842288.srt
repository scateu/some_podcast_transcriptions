17
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,856
So if you're listening with kids

18
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,696
Before Ill Mind was Ill Mind he was Ramona bong

19
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,256
A kid from New Jersey who loved to play Super Nintendo

20
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,048

Call Mario Paint

22
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,632
And in that game

23
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,472
There's a feature that allows for you to compose music which is like

24
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,240
Insane

25
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,544
The game that you make cartoons with a Nintendo

26
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,336
And then like as a side

27
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,896
Feature you can create this kind of cheesy music

28
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,944
You can create any beat any tune

29
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
To go with the cartoon

30
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Don't mind got obsessed with making music in this

31
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,112
He didn't save any of the songs

32
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,440
But you can find tons of Mario Paint music today on YouTube

33
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,488
You would grab like the mushroom

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,048
Character and that would be your bass drum

35
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,376
And then like the Cooper Trooper would be like your snare drum

36
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,192
Mario space with a piano start with a xylophone

37
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592

38
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,176
Sitting in a room alone using technology to make music

39
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,968

59
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,408
A few years after he got obsessed with Mario Paint my twin Optical

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
But it didn't last

61
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,480
He dropped out moved into his mom

62
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,552
I just messed around all day with a keyboard and a cheap

63
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,648
This is not what his parents had in mind when they immigrated from the Philippines

64
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
Things to give him a better life

65
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,512
What a tense is definitely intense I mean

66
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,816
The first 5-6 years

67
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,400
What are you in your mom's basement for five or six years I was

68
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,240
I was yeah that's a long time long time man

69
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
And then in 2006

70
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Illmind github

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
He gets a call from a guy to record live

72
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
Could found some of the music reminded posted on my

73
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Shout to Myspace

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,064
The guy asked if you're more of Hillman's music to develop a little bit of relationship

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
And not long after that

76
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,648
He's like hey

77
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,952
LL Cool J wants to use when your track

78
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Righto

79
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,584
So I ended up doing a record for LL Cool J called Queens

80
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
And 50 Cent was on the record

81
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
And so they paid me $6,000

82
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
To do that track

83
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
Shitload of money

84
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,456
I'm have never seen that much money in my life and they pay me in cash

85
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:36,832
So what you do with it I remember I took that money and I

86
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
Put a deposit on an apartment

87
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
So I finally moved out

88
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,000
Bang bang meme

89
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
So this was a break for Ill Mind

90
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
But it's not like he's got at me

91
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
He is at this point like

92
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
Thousands of other young produce

93
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Managed

94
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
To get what's called a place

95
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
Somebody paid to use

96
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,336
Now he wants to get to the neck

97
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
He wants to be

98
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
Not just in a 1000

99
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,016
He wants to be a famous producer he wants to be somebody with his own son

100
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:11,392
To do this he decides he's got to stop using the sort of generic drum beats that he's been using

101
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
And come up with something nobody else has

102
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,768
But it's not like he can afford to let you know read a music studio and

103
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Pay some professional drummers

104
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
Capa drum over

105
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
So he comes up with a different technique

106
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
Yeah mean it was me it was me in a closet

107
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Yasso

108
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,287
Literally me in a closet

109
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
With like

110
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,919
Yeah you know Tam tambourines and like shakers in like couple other snare drums

111
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,759
Is there a closet in your apartment closet in my apartment and I was just like

112
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
Creating my own sounds

113
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Italy right

114
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Top manipulate those are

115
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,695
Increase this whole library of hundreds of sound

116
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
Uses those to make his

117
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Two songs

118
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
Starts getting more work

119
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Does some more stuff with him

120
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
50 Cent works on it

121
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
Tupac Remix album

122
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,983
Start hanging out getting to know people in the industry and people start to know Illinois

123
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
And he's fat

124
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,311
So one day I woke up 2011

125
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
And I said to myself well

126
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
I have a little bit of a following

127
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Right

128
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,271
And I'm wondering if there's producers out there

129
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
Who won

130
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Illmind

131
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
He thinks

132
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
Oh my drum sounds on my

133
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,159
Play tambourine sound

134
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Snaps and everything else

135
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
Are just digital files on my lap

136
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,047
I could sell those online

137
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
I mean not not home

138
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Snuggle Song

139
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
Just sell a folder with like a hundred different song

140
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
Sound of a snare drum being hit

141
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
Tambourine shaking one time

142
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
Other producers could by the pack

143
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
And use it to make

144
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Their music

145
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175
He thinks it could be a way for me to make a little money

146
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
Get my name out there a little more among other producers

147
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Or

148
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,623
Maybe you would be selling away the one thing that made people want to use an Ill Mind beat

149
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
Instead of some other

150
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
I'm I'm afraid that

151
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
People

152
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Might end up sounding like me

153
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
Right in that that was the whole fear

154
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
Behind

155
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:01,727
That that old school mentality of not sharing your sound as well there's only one me

156
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
If I put my sounds out then will be

157
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
Hundreds of versions of me right and you are all you got right like your whole business is that you sounds only like you and nobody else

158
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
Sounds like you and if that's gone

159
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
You got nothing

160
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
The exactly

161
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
Three ways these options

162
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
Thinks about it and decides

163
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,719
You know what I'm just some guy playing the tambourine in a closet in New Jersey

164
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
Why not

165
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
So

166
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
So I said you know what 20-25 bucks

167
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
Hundred 250 sounds

168
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
Zendaya in a folder

169
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
And that's why I'm going to charge so

170
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
I went to my blog site

171
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,031
And I put up a PayPal Now button

172
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
And

173
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:42,175
And address I didn't think anything of it I said okay O mine drum kit I named it a black

174
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
Elap

175
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,343
Kit black it just like a cool name right and to be clear what he puts in this folder is not beats or songs

176
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,927
Just individual sounds manipulated all these two

177
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,279
For snare drums alone there are 46 different files

178
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Each with its own name

179
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,863
There's snare basic

180
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
Snare blue

181
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
Snare board

182
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
Near born again

183
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727

184
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
Near buzzworthy

185
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
And those are just the bees

186
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,127
So just this folder with 113 Whittlesey

187
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
No man has no idea what's going to happen

188
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
He posted online and

189
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
I woke up the next morning

190
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
And I found that

191
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
I had like

192
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,159
$2,000 in my PayPal account that I didn't have the knife

193
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
Before

194
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,487
So I'm like holy s*** like

195
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
People want this thing

196
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
So

197
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,143
So I'm like wow and then like more sales are coming in

198
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,239
And so I literally you know I didn't have an e-commerce store

199
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Who is PayPal so

200
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,359
I was literally emailing every single customer saying hey

201
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
Appreciate you buying a drunk here's the downloads

202
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
People keep buying a

203
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,015
And for a while he's worried that everybody's going to start sounding

204
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,599
But when you listen to the music people are making with his kids

205
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
I discovered that

206
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,487
You know a lot of these producers that are using my sounds

207
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Don't sound like

208
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,119
They're taking my sounds and they're kind of putting their own unique Twisted them

209
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,703
You know discovering that was was a big

210
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
Revelation for me like

211
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
I can put all these sounds out and people out there won't

212
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,151
Necessarily you know take my spot or steal my sound

213
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
Other people figured out the same thing

214
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,831
Back window mine release that first black kid drum kits with his new idea something just a few people were

215
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
And a lot of people were free

216
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
Since then the ideas taken off

217
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
Now there's this whole industry

218
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Drum kit

219
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Sample packs

220
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,839
All these different kind of like Lego blocks

221
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,375
Blocks that producers can use to build

222
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,215
Princeton's there's this company called splice in New York

223
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
Bay Breeze millions of dollars in Ventura

224
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
And they want to be

225
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Kind of like the net

226
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
They're signing up famous producers

227
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
Create sample pack

228
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Saxon drum kit

229
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
It's just reply

230
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
And through the company you get access to this

231
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
Huge library of

232
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,623
You know drums and pianos and effect

233
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,671
Everything you can think

234
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
Soaps place is kind of

235
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
One end of the spectrum

236
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,607
There's also this other very high

237
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,959
An end of this guy there is a big-time producer named

238
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Frank.

239
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,287
Frank Dux has put out this record light

240
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
And the record label releases out

241
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Like this one

242
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Call the lap of Lux

243
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
But the songs on this album and the other album they are not made to go on the radio or on Spotify

244
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,159
They're made just for other producers to sample

245
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Chop up

246
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,583
And remix and put into songs that do go on the radio

247
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
And on Spotify

248
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
When that happens

249
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
Frank Dukes often ends up getting

250
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Royalty

251
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,239
This means he can make

252
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
Tons of

253
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
Don't mind just got into this high-end sample busy

254
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:54,175
But he's also still releasing those basic black kid

255
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,735
That people can buy for 20 or 30 bucks

256
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
And use however they

257
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Fast forward to now

258
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
Which is 6 years later

259
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
Is become this full-blown

260
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
Like

261
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
Legit business

262
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,255
Give me some sense

263
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
It's like what what's the revenue more or less

264
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,631
Order of magnitude of Revenue

265
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,703
Every year every year hundreds of thousands of dollars yeah

266
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,263
And this is people buying kids for twenty bucks

267
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:24,895
What you turn on the radio do you just like you're like oh I know where that got that

268
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Kick Drum

269
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
All the time

270
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,015
All the time I put on a Spotify playlist when I got there as my snare

271
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,111
I like out there's my cowbell you no listen listen

272
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
I mean Bruno Mars

273
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
His new album has blackheads all over it

274
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
You know Kendrick Lamar's new album

275
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
Taylor Swift recent album

276
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
A lot of these are just like

277
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,887
Ice near here or snapped

278
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,495
But there's one that he played for me that is a little easier for an ordinary person to

279
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
It's going to get called all grunts everything

280
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,895
Ill Mind Zone voice tweet in all these different way

281
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
Come on play me some

282
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
Coming

283
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,599
Yeah

284
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,439
Don't mind recently heard that last sound out in the wild

285
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
Curative

286
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Again

287
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Yeah

288
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,559
You heard it on an album called Malibu

289
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
By Anderson paak right here

290
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:27,359
A little Yeah Yeah Yeahs Play It Again

291
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,135
I know it's hard to hit

292
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,439
So this is obviously subtle

293
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:46,815
I mean I could barely hear it I was sitting there next to Ill Mind and he was pointing it out

294
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
But apparently

295
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
Two music producers

296
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
It is not

297
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,263
Music producers listen to a song and they hear every single part in their head

298
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
The way say

299
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
Home chef

300
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
Can be eating some

301
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Fancy complex dish

302
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,919
And taste every single ingredient

303
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,223
Music producers listen to this song

304
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
And they hear Ill Mind you

305
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
And they recognize

306
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,831
And a lot of the time

307
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
Do you like it

308
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,183
And so the black cats have become not just a source of income for

309
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
They've been sort of an ad

310
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
Other producers hear the sea

311
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Anthony decide

312
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
Oh I want to work more with you

313
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
All songs with her

314
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,983
I never been this whole other part of Ill Mind career where he has made songs for people like

315
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,007
Drake and

316
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
Kanye and J Cole

317
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
Will have that part of his career

318
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
In a minute

319
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,199
Support for this podcast and the following message come from Delta

320
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,271
Delta flies to 300 cities around the world

321
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Best 300 cities

322
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
It's where many people do the same things you do

323
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:48,767
That's 300 cities were people in those 300 cities think they're the only ones who know about that

324
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,095
One place and 300 cities where people miss someone

325
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,167
One and one of Delta's other 299 cities

326
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,263
Delta isn't flying to 300 cities merely to bring people together

327
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,591
But to show that we're not that far apart in the first

328
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
Delta

329
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Keep climbing

330
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
Illmind has been a writer or producer on songs

331
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Drake

332
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Kanye West

333
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Cole

334
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,135
And each case each song is a little

335
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
But it is never

336
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
So a bunch of us went into a studio and made a song from

337
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,047
It's always more spread out than that

338
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
More technologically intermediate

339
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
What are the woman's favorites is a song that

340
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Jake hold

341
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
Called love yours

342
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
It's been streamed like

343
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,311
74 million times on Spotify

344
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
Thought an album that went double

345
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
Yo man told me the story of how that song

346
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
It was 2013

347
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,039
And a producer ill-minded meted a Beat battle years before

348
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,599
Email them a folder with a bunch of little piano

349
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Happens all the time

350
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,951
I'm so just another day they send me this piano Loop

351
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,887
This is the way music get Manor

352
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,727
Somebody in a room somewhere comes up with some little things

353
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
And thanks

354
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,103
Who do I know who might be able to to use this to work with it to create something

355
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,431
And so I added the strings in there

356
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:24,255
Canelo drumroll I added coming up

357
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
Don't mind doing all this just sitting at a desk playing a keyboard manipulating all those sounds on his laptop

358
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,415
And that's basically the beat

359
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
Real simple just straightforward

360
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
Didn't want to overdo it

361
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,071
How long did it take you to create a by 20 minutes

362
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
So in a day of work

363
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
Create one of those after another

364
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,519
Yep one after the other you know some days I'll spend

365
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,079
8 hours and I'll create maybe 10

366
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
10 track 10 lottery ticket

367
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,943
Like you said why do you call me

368
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
What mean

369
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
It is there lottery tickets because every

370
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,623
Every Beat every piece of music that I make has potential

371
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
To get placed somewhere

372
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,743
So their potential to make money but I mean most of them.

373
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,863
Don't write most of them don't most of them sit on a hard drive write ready to ready to make money though at some point

374
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
The email is open

375
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,215
The phone lines are open guys

376
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:43,615
What do you think you hear here in this part of the conversation I think is a big part of the reason you'll mind has been 6

377
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
It's because he thinks of himself

378
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,711
Not just as a musician or Purdue

379
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,551
Clearly he thinks of himself as running a small business

380
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
You Know It studio is just a room in the back of his apartment

381
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,439
There's a stack of books in there on the windowsill

382
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Their business

383
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,815
One of them is by a marketing professor at Wharton about how things go viral amazing book

384
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,911
This is my second time reading through it

385
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:11,007
Around being a producer who is famous among other producer

386
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
This summer he traveled to cities around the

387
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
And help these events where aspiring producers

388
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
Paid $250 each

389
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,735
Come sit in the studio with your mind

390
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,527
Play in their beef and get it

391
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319
I went to the one he had any

392
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,535
There's about 20 people crammed into this little studio in a kind of run-down building North

393
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
The Time Square

394
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
Someone call your name out

395
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
Basically you're going to come up

396
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
And plug the aux in

397
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
So I'm assuming people have their

398
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Computers phones

399
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
Where to plug in

400
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,359
Okay cool people come up one-by-one they introduce themselves

401
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,919
So what's your producer name I go by spice production

402
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
Spice production

403
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,295
I sent you a long-winded email while ago okay

404
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:00,927
You replied you know saying and that was big for me

405
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
And then spice Productions plays his music for Alma

406
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,711
Don't mind let's play for a minute or two

407
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Turns it off

408
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
Everybody applauds

409
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,135
And then don't mind Jesus t

410
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,975
In terms of the mix like the bass sound a little muddy

411
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
I think you just want to

412
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,047
Try to balance the

413
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Baseline

414
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,143
And the kick drum feedback with technical

415
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
What's up

416
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
I don't what kind of Motors you got

417
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,751
Yamaha's but I got the itis

418
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
Okay

419
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
I would I always say

420
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
This is kind of what I expect

421
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,759
But what's really surprising to me is that Ill Mind also gives a lot of basic business at

422
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,295
This isn't just

423
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,087
Polish up your beats with a beat making

424
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,111
This is

425
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
How to make it in the music

426
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
This horseshit that were trying to do here

427
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,023
Is to just like become successful right

428
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
And the only way to do that is to

429
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
Those guys out there that are mediocre that know everyone

430
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
And they're really cool

431
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
And

432
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,311
There's Executives that like being around them and they're getting every opportunity

433
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,127
But it's a dumb you know 5:10

434
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,175
15 years to nurture those relationship

435
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,295
So I think that's another misconception to get us producers is yellow like

436
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,903
My Beats are good enough my Beats are better than that person that person why am I not put on

437
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
What does you don't know

438
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
You didn't put five five years in

439
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
Like you know

440
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,887
Pulling up to the crib and watching football and get to know the person

441
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
You didn't do that

442
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
They did it

443
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
So he's getting a shot in your knee

444
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Does that make sense

445
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Yeah yeah

446
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,431
Don't mind didn't just become the producers

447
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
He spent decades

448
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503
Not just making music

449
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
But also

450
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
Becoming the guy who knows a guy

451
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:09,183
Which is why back in 2013 he got a call from someone he knew Indian

452
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,487
It's called me and he said hey

453
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,559
Yoel I work with J Cole

454
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,863
I'm wondering if you have any tracks for him

455
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,471
Immediately of that track that had started with the piano Loop those producers

456
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
Emailed it off and heard back like a week later

457
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
J Cole wants to use this on his neck

458
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Album

459
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,575
Ill Mind and the producer who sent him the piano Loop in the first place both got credited as producers and writers

460
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
Which means they get royalty

461
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,439
Here's the song it's it's a really special song so

462
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
It's called love yours here it is

463
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,303
Love yourz

464
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,679
Love yourz

465
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,543
No such thing

466
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,615
No sense

467
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:05,247
Love yourz

468
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
Note to self

469
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,135
There It Is Love yourz by J.Cole better song

470
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,671
20 20 minutes

471
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:17,023
In the studio just making music freely with no intention having fun

472
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
Which eventually

473
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,119
Got me a Grammy nomination and

474
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:27,775
Couple bucks

475
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,967
But the point is it wasn't just 20 minutes

476
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
In the studio

477
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,551
It's what he's been working on his entire adult life

478
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,351
