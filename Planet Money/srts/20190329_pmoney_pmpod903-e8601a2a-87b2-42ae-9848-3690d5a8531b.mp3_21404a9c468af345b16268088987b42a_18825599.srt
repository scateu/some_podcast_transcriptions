And instead of closing this Memorial Day we

9
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
The UPS Store

10
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,568
He's doing another thing

11
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
All together

12
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Opening

13
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
The UPS Store

14
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,176
Everything for small business

15
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,712
And of course shipping

16
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,784
Lauren Neuwirth is a junior at

17
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
Purdue

18
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,112
She studies biological engineering and

19
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
Food processing sign

20
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672
Is which means

21
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,488
She knows a lot about how Food Works

22
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:36,096
As a technical expert is there some artificial flavor that's just like where they just nailed it

23
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
I would say like banana bananas actually pretty cool from a chemical standpoint like a volatile account

24
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,032
Beastly is super pint

25
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
And she knew that Purdue was a good place to

26
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,152
Get into the food engineering industry

27
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,712
But you couldn't figure out how she was going to pay

28
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,248
Yeah it was

29
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:58,880
Extremely stressful like I was telling you before every time I go into financial aid I just start crying

30
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
Because

31
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,696
It's just so much money

32
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
And

33
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
Like I come from like a single-parent household

34
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,096
So it's hard to rationalize like

35
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,632
Asking my mom for like

36
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,424
Easter Bunny with Lauren went off.

37
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,240
Her mom gave her $30,000

38
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,776
That was her College

39
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,872
On top of that she was able to get some government back student loans

40
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
Niigata paid internships

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
In the summer

42
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,016
But all of those things combined are not nearly enough

43
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
To pay her way

44
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
So

45
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,112
I went to financial aid and I was like

46
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:35,232
All set to basically like joined the army because they said that they would pay for my school

47
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:43,168
Bruce Lee went in there and I was like okay I need some money or I'm calling Army recruiter back and I'm driving the Army B

48
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,240
Because I don't know what else to do in schools like 30 grand a year

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
And that was when someone at the financial aid office

50
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,128
Told her about a new way for students to pay for

51
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
It was so new

52
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,736
The even the person at the financial aid office

53
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
Didn't know all of it

54
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
Play sad like they didn't know a ton about it and that is kind of a new program and I should like go home and kind of looking

55
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Duet

56
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
Anna and I did

57
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,816
Yeah I think this does sound better than the military

58
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
So I

59
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,936
Applied and I got approved and then that's how it's been like

60
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
Paying for my last

61
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
2 years of school

62
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
Purdue gave Lauren a bunch of

63
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,080
Tens of thousands of

64
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,384
It's not a scholarships not alone

65
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
There's no set amount of money that Lauren has to pay back

66
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Instead

67
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:33,088
Lauren had to promise that she will give Purdue a chunk of her income

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
4 years after

69
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
She graduates

70
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
The more she makes

71
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440

This idea of selling stock in yourself

78
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
Or something like it

79
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
Has been kicking around for decades

80
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Now

81
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640

This thing Lauren Neuwirth

94
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,480
It is called an income share

95
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,040
It is a new way to help

96
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
College butt

97
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600

00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
Pre old id

99
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464
One of the people who helped kind of ReDiscover this

100
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
And dusted off

101
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
Is a man named

102
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Miguel Palacios

103
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Hello

104
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Jacob High

105
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
Hey Miguel how are you

106
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,704
Good thank you how are you tell is a professor of Finance at the University

107
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
Calgary

108
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
He grew up in Columbia

109
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
It in the mid-1990s

110
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
He heard about this weird thing happening

111
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
In the news

112
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
Involving

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
David Bowie

114
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,528
You must have done so

115
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,576
David Bowie race capital

116
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
For himself

117
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm at the special thing about this Capital racing was that he pledged his future earnings

118
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
This was in 1990s

119
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,607
And by this point David Bowie had been a rock

120
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Rockstar for life

121
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
30 years

122
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,935
He had this huge catalog

123
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Perpetual

124
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Under pressure

125
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
Starman The Man Who Sold the World and every time somebody

126
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
He bought an album or played one of those songs on the radio

127
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
But we got a little

128
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
He got royalty

129
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
So what but we decided to do at this

130
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,391
What's instead of get a little money every year

131
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
He wanted a lot of money

132
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Now

133
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
Joey said to invest

134
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
If you give me a lot of money now

135
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
I will give you a chunk of my royalties

136
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
For the next ten

137
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
And

138
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
It works

139
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,031
Investors gave Bowie 55 million dollars

140
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,615
And in return they got a nice steady stream of income for the next decade

141
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,431
When Miguel Palacios heard about this Bowie

142
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
He thought immediately

143
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,551
But this kind of deal would be great not just for rockstars

144
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
But for regular people

145
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
In particular

146
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
He thought a college

147
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,743
It all came from experiencing the

148
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:26,143
Fate of several classmates when I was an undergrad student who are doing okay but basically had to

149
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
To drop off

150
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Because they couldn't

151
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Survive financially

152
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,383
These people I knew they were highly capable they were very talented they were they were

153
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
Possibly much more talented than I was

154
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
And they were giving up

155
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
On a degree that it done in Colombia

156
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,831
Very very Valentine

157
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
So you heard about the Bowie bonds

158
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,207
And you thought about your your friends or classmates who

159
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,559
Had had to drop out because they didn't have enough money and I'm what did you think

160
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
I thought

161
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,911
They should be able to do something like what David Bowie

162
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Not exactly

163
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,215
Like what David Bowie

164
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
Dead but Miguel wanted to give college students

165
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
Choice big companies that had 400

166
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
If your company

167
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,687
And you need money you basically have two options

168
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
Option number one

169
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Debt

170
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
Get a loan sell Bond

171
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,111
If you do this you have to pay back everything you borrowed

172
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
Plus interest

173
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Option 2

174
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Equity

175
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
Sell stock to invest

176
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
If you do this investors

177
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
People

178
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
Give you money

179
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
And you get to keep

180
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
Is not alone

181
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
You don't have to

182
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
To pay it back

183
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,751
But the people who gave you the money who invested in you

184
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
Get a share of your future profit

185
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,591
The more money you make

186
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
The more money you have to give

187
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
Ordinary People don't have this

188
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
If your regular person

189
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,039
And you need money all you get is option one

190
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
You can borrow money if somebody is willing to lend it

191
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
If you don't want to borrow money

192
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,487
Or if there's nobody who is willing to lend you money

193
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,351
You're out of luck that is why Miguel's friends who couldn't get loans had to drop out of

194
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Sao Miguel keep studying this idea

195
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
He goes off to grad school

196
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,287
And you learned that people have tried sort of similar things in the past but

197
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
But not really what Migo was thing

198
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,431
He also finds a couple people trying to get companies off the ground

199
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
90s butt

200
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
Nobody's getting very far

201
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
And at some point Miguel happens

202
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
To come across this chapter in a book by Milton

203
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
The famous icon

204
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Randomly

205
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
So I was

206
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Reading

207
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
Capitalism and freedom

208
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,935
And it was there right so there's this this chapter and there it is

209
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
It's light out

210
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Very clearly

211
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
The whole idea of explain

212
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
Freeman just says it

213
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,639
We should have a way that you can give a student money

214
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,431
In exchange for a cut

215
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
Of his or her future

216
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,295
So you just happened to be reading this book at this moment

217
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Yes

218
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Serendipity

219
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
What did you think when you came upon this in the book

220
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
Cool things

221
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
On 100

222
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,023
I guess it's not an original idea

223
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
On the other hand

224
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:10,495
Milton Friedman also thought it was a good idea yeah yeah the big moment for Miguel

225
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,055
When you met a guy named Felipe Vergara

226
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
Also Colombian

227
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
Very entrepreneurial

228
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
And interested in education

229
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,711
Describe what I was

230
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
Writing about

231
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
I'm sure she thought it was

232
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Very interesting

233
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
And but

234
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,415
This is worthy intrapreneurs different from the PhD

235
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Student

236
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,583
I was thinking that I would spend several years studying and learning and then designing

237
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,423
I'm she said why don't we do it let's try to have the first contract by next month

238
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,799
That was the birth of Looney Looney is the company that Felipe and Miguel found

239
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,103
Wanted to do this thing Miguel have been dreaming of

240
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,407
To make income share agreements

241
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
For students

242
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,015
They did all pilot program in Chile Where Miguel at work when he was in

243
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
2606 students

244
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
$10,000

245
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
Well that was great

246
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
And that

247
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:03,487
West say the first the beginnings of a track record

248
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,839
That allowed them need to start raising more Capital to finance other students

249
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
That was in 2001

250
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
Today almost 20 years later

251
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,519
It operates in Colombia Peru Chile

252
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:20,639
Mexico to this point something of a 10000 student finance

253
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Movies counter

254
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
In all they provided about 50 million dollars

255
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
500 in

256
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
And the investors who put money in they are getting paid

257
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
But

258
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
Lumi is not really

Alright one moment he saw the meeting right now one moment please

282
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,775
Media who were taking note

283
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,335
Purdue received a record number of applicants

284
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:28,735
Purdue University remember is the school that is using an income share agreement to fund part of the education of Lauryn or

285
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
The food engineer who we talk to

286
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,647
Whatever your Pursuit McDaniel McDaniels is the president

Highest chicken Goldstein at NPR

288
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
4-year University in the US

289
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
To try income share

290
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
And this happened because

291
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
In 2015

292
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
Mitch Daniels went to wash

293
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
In to testify at

294
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
At a congressional hearing on higher ed

295
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
You talk about a bunch of different issue

296
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
Use and just passing

297
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
He mentioned income share

298
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:03,551
I was almost a throwaway line but as soon as the

299
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:08,159
Hearing was over I was swarmed with the first of all reporters were curious about the

300
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,183
Concept

301
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
And then shortly thereafter I began to hear from people who had hoped that somewhere someone would try to get this

302
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
The concept airborne

303
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,167
Beachwood back to Purdue

304
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
And ask the team of

305
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Figure out if

306
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,287
Could do this and if so

307
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
What students might be

308
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
Address to beat Super clear here

309
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
Step back for 1

310
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
College is ridiculously expensive

311
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
Income share agreements

312
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Are not going to solve that

313
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,599
Also there are better ways to

314
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
The pay for college

315
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
If you can swing them

316
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,255
Government-backed student loans are better than income share agreements for most

317
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
Also

318
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Grants and scholarships

319
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,143
Are obviously better for students than income share agreement

320

Play 4 lotto

321
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Students like Lorde net worth

322
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
Grants and scholarships

323
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
Government-backed loans and summer jobs

324
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,615
All put together are not enough to pay for

325
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,383
For college

326
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,223
Those students often wind up taking out additional private loans

327
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
And for those students

328
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Purdue decided

329
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
Income share agreements might be a good

330
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,903
All I know is there are millions of students

331
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:17,279
Who are taking very expensive loans who might be candidates for this and let who might

332
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Find it to their advantage

333
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
Purdue launched its income share

334
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,423
MIT program in 2016

335
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
So far they funded about 500

336
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,847
And the details of how this program works

337
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Are really into

338
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:38,527
We're just going to run through some of those details to explain how it actually works for students like

339
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Say Lauren new

340
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:45,951
I like printed out all my forms that I signed and everything last night I was kind of like what you have

341
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
The school gave Lauren

342
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
$50,000

343
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
And she promised to pay roughly

344
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,631
The 15% of her in

345
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
For eight years after she

346
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
So the more you make

347
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
The more you have to pay

348
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Yes

349
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,615
But also the less you make the less you have to pay

350
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:10,015
But I mean we're hoping to make a good amount of money what are the most interesting things about the program is that the percentage

351
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
Picture of income that students have to promise to

352
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
The pay depends on what their major

353
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
We talked about this with Mary Claire Cartwright who manages the

354
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,071
And we know that a chemical Engineers traditional salary

355
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:29,215
I'm out of school is going to be different than let's say an English major and then by different human way higher

356
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,287
Correct me for most people right

357
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,103
Right here is the thinking behind how

358
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
Mapreduce at this

359
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,199
They want everybody who participates

360
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
The ultimately pay back the same

361
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,807
Now English majors are probably going to earn

362
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Unless

363
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,111
So if they want money now

364
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
They have to promise

365
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
A higher percentage of

366
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
On the other hand Engineers are probably going to earn more

367
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
So they are on the hook for a lower percentage

368
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Did you verify

369
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,703
Feels like I don't know a little weird make a little judgy

370
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,799
Most schools for example don't charge different tuition rates for different

371
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,127
They just set one average for everybody

372
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,175
So why not do that

373
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
With income share

374
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,039
So you could you could decide to just take the average income of all

375
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
We're going to charge you based on that

376
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
That's an option

377
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
It is

378
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:29,375
But it would be one that might cause there to be more adverse selection into the cohort

379
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:35,775
You mean that if you if you ever doubt all the English Majors would say like sure that sounds like a sweet deal ready to chemical energy

380
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,103
You doing they just be like nothing

381
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
Right correct haha

382
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
That's interesting

383
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,759
Adverse selection is this General kind of problem that

384
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
Occurs when

385
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,087
Exactly the wrong kind of

386
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
People sign up

387
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,439
And one concerned with income share agreements

388
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,023
Is it even when you charge different Majors different rates

389
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
You could still have this adverse selection

390
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
Yeah like say I'm an English major

391
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,655
And I'm planning to go to Las

392
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
And get some high paying lawyer

393
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
I'm going to make a lot more than the average English me

394
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
So for me

395
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,151
An income share agreement is probably not a good deal right I'm going to be on the hook for a lot of money

396
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,479
On the other hand if I'm going to go say you know be a teacher get a

397
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,295
Get a good job but when where I don't make a ton of money

398
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,111
In that case on income share agreement may be a good deal for me

399
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,903
The Purdue doesn't have any

400
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
Control over what you do after you

401
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
They're not going to tell you

402
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,815
To take the higher-paying job over a lower-paying job

403
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
But there are some

404
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,143
Terms in the contract to catch

405
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
You know like super slacker

406
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,727
I mean if someone told me like

407
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
You're going to pay a percentage of your income

408
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
For the ten years after you graduate

409
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,359
I would initially be like great

410
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
So I'm going to Europe

411
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
For at least two of those years

412
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Great

413
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,367
You know we want people to experience that and you pause the contract because you're not

414
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,927
You're not seeking employment pause the con

415
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
The students will do this

416
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
That's the students

417
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
Like Lauren

418
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Debt income share

419
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,119
Are on the hook for 8 years after they grow

420
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,679
It's like there's this clock running down

421
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:14,079
But pretty will stop the clock if the students if they Lauren decides to know to bum around Europe or for that matter to go to

422
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
On the other hand

423
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,455
If Lauren gets fired and she's looking for a job

424
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
The clock keeps running

425
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
And since she doesn't have income

426
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
She doesn't have to pay

427
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
On the

428
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
Other

429
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
I guess other hand

430
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
If Lauren becomes

431
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
You know what some food

432
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,511
Text superstars who becomes

433
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Banana in a billionaire

434
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,655
She does not have to kick back 15% of that huge windfall to

435
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
I predict she does not have to give them

436
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
Whatever a hundred million dollars

437
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
There is a cap

438
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
On what she and everybody in the program has two

439
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
And that captives

440
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,687
Two and a half times the amount that Purdue gave her in the

441
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Lawrence KS

442
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
It's a hundred and twenty five thousand

443
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
After she graduates

444
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
She'll have to tell Purdue

445
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
Or the company that's running the

446
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Yes program

447
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Purdue

448
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
How much she is May

449
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
Edible oranges

450
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
Uses to pay

451
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,583
They can come after her and demanded that she pay

452
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
Two and a half times the amount

453
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
They gave her in the first

454
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
No matter how much she's making a

455
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
So those

456
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
Are some of the terms

457
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
The terms that

458
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
Lauren Neuwirth sign

459
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
How do you feel

460
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
All

461
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
I mean honestly not great

462
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Because

463
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,807
Like no one wants money taken out of their check every month

464
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:34,207
But at the same time like maybe I don't make a lot coming out of college okay well then we're still doing fine I'm not going to like

465
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Default on my loan

466
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,559
The first students in the program have already graduated

467
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
They're making payments

468
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Seems to be going well

469
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
But really it is too early to say how this is going

470
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,847
Ghetto will students like Lauren feel good about it in the end will the people who put money into the program get their money back

471
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
How profitable

472
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,687
Will it be the kind of thing that draws in

473
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,271
Big money private investors or is it going to remain this kind of

474
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
Semi philanthropic niche

475
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
But for sure

476
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
Income share Agreements are a thing now

477
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
They're popular with vocational schools

478
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Coding bootcamps

479
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071

00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,655
Utah Colorado Pennsylvania in New York

481
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
Are all launching their own

482
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Income share agreement

Does that mean you were like tasting the chocolate

Yes and I know exactly what you're talking about because that's

500
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,343
It's literally what I did in French
