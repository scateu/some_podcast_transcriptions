Right around the corner from Darth Vader

86
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
Where we stand now what are we looking

87
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
Are you looking at Santa Claus costumes

88
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
A lot of

89
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,080
A lot of different Daredevil qualities in price level

90
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
Despite / Santa suits

91
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,712
Please out on this wall right in front of us on this wall of Santa suit

92
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
It's right in front of

93
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
And it's a fight over

94
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
Most of the suits are made of

95
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Mercy's mark

96
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
Imports them and of course

97
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
When he supports them

98
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Just bring through customs

99
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,280
And depending on what he's important sometimes he has to pay a tariff

100
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Whether he has to pay

101
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
He that tariff

102
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
And how much she has to

103
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Hey is laid out in the

104
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
Harmonized tariff schedule

105
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
The United States

106
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
Harmonized tariff schedule

107
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,823
It is 99 chapters long and it was

108
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,847
Tens of thousands

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
But it doesn't list ever

110
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,991
There is no line item that says costumes or Santa

111
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
So there has been this long-running

112
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
Where do costumes belong

113
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
In the Tariff

114
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,671
Mark beige hasn't answered today

115
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Question is

116
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
There is a section of

117
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,791
Section 9505 to be precise

118
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
That is perfect for centos

119
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
It's called festive articles

120
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,191
I printed out the page here you could just read some of the stuff in

121
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Okay

122
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
Christmas ornaments of glass

123
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Of wood

124
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,847
Nativity scenes and figures thereof

125
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
Artificial Christmas tree

126
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,223
It's not just Christmas stuff this section also include stuff like party favors in

127
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Fetty and

128
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
Streamers and all this

129
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
The festive articles

130
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
Come into the country Duty

131
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
Free notepad

132
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,207
Mark Imports costume so of course duty free is good for you

133
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:23,071
And according to the government some Santa suit like the cheap ones in front of us in the store

134
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,119
There is no question they are Festival

135
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,679
Made out of a yellow flannel type of fabric

136
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,471
Sabacc close with velcro

137
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
This one is effective article

138
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,311
But then Mark showed me a difference

139
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
Display a nicer

140
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,431
What has a b c d

141
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,479
The pants look like

142
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,319
That made out of a plush material

143
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,367
You have a jacket witch

144
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,183
Has a white fur cuffs

145
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,303
White fur, it's got this nice lining Customs looks at this nice or Santa suit

146
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
Incest mark

147
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
This is not a festive article

148
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
You made this so nice

149
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
This is

150
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
And clothes go under a different part of the

151
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,543
Import this suit

152
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Mark has to pee

153
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
32% tax

154
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
The jacket

155
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
Add a 29.2% tax

156
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,015
There's a pair of gloves in a white Santa gloves those committed

157
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
10%

158
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
And Mark thinks this whole thing is ridiculous

159
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
It's a Santa suit

160
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,927
Clearly it's a festival

161
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
This is the epitome of a

162
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
About Festival

163
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
Let me know when else

164
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
Oberlin Christmas are you going to wear this

165
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:34,239
It's nice I can put on this red bird jacket it's a little bit chilly today that's like the perfect weight

166
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
50 degree weather

167
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,871
Right but what is the last time you went around dresses and Santa Claus

168
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,711
Calling the Santa suit clothes Mark says makes it a lot more

169
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Kim and

170
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
Yeah of course so if you were going to pay

171
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
Pay $80 for a Santa suit for instance

172
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,951
10 or $15 of that $80

173
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
Would be

174
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
There is a lawsuit over this

175
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,095
Scituate lawsuit over the question of what is

176
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Fantasy

177
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:05,215
The person bringing the lawsuit is him it's markbass the suit

178
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Is Ruby Acosta

179
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
Company versus the United

180
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,359
Basically Mark playing government come on

181
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Santa suit is a festival

182
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
But when I ask Mark about the lawsuit

183
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015
He doesn't want to get into the detail

184
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,575
He actually points for this guy in a suit and tie

185
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,855
Who's been following us around the Sun

186
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
His lawyer

187
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,415
Let's jump Essex

Custom special power attorney for many many years

189
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,143
How did we get to a world where a lawyer needs to be present to have a conversation about a saint

190
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
And I don't even

191
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
I actually called up an expert

192
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,055
Douglas Irwin an economic historian

193
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
And he says

194
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
The story starts

195
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
With the beginning of the US government

196
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,551
Actually the second piece of legislation passed by Congress in 1789

197
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Was

198
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
Pure Flix

199
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
Second second law Congress ever pass

200
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
Ever yes

201
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Will the Tariff

202
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
On what

203
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Xiamen

204
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
Everything he was in his office when I

205
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,351
As far as I can tell over the phone

206
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
Every copy of the

207
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
Tariff code ever written kind of

208
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
At hand

209
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,567
He said back then back in 1789 the Tariff code was simple imagine that's cuz they just weren't

210
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,919
That many different things in the world to know like everything is so much

211
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
That much

212
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Stuff

213
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
From that first

214
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,783
He said it's just three pages

215
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
Distilled spirits

216
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
Molasses malt

217
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,415
Cast iron all-weather Candor Todd

218
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
All clothing ready-made

219
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
7/2 percenter there it is

220
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:37,631
Someone says there's a simple reason that this was the second law Congress ever passed

221
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
The government needed the money

222
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
There was no income

223
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,311
But there were Ships. Coming into Boston to New York

224
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,383
Charleston and soap the government looks at those ships and that all right

225
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
You want to come here

226
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
Give us some money

227
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
That first tariff

228
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Didn't mention Fest

229
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Articles

230
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,527
There wasn't much of a fee

231
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
Best of article industry

232
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,135
So Douglas Irwin started going back through old tariff

233
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
Looking for when festive articles first

234
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
Eventually you got to 1920

235
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
Oh

236
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,071
I think festooning is best of articles

237
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
Okay here's what it says

238
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:13,727
Doll heads toy marbles toy games toy containers toy favors toy souvenirs

239
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
Garland festooning

240
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
And Christmas tree decorations

241
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Ferrets

242
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
That's what becomes Festival

243
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,943
The Tariff code is getting bigger and bigger and more and more

244
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:27,295
Complex goes from that original three pages to if I've got it right I think now it's

245
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
3000

246
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
681 page

247
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,463
But in all those pages there is no line for costume

248
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
Now you have these

249
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,023
Two categories

250
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
Is it costumes make

251
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
If they're closed then you have to pay it

252
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
If their festive articles

253
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Notary

254
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
And as a result of this

255
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,007
You have this endless fight that is been going on

256
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,871
And who was on the other side of this fight who in the world was arguing that

257
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Santa suit

258
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
And costumes

259
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,503
Foreclosed the answer is pretty pretty fun pretty delightful

260
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
Back in the 90s on the other side was

261
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
Markbass

262
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
What's Ruby's cast

263
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,903
He has completely switched

264
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,487
And you were on the other side then right absolutely

265
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
You know it's

266
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
Good to be flexible

267
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:18,239
You're going to get right it's like you didn't seem ashamed of it at all he's clearly not like a philosopher of the Tariff

268
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,311
Cody's not arguing over the metaphysics of Santa suits he's a businessman

269
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
I'm back in the 90s when he was on the opposite side

270
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,015
He was in a pretty different business at that time he was not importing costumes you were making them here in the United States

271
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
We worry domestic

272
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:36,159
100% domestic manufacturer and of course if your domestic manufacturer if you're making

273
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Costumes

274
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
Country you want

275
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
Importers that have to pay a tariff

276
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Mixer costumes

277
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,887
So that is why markbass was on the other side and government has also

278
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Flip-flopped on this

279
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,727
Miss you a lot in the last few years a lot of the costumes that you

280
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Categorized

281
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
As festive articles

282
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
The government has changed its mind

283
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,639
No actually those are closed

284
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,967
I also asked Customs about this I said you know why why are you making

285
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Change

286
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,831
They didn't comment but Mark's lawyer the guy who was with us he used to work for

287
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
And he said you know

288
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
Customs

289
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Mostly just a bunch of

290
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
People trying their best to put things into categories

291
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Ways to follow the rules

292
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,143
The categories aren't all we clear the people working at Customs change and new people come in and they say you know

293
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,983
That's an issue that we used to color festival I think it's actually

294
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
And here is why the story is about more than

295
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
Santa suits

296
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,687
Santa suits are one little fight in one little corner of the Tariff code and the Tariff code is

297
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Is Giant

298
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
These thousands of pages long.

299
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
Tons of complicated rules

300
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
And where there are complicated rules

301
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Money at stake

302
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,927
There are people for hire who will help you figure out

303
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
How to play the game

304
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
It's called tariff engineer

305
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,839
Harris engineering yes that's a real thing though it's a huge that you are a tariff engineer

306
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
Sure absolutely

307
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,703
This is Michael Cohen engineer and trade lawyer

308
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:58,079
Terpening is not just suing the government arguing that something should be in one category or another

309
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,663
It's figuring out how companies can build things different

310
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,223
How they can actually tweak their products

311
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
So that they get a better deal in the Tariff

312
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,927
There's one really famous example where a Shoe Company Incorporated some kind of fabric into the sole of a shoe

313
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
Just move the shoe from one tariff category

314
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
There's a similar

315
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
Kind of trick with costumes and that is

316
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,679
You use a velcro closure instead of the zipper or button

317
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
It's less likely to

318
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
Carter's clothing more likely to be gay

319
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
Effective article duty free

320
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:32,639
In fact a festive articles have been a big deal in his world it's not just costume

321
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,967
I mean there been cases for years over you know if you have a

322
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,527
A mug or a placemat or tablecloth

323
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:44,671
And you put a jack o'lantern or Santa Claus on it does it count as a mug replacement or tablecloth or is it effective article

324
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
And there are other things that you don't

325
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:51,583
One client came to Michael Cohn and wanted to import this big industrial machine

326
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,399
Emcon figured out if you split up the machine in

327
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,727
Two separate parts base we take it apart

328
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Live It Up

329
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
Two separate shipment

330
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,567
Right on two separate ships

331
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
Come pick it up at the Tariff would be a lot

332
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Lower

333
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
There was a lot cheaper

334
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,479
More than paid for myself

335
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:13,599
This is totally legal and it is a totally logical response to a tariff code that has

336
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Tens of thousands

337
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,391
Line items

338
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
And different tariffs for each one

339
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Yeah but obviously it doesn't

340
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
Feel good right it's logical but if you step back

341
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
You don't look at the work

342
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:27,167
Cone is doing here it's not doing anything for economy right I mean

343
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,775
We want to company spending time and money figuring out what is the best machine we can buy

344
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:36,127
Or what does costume actually be better with a zipper or with belt

345
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
Pinboys justify

346
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
Figure out how to minimize your toy

347
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
Sheriff Billy doesn't make our products better

348
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
I know you don't want to ask

349
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,367
Would we be better off if your job went away

350
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,183
That the very painful answer is

351
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
For real you really think that

352
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Sure

353
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,911
Most Economist agree that the benefits of tariffs and trade barriers are greatly outweighed by

354
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
The cost of them

355
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
And most tariffs have

356
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
Either going to be completely orgone way.

357
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,383
Back in the 1960s for example the average tariff on the stuff we imported was around 7%

358
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
Today it's one and a half for

359
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
But the Tariff code is still a big complicate

360
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
Poker rules

361
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
And the case over the Santa suit

362
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,367
Rubie's Costume Company versus United States

363
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,903
It is likely to go to trial neck

364
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
You can picture in your mind a courtroom

365
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
And there's John desik rubies

366
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
Customs lawyer

367
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
Pointing at a red plush Santa suit and

368
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Telling the judge

369
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Festive article

370

371
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Swearing

372
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Close

373
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,127
The lawsuit is over a particular suit it's over the premier plush nine-piece sand

374
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,991
Which of course I tried to buy when I went out to meet Market Ruby's of course

375
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
I think this is

376
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
Say my name

377
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647

00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
Don't have the beard or the wig or the plush Red Sea

385
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,799
And now it is 2017 and earlier this year

00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
In fact on Halloween

387
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
