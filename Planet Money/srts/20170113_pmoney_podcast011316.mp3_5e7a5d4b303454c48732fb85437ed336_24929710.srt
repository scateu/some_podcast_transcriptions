00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,568
He's doing another thing

11
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
All together

12
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Opening

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
The UPS Store

And of course shipping

16
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,040
Steve flatow is a real estate lawyer

17
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:28,416
He works on the ground floor of an anonymous office building in New Jersey he's got a big messy desk

18
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,976
And when he sits in his desk and looks to the left

19
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,512
CFCs family photos

20
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
His kids

21
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,816
16 grandkids

22
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,840
At weddings

23
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,400
Disney World bar mitzvahs Bat Mitzvahs

24
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
On the opposite wall there's a

25
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,728
Picture of his daughter Alice

26
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
She has curly brown hair and

27
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,800
Deep dimples like Steve

28
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,384
And he says when Lisa was a teenager she was very smart

29
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
And she was very generous

30
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968
And she's also very stubborn

31
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,552
He remembers one night she got invited to a party way out on Long Island

32
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
And

33
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,600
It was snowing

34
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,416
And the prediction was it was going to get worse

35
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:06,816
So I couldn't see myself driving an hour and 45 minutes to Long Island and then turn around

36
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
And come back in a blizzard

37
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Well

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Histrionic

39
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:16,800
But missing the party I think she spoke to me for a day is fine I could use the peace and quiet

40
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,640
In the spring of 95 Eliza was 20 a junior in college

41
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,688
She was studying abroad in Israel

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
And one day she called her parents

43
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,784
She told us she was going

44
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
On vacation

45
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,344
Spring break basic

46
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,184
Steve reminded her of the Flatow Family Travel rules

47
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,256
Number one no hitchhiking take the bus

48
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,816
Number to never travel alone

49
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
And number three

50
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
Let me know where you're going to be

51
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
When I asked her where she was going she told me gusta teeth

52
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
I don't know where it was

53
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
And then I asked if you told me Gaza

54
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:54,176
The Gaza Strip and narrow Palestinian territory along the Mediterranean Coast

55
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:59,040
Not the safest place in the world but he thought like she knows what she's doing

56
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
She's been to Israel six times

57
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
She's been working hard all semester

58
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:08,256
So instead of yelling Adam told me she couldn't go until I wished her well into the koalas and 3 days when she returns

59
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,840
Next morning around 8 CE was running late for synagogue

60
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
He jumped into the car and was backing out into the

61
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,472
Street and put the radio on in the news came on a bus bombing

62
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
And Gaza

63
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
A bus bombing

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
And this

65
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
Insane and

66
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,896
Terrible thought flashed through his head

67
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
Eliza was on that bus

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,736
I just felt it in my bones

69
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
I didn't hear the explosion

70
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,368
I didn't hear the sound that metal make sense for from the side of a bus

71
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,696
I did not hear cries of pain I just know it

72
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
His wife called a few minutes later

73
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,280
He was right

74
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
That afternoon he food is real

75
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
Eliza was in a hospital in a coma

76
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
And he held her hand

77
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
He was thinking that if she heard his voice

78
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
She wake up

79
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:55,616
I squeezed your hand and whispered in my ear that everything will be okay quotes Daddy was here

80
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,432
But when I click over here and it just fell into the side of the bed

81
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
She never woke up

82
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
And later on

83
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,624
Steve would learn what happened from the state department and from Israeli investigators

84
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,720
On the morning of April 9th 1995 Elisa boarded a bus

85
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
From Ashkelon Israel headed to

86
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Tu casa

87
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
At noon she was dozing off

88
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,168
About 5 minutes afternoon a suicide bomber in a van loaded with a

89
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:19,936
Explosives

90
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Drove into the bus

91
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
The bus

92
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,056
Exploded Elisa jumped up like out of a bad dream

93
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
And then she sent back down in her seat

94
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,688
Piece of shrapnel had pierced her skull and lodged in her brain

95
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
Steve flu her body back home

96
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
Man after the funeral

97
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
He grieved

98
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
He and his wife tried a bereavement

99
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
Her parents

100
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:44,000
And we said at least it was murdered terror attack people like that they gasped

101
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,072
It's a lot of the time he ended up grieving alone

102
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,144
People don't know what to do first of all you don't know what to say

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
So don't be near you

104
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
Second of all the years of

105
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
Fear that I might rub off somehow

106
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,152
There's no third reason people just don't know how to react to the death of a child

107
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,808
The man who blew up elise's bus with a member of a group called Palestinian Islamic

108
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
Jihad small group

109
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:14,720
But the US state department believes this group got funding from the government of Iran

110
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
And they told Steve is my

111
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,911
Steve Flatow of suburban New Jersey decided

112
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
He was going to war with Iran

113
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,007
To get Justice for his daughter

114
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,407
I wanted to send a message to the Iranian that you cannot take an innocent life and not pay it back

115
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:40,575
I'm Noel King and today I'm Planet Money we have the story of Steve Flatow swore

116
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,391
It was a war a lot of people didn't want fought

117
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,279
Billions of dollars and some of the most tenuous diplomatic relationships in the world where it's steak

118
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,351
And it's a war whose outcome is still echoing today

119

125
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
Steve Flatow was not the president

126
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
He could not start an actual war with Iran

127
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
He is a lawyer

128
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
And lawyers Sue

129
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
But he couldn't Sue Iran

130
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
Because of a US law called the foreign

131
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,847
Sovereign immunities Act

132
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,175
This loss is a US citizen can't sue a country

133
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:44,319
What's been around since the 1970s but its roots go way back to the divine right of

134
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
Kings The Sovereign the

135
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
The king is always right

136
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:47,903
You can't sue him

137
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,439
Countries are like that

138
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
But Steve Flatow got lucky

139
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:57,119
Because another man another lawyer down in Washington DC had been looking for an opportunity

140
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
Bust a hole in the

141
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,959
My name is Steven Robert

142
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
Perlis

143
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,847
And I am a practitioner of international reparations law

144
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,175
Ce4less is a big player in this corner of the legal world

145
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,247
You know how we all have annoying workplace stories like

146
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,831
Somebody use my coffee mug or somebody parked in my spot

147
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,391
Steve Harless is workplace stories are like

148
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:24,255
One time I was in Libya and the police thought my toothbrush was a weapon and they tried

149
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
Confiscated

150
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
Biryani and Parliament called me a snake

151
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,191
I am not going to pay run on vacation next year

152
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,287
Deeper less as far as I can tell is a professional obsessive

153
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,871
And in the mid-90s he was obsessed with the law that says

154
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,663
US citizens can sue country

155
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,479
He was specifically obsessed with

156
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,295
Exceptions to the law there are a handful of them

157
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
And most of them cover commercial

158
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,439
To say that the French Embassy here in New York hires me to

159
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Paint their walls

160
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,255
And I do it and I do a good job

161
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
And they won't pay me

162
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,583
Well I can turn around and Sue France

163
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
D'aprile is wanted another exception

164
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,007
One that would allow us victims of Terror to sue the country's response

165
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
At some point

166
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,359
A foreign sovereign

167
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Conduct

168
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,223
These are the US national become so noxious

169
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,063
That that Sovereign has no expectation of immunity

170
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
These countries

171
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
I have behaved

172
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
So badly

173
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
If they don't get

174
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
To be immune

175
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
That is correct

176
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
This argument made sense to Congress

177
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,887
And in the mid-90s Congress added another except

178
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,495
It said Americans who were victims of Terror could sue country

179
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
But the exception was very vague especially on the question of money

180
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Could American citizens

181
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,687
Sue countries and win money

182
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
Steve Perlis wanted it to be clear that they could

183
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
And then as he remembers it

184
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
One day

185
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
He was in the office

186
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,903
The phone rang

187
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
And there was a man on the other end

188
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
He said

189
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Tumi

190
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
My name is Steve Flatow

191
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
Do you know

192
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
Who I am

193
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:10,751
And I said yes your daughter was killed and Israel they talked and Steve Pearl has realized that

194
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
In this broken hearted father he had found a

195
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,335
Perfect

196
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Test case

197
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,943
A man who wanted to see what country and wanted to win money

198
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
For a reason

199
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
Kirstie Floyd

200
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,087
I saw it as a way to possibly put the Iranians out of the terrorism business

201
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Fat

202
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Big

203
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
Put the Iranians out of the terror business

204
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,303
That's not a small countries have bottom lines also

205
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:39,679
The goal was to make their lives so miserable that they would say

206
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
We're done

207
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,799
In the summer of 1996 the two men went to Capitol Hill

208
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,127
And they knocked on doors hundreds of doors of Congress

209
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
People

210
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
And here was their pitch

211
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
Let's say you let

212
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Steve Flatow Surat

213
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
Let's say he wins

214
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
Let's say he wins a lot

215
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:01,439
Well maybe we can make it too expensive for Ron to be in the business of blowing up bus

216
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
And their pitch work

217
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,815
President Bill Clinton clarify the law to say

218
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,655
If an American could prove a country was responsible for an act of Terror

219
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
They could sue

220
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
And they could win damages

221
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
It didn't apply to all countries

222
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
He's just a handful

223
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,871
Ones that the US designated State sponsors of Terror

224
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Iran was one of those

225
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
SNL Steve and his team had to

226
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Prove that it wrong

227
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Did this

228
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,087
Veteran had given money and support to the group that killed Elisa

229
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,695
To do this they called up an American Economist named Patrick

230
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Clawson

231
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:39,071
Clawson has a skill that's kind of an unusual skill for an American economist

232
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
How do you say good morning in Farsi

233
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,959
Silver hair

234
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
He speaks and reads

235
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,031
Farsi fluently

236
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,383
He learned it when he was doing his PhD thesis in Iran's Economic Development

237
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
I said that if I'm going to be taken seriously by people who study Iran got to learn the language and so I threw my

238
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Myself into it

239
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,135
And I discovered I loved it loved it so much that

240
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,975
At the time he was reading 5 Iranian newspapers in Farsi everyday

241
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
And in the mid-90s the Iranians

242
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:14,911
Kind of mind-blowing Lee actually publish their National budget in the newspaper

243
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,495
So one day I was reading a really boring

244
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,335
I came across this line I fell off my chair I said why don't you mean

245
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:27,199
Way down at the bottom under the budget lines for tourism and infrastructure

246
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
Was a line item for

247
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Support

248
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
Tutera group

249
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,831
Including Palestinian Islamic

250
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,695
What idiot is going to put down in their budget as approved by the parliament

251
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,487
Providing financial support

252
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
44 Terrace

253
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Baby just wrote it in there

254
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
Yats

255
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
This was the proof Steve Plato's legal team needed

256
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,935
They serve dinner on papers

257
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,727
They sent them in the mail to tayron

258
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
The papers were mailed back

259
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
The envelope

260
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Clearly been steamed open

261
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,895
There was a mini freak-out at the Law Offices of Steven curless

262
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,735
Football squad look at the package to make sure that it wasn't

263
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Mind with anything

264
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
It wasn't a bomb

265
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,367
In fact there was no response

266
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,415
And one Fleet / Citron went

267
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
To trial in DC

268
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
AC in 1998 it was

269
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
Play-Doh versus and empty

270
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
Teach are there on didn't show up

271
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,143
Plato's lawyers made their case to the judge

272
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,447
We want to put Iran out of the Terabithia

273
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,775
And we want you to award damages to help us do that

274
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:28,895
Three weeks after the trial the judge St fleta to come back to Washington for the verdict

275
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,943
He's back in front of the judge by 9 a.m.

276
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
He began to read his opinion

277
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,599
I found the Iranian government responsible for the murder of Alisa Flatow

278
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,903
And if we was answering a judgement

279
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,183
In favor of

280
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
The family

281
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
For approximately 24 million dollars

282
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,631
And Trinity of Damages approximate 225

283
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,239
225 million dollars

284
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
And the judge makes it really clear he says right there

285
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
I'm awarding you a quarter of a billion dollars

286
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
Punish Iran

287
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
To deter terrorists

288
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:08,575
I just slammed my hand on the table when I looked up at the ceiling and I said yes Eliza

289
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
I was astounded

290
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
And that we would never see that Columbia

291
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,303
Okay so here is the difference between Steve Flatow and his lawyer Steve Perla

292
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Deflate a thought he'd never see a nickel

293
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,935
The pearlettes on the other hand he was there too

294
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
And here's what was going through his mind

295
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,591
Okay now I've got a hunting license how do I go get that money

296
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
How do I go get that money

297
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:38,015
Well Iran hadn't recognized the lawsuit it wasn't going to turn over a quarter of a billion dollars

298
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,367
Iran in the US have been in the kind of cold war for decades

299
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:48,767
We cut diplomatic ties after summer Ronnie and students seized the US Embassy in Tehran and held Americans hostage

300
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,631
But Steve Perlis knew there were still a roni and Assets in the US

301
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
There was the Embassy in Washington

302
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,519
It was a big house that have been owned by the Ambassador also in DC

303
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,591
Deflator when is Warriors Got permission from the courts to

304
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
To seize those proper

305
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
And they went after them

306
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
That's when all hell broke loose

307
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
All hell broke loose because

308
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,039
There is another very powerful interest

309
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
The White House

310
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
And the White House Came Out Swinging

311
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:18,719
Everytime Steve's legal team identified a property and tried to seize it

312
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
The White House would drag him into

313
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
Court and put a stop

314
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,071
Steve remembers

315
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
Facing off against sometimes a dozen lawyers

316
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
I listen to all your nonsense

317
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:33,567
Your legal gobbledygook and how your Fairy of the quote allow us to proceed it with

318
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Upset

319
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Dumb

320
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,943
Vital relations you know foreign policy and

321
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,735
So why would the White House

322
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Do this

323
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Steve had one in court

324
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,135
Heated personal conversations with Bill Clinton about Eliza

325
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
He knew the president sympathize

326
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
Everyone sympathize

327
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:56,095
Stuart eizenstat was Deputy Secretary of the Treasury at the time he represented the White House

328
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,423
And a lot of times he was the one facing off against Steve's legal

329
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
He knew all about Eliza

330
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
It was really heart-wrenching

331
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,151
I have particular empathy for her because she was young Brandeis University student

332
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,223
Which happened to me my wife friends alma mater

333
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,063
But Stu has spent many years in government and in diplomacy

334
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
And he argues

335
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
If Sofrito could collect

336
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Could get Irani and property

337
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,743
It could be a disaster for the United States

338
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
Because Iran could retaliate

339
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
And if that dominoes fell

340
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,655
If you try to satisfy these individual lawsuit

341
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
How to foreign government Frozen funds

342
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,847
It can encourage those governments to retaliate against the United States with reciprocal Act

343
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,967
We have over 10 trillion dollars and US diplomatic property abroad

344
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,319
And if we start attaching their property for individual claims then

345
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
They can do the same

346
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Eman actually

347
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,415
Pales in comparison to the

348
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Second reason

349
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
Stuart says

350
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,511
Those frozen assets are leveraged

351
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
The US uses them as bargaining chip

352
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,143
The Americans held in Iran in 79

353
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,679
Big part of how we got them home

354
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
We unfroze Irani and acid

355
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,311
When we wanted to get pows home from Vietnam

356
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,895
When we wanted to know what happened the guys are gone missing in action

357
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
We used

358
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
Frozen Vietnamese assets as Leverage

359
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,527
The Clinton Administration was arguing

360
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
You stack up the interest

361
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
So the United

362
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
States versus the interest

363
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
The single family

364
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
There's a clear winner

365
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,791
But Steve Carlos the reparations lawyer wasn't going to let this go

366
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,863
He'd won a quarter billion dollar judgment

367
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,935
His client was the man who sued Iran and

368
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
1

369
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
It became a public fight

370
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
And paralysis

371
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,079
Complete strangers started trying to help them out

372
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,895
The more public the fight became the more people

373
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:51,295
I try to tell us about what they think are rainy and Assets in the United States that we haven't found some

374
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:57,695
California you guys don't know about

375
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Oh yeah

376
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Absolutely

377
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
Doesn't matter

378
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:05,119
As far as the White House is concerned diplomatic property is diplomatic proper

379
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,447
And then one day in the year 2000

380
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
There's a big

381
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,311
What are the calls at the office that we get is from

382
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,639
A gentleman who purports to be a retired

383
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Military

384
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,991
US military military officer give you a name

385
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
No-name no-name

386
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
This guy says

387
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
The US used to sell weapons to Iran

388
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
New secret there

389
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
That stopped after the Hosta

390
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,535
Did Crisis but Iran had already made a down payment

391
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
And he says

392
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
There's 420 million dollars of a ranian money sitting at the Pentagon in a weapons account that

393
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Was never used

394
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
You should go sees that

395
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,359
Perlis calls around with friends on Capitol Hill.

396
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,431
It's true there was a little bit of hide the Pu that got the

397
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
That got played

398
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
I don't know that

399
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:58,111
High tide page disappeared

400
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Here's what happened next

401
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,207
Pressure from the public was Emmett

402
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,511
People felt bad for Steve Flatow

403
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
So the Clinton White House back down

404
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,375
The White House and Congress negotiated

405
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
How to create a new statute called

406
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,239
Victims of trafficking and violence prevention Act

407
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
F2000

408
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
They offered Steve

409
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
25 million dollars

410
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Not a quarter billion

411
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,479
But a weave of other families had now also sued Aron for Acts

412
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,783
They were owed some of that money to

413
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
It was a compromise

414
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Steve says

415
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,903
He asked is it coming from the Iranians

416
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
And they said yes

417
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
He took it

418
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
I know I was not

419
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Truly happy

420
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,815
I know the federal government was actually happy

421
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,631
And taking that into account

422
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,215
The money that we accepted roughly 10% of our judgment

423
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
We going to have to do

424
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
You decided enough was enough

425
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
I decided enough was enough

426
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,919
Remember he didn't think he was going to get a nickel

427
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,711
Can use some of the money to

428
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
How to start a scholarship fund annalise's name

The man who sued Iran and won

431
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,695
Of course there's another man who sued Iran and one

432
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
Superlux the international reparations lawyer

433
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,071
He's been on a tear since the mid-90s

434
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,143
These on the strength of the precedents set by Steve flato

435
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,239
Eisenfeld versus Iran to other American Kids

436
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Another bus

Genco versus Iran

00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,407
A priest tortured for 18 months

440
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,455
Within 300 million in Damages

441
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,247
Peterson vs Iran

442

443
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Beecham vs Libya

444
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
It goes on

445
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:40,767
Sleep paralysis he's won 16 billion dollars in judgements against foreign countries

446
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,095
About 2 million of that so far has been paid out

447
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,471
He has won in court three and a half billion in judgements against Iran

448
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,311
Denise's remember what the point of all this was

449
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,383
3 1/2 billion dollars has gotten

450
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,455
Iran's attention how do you know that

451
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
Filed a complaint

452
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,599
In the international court of justice against the United States

453
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,647
All this worked at Perlis has been doing

454
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,303
That's a violation of international law we want our money back when making those people mad and that deterrence

455
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,351
I'm not saying that they will stop killing America

456
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
But they will think

457
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,935
Twice every time they playing out of

458
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
Basketball

459
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
And maybe just maybe

460
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
Some kid

461
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Is going to

462
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,431
Survive somewhere in the world because the Iranians have said we're going to get chased

463
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
Forever

464
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
If we

465
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,783
Kill us National on one of these

466
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,391
Cuz you'll be doing the chasing somebody else will be doing the chasing

467
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,695
Perlis has another big case underway

468
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
Stop loss vs Syria

469
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
Steven sotloff was an American journalist

470
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,375
He was beheaded by ISIS in the fall of 2014

471
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,215
And Congress recently voted to pave the way for another lawsuit

472
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
And it's a big one

473
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:59,615
Families of people who died in the September 11th attacks got the go-ahead to sue Saudi Arabia

474
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
A country

475
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,455
And not a state sponsor of Terror either

476
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,015
Saudi Arabia is a US Ally

477
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,111
With hundreds of billions of dollars in assets tied up here

478
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,463
And we have hundreds of billions of dollars of assets tied up in Saudi Arabia

479
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,559
Deflator wasn't paying a whole lot of attention to any of this

480
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,143
In the fifteen years since his settlement he's been focusing on

481
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
His kids the 16 grandkids

482
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,007
Disney World Bar Mitzvah bat mitzvah

483
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,103
And then in the summer of 2015 just like you and me

484
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,639
Steve Flatow her this

485
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
What's on the news

486
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
Today

487
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,735
After two years of negotiations

488
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,527
United States

489
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
Together we International partners

490
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,415
Have the chiefs something the Decades of animosity has not

491
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
A comprehensive long-term deal

492
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
With Iran

493
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
I will prevent it

494
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,071
From obtaining a nuclear weapon

495
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,631
An unprecedented deal with Iran

496
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,215
In spite of years of tension between the US and Iran

497
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,007
Diplomacy had one the day

498
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,335
A year ago Iran implemented the nuclear deal

499
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
And a day later

500
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:08,735
A Swiss Air Force plane takes off from the airport in Tehran carrying three Americans

501
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
If it held in Iranian prison

502
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,063
They were now heading home

503
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,903
That seemed a on a Tarmac at the airport in Tiffin

504
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,464
Iranian guards unload pallets and

505
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
Pallets of cash

506
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
From an airplane

507
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,328
It was and the US has admitted the

508
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
It was the money

509
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
400 some odd million

510
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,448
That had been sitting in the Iranian weapons

511
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,264
The same account Steve Flatow was told

512
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
His money came

513
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
And he realized something

514
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
Who's money did you get

515
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,456
The end of the day American taxpayer money

516
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
He thought he got interested

517
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:44,064
He thought he got in Iran's money

518
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
He had

519
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
15 years later

520
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,440
You wake up you see the money going back to Iran

521
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,560
You feel like a star you feel like a beggar that you've taken money out of the American taxes

522
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,376
And you want the government

523
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
Twitter on the right thing

524
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
You wanted chords

525
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
The money is there

526
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
Do you ever want to just

527
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Scream like

528
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,616
I was frustrated when I learned that the money had been released

529
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
To Iran

530
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
Your citizens

531
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
Have our judgements against

532
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
Issued by United States courts

533
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,624
It was it was low it was it was

534
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,672
Always with the word despicable

535
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,232
Because we didn't want American taxpayer money

536
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
What did Iranian money

537
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,120
Okay now here is an area of disagreement

538
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,960
Stuart eizenstat the former deputy treasury secretary

539
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
He says

540
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
No no

541
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,312
Congress spelled it out back in mm

542
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,640
Will pay but we are not using Iranian money

543
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,432
We are not losing our lives

544
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,016
This was not done by subterfuge was done by

545
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,320
A congressional action

546
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,416
Event is is Steve Flatow misremembering is he lying

547
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,232
You know when you're in intense negotiations

548
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,584
Things can sometimes be remembered in different ways

549
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:04,704
I don't know that we'll ever get an agreement on exactly what happens there

550
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,984
And in the years since

551
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,848
Some of these claims have ended up with victims getting actual Iranian money

552
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,944
Just about everyone I spoke to for this story could agree on one thing

553
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,808
In the coming years more Americans will likely die in Terror attacks

554
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,600
More lawsuits will be filed

555
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
And there will be more fight

556
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,160
It's over who gets paid

557
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
How

558
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,232
And whether or not they agree with Steve

559
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:31,584
Play-Doh diplomats and lawyers will tell you this is how the world is now

560
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
In part because of what he did

561
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,448
And here is what Steve will tell you

562
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,544
His daughter Eliza wasn't supposed to be on that bus that

563
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
Date sheet missed an earlier bus

564
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,896
And he still sometimes talks to her about

565
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,712
I hear her voice in the back of my head

566
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,296
She said to me Daddy why did this happen to me

567
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,392
I wish start out the same way I tell her that

568
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,696
Things happen that we don't understand

569
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,048
He tries to make sense of it for

570
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
That's what parents do

571
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,656
And he tries to cheer her up that's also what parents

572
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,472
He says you were in a place that you loved

573
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
You were where you were meant to

574
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
And he says

575
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,312
He believes that

576
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,152
And he says openly that he is at war with Iran

577
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Even today

578
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
He has no remorse about this

579
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,552
He says a bully hurt my kid and I went after the bully

580
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
That's something that parents do to

581
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:45,056
