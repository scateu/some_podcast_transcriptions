00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,816
This is planet money from NPR

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:07,424
What were you doing in Alaska I was on my boat

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,520
With my wife and another couple in the misty fjords

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,312
Oh and what kind of boat was this

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,360
I have a big boat

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,640
Is it like a yacht

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,688
I think you would call it a yacht

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,992
Nick hanauer is rich

9
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,784
Do you have a helipad on your

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,064
No no

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
No

12
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,880
Nick may have a modest yacht

13
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,928
But you can probably afford one with a helipad

14
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,976
He comes from a rich family

15
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
A family

16
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,280
Pillow Tycoon

17
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,352
We turned a very small pillow company into

18
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,912
One of the nation's largest pillow companies

19
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
Overtime it's cold

20
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,240
Pacific Coast Feather co

21
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,776
The family sold it at

22
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,056
Horseback

23
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,592
Well you still work there

24
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,664
Nick started helping them sell their pillows on the internet

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,712
And it was absolutely clear

26
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,272
In 1992 to me

27
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:58,112
That physical retail was essentially going to be dead

28
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
And

29
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,928
As luck would have it

30
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,512
I had a friend who shared that view is name is Jeff Bezos her

31
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,328
How did you meet Jeff Bezos just out of curiosity

32
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,888
He was dating one of my closest and oldest

33
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Friends

34
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,936
And

35
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,592
I was lucky enough to be the first investor in amazon.com and that led to other things and before you know it

36
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,640
I was a full-time technology

37
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
Venture capitalist

38
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
You started a company called a quantity

39
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,528
Which eventually sold to Microsoft for 6

40
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,320
6.4 billion dollars

41
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,392
He then invested in a bank with some friends and you get the

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
Bees the capitalist

43
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
Bernardo like Scrooge McDuck

44
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,840
Gordon Gekko I'm an oilman style capitalist he's also a philanthropist and

45
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
Got involved in politics

46
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,448
And you know my theory of change in the early days was that

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,752
All of the big

48
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,568
Challenges that America faced

49
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
With Rising inequality and poverty

50
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
Could be solved

51
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
If you just

52
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
Had a successful enough education to

53
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,064
System run 2070 says

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
TBN to realize

55
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,392
That the problem was bigger than just schools

56
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:09,536
The education system is not failing people it's the it's the economic system that's failing people the wealthy

57
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,840
Specifically the top 1% or

58
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
The top .01%

59
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,216
We're getting richer way faster than everyone else

60
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
And that scared him

61
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,056
If this trend continues

62
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,872
People are going to revolt

63
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
History shows

64
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
That level of inequality results in either a police state or a revolution

65
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Or both

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
He saw a future at work

67
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
A tiny few had everything

68
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,464
A kind of feudal world

69
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,488
That had to end

70
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
In violent revolution

71
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,096
Soap to be clear this wasn't just about do good

72
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
You was worried about himself

73
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
And his friends

74
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
You know being

75
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
Punished somehow or maybe

76
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,984
Guillotine Anderson

77
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,592

Andy Baker new causes

79
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
It's like a higher minimum wage

80
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
You got so worried

81
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Human gamete

82
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,576
Soap in 2012

83
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
I gave a TED Talk

84
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,440
On economic inequality

85
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,256
That got me thrown out of Ted

86
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,376
Like it was so controversial that we that they asked me not to come back

87
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,936
Yeah so the video of his lecture got taken down

88
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:23,520
But since then he's kind of become known for talking about in equality

89
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,824
Especially this one line he has

90
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,384
So what do I see in our future today

91
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
You asked

92
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
IC pitchfork

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
As in

94
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
Angry mobs

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,808

Have gotten so big that even yacht cruising zillionaires are getting

100
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Turning on their own time

101
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
And demanding change

102
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
It's high class war

103
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848

A new idea to redistribute wealth in America

The angry villagers are coming

110
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624

I hope and expect this to be the only time that I will speak to you in this matter

121
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,999
I would not provide information Beyond

122
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
That which is already published

123
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
In any appearance

124
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Before Congress

125
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,655
Special counsel Robert Mueller isn't getting his wish

126
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
He sets

127
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,007
To testify about his investigation into Russian interference

128
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,079
And possible obstruction of justice by President Trump

129
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,223
Afterwards the NPR politics podcast is going to be there to break down everything you need to know about what he says

130
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,367
The last time inequality in the United States was as bad as it is today

131
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
It was during the Roaring Twenties

132
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
We're talkin the great gaps

133
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,511
Flappers and fedoras prohibition

134
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
And then came the Great

135
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
It obliterated Fortune

136
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,447
Led to major changes and how we regulate capitalism

137
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,751
Elizabeth Warren running for president

138
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
Crusader against big money and wealth inequality

139
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,639
Recently proposed one solution to this Century Wild

140
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,687
Here she is on the campaign Trail

141
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
We can pay for it

142
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
I got away

143
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,319
Ultra millionaires tax

144
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,951
And the ultra millionaire tax is a pretty new idea for the United States

145
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
It is actually

146
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
That's because

147
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
It's a well pack

148
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
Not an income tax

149
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,935
Traditionally if you wanted to tax the wealthy in America you for the most part you taxed income

150
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
It's been that way for like a hundred

151
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
An income tax is Progressive

152
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
Meaning the more you make the more you pay

153
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,943
The old political debates focused on how much more the rich should pay

154
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
But when it comes to inequality

155
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,527
It's really wealth

156
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
More than income that matters

157
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
These two things often get conflated

158
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,647
But they're actually different

159
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
Income is what you make every year

160
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
It's like a running faucet

161
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,279
Wealth is what you own

162
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:30,399
The money in your bank your house your car your shares of Microsoft if you have stock

163
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
It's like a reservoir

164
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
So Jeff Bezos

165
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,567
Give a formal salary of less than $100,000

166
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,871
Not crazy high about the same as a

167
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
Typical School prints

168
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:46,271
What is worth at least before his divorce about 120 billion dollars

169
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:51,903
The thing that makes him rich is not his income it's really mostly his stocking Amazon

170
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
And unless he sells it

171
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
He's not

172
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Text on it

173
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
It just grows and grows

174
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
Nick hanauer think this is

175
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Is crazy

176
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
The reason that

177
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,167
Wealth is concentrating so much is that

178
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
I can grow my assets

179
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
For 40 years

180
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
Contacts

181
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
And if you don't have wealth

182
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,639
You obviously don't have anything just sitting there

183
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Growing and growing

184
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,991
What Warren is saying is she wants the federal government to

185
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
The top the reservoir of wealth

186
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
She wants a tax wealth

187
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,111
2% over 50 million dollars

188
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,415
And 3% over a billion

189
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,767
That means for every dollar you have over 50 million you're paying $0.02 a year

190
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,327
And $0.03 on every dollar over a billion

191
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
That doesn't really sound like a lot

192
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,191
But maybe you're not thinking like a billionaire

193
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
Because really rich people

194
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
Think a lot

195
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
About growth

196
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
Their different estimates but it's

197
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:47,967
Kind of safe to say that wealth grows on average about six or seven or eight percent over the long run

198
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
Every year

199
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,111
And then it's growth on the growth growing 7% over and over again like a snowball

200
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Compound growth

201
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,951
With this plan if the return stay on track

202
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,743
The rich will still get richer

203
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
But like half as fast

204
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
Sao innocence

205
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
3% is

206
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Kind of high

207
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
Now we haven't really taxed

208
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
12

209
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,799
I mean we trying to do with the property tax but that's state and local not federal

210
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
And usually only applies to

211
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
The real estate

212
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,431
It's basically a wealth tax that taxes only one form of well

213
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,039
And there is the estate tax which is basically a one-time wealth tax

214
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,111
But the rich person your texting has to die for

215
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
What Warren is proposing

216
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,999
Is the federal government count up the value of all the rich people stuff

217
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
And tax it every single year

218
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
We're talkin diamond ring

219
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
Jet skis

220
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
Normal skis

221
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Fancy tchotchke

222
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
Maserati

223
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Giacometti

224
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
What is that

225
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
The statues for rich people

226
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,639
Google expects a lot of rich people

227
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
They love the idea of a wealth tax

228
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,087
Difference is Frappuccino magnate and former presidential candidate Howard Schultz on NPR

229
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
When I see Elizabeth Warren

230
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
I come out with

231
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
You know a ridiculous

232
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
Plan of

233
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
Taxing wealthy people

234
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
So the founder of

235
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,143
Starbucks hates it you can't just

236
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,727
Attack these things in a punitive Way by punishing

237
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
So do a bunch of other rich

238
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,567
Be both but not all of them

239
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,383
Nick hanauer the early Amazon investor

240
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
He isn't the only one percenter jumping yacht

241
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
I got born really lucky

242
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,783
This is Liesel pritzker Simmons

243
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
She's a former child actress

244
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,855
You might have seen her in

245
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,415
Little princess or Air Force One

246
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,255
She's honestly great in the movies but that's not how she made her money

247
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:42,655
My family I had a number of different businesses but the ones that they are

248
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
Best known for is Hyatt Hotels

249
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
Liesel and her husband Ian

250
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,079
Also Rich say they've been thinking about the wealth tax for a while

251
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
But it wasn't until Warren's plan

252
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
Basalt real number

253
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
And I thought

254
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
Yeah

255
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
This could be a good thing

256
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,879
This is a relatively moderate tax on a fair amount of wealth

257
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
That could go to public use

258
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,023
You know better than it's sitting you know in our in our art collection

259
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
They thought it was time to send a message

260
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,143
From Rich America to the rest of America

261
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,215
Guys it's cool we're down with the Weld Pak

262
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Calling the rich friend

263
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Among them

264
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,151
George Soros billionaire investor Chris Hughes one of the founders of

265
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Facebook

266
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
Abigail Disney

267
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Youku

268
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Probably guess

269
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
I swear that money

270
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,039
And Nick hanauer

271
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:37,439
Indians that got eighteen other zillionaires to sign this letter and actually we have the letter here

272
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,463
Publish on medium

273
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
A Blog

274
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
But we we printed it out

275
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
And it's called

276
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,911
An open letter to the 2020 presidential candidates

277
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
It's time to tax us more

278
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,495
What kind of captures it but there's two

279
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
Other things they got in here

280
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
South America

281
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
Flag looking

282
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,431
Sandhill

283
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,527
The basically lay out everything they say a wealth tax could help pay

284
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
They say can help address the climate crisis

285
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
America's aging infrastructure childcare cost

286
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
Public health challenges like

287
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
The opioid epidemic

288
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
They say it's fair patriotic

289
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,095
The basic gist of this letter is this

290
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,239
Elizabeth Warren specific proposal says it's going to raise like 2.75 trillion dollars over 10 years

291
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
Chinese billionaires are saying

292
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,871
That's a lot of money that we can use to fix America's problem

293
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
And taxing wealth in this way is in

294
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Increasingly popular

295
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,295
There a few poles that show a clear majority of Americans

296
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
Support it like three-quarters of them

297
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
Even a majority of millionaires say they support

298
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
This policy

299
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
But

300
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
There is a caveat

301
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Well taxes

302
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
Have been tried before in other

303
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
And their track record

304
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
Everton General

305
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
It hasn't been great

306
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
After the break

307
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
When will taxes

308
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
Go wrong

309
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,175

322
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,759
It may be new for the US Federal

323
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,087
But actually wealth taxes they've been tried

324
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,183
They actually used to be quite popular in European countries

325
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,023
This is Sarah. She's an economist at the organization of economic

326
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
Make a cooperation and development

327
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
Or oecd

328
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,935
She did a study about well taxes and how they worked out

329
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,287
She says in 1990 there were 12 countries in Europe that had a wealth tax

330
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
Today there are only three

331
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,639
And so the trend has really been

332
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,991
To repeal them Brisas will Texas field for a bunch of reasons

333
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,551
First they were tough on people who looked

334
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,879
Rich on paper but were in fact shorten the cash needed to

335
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
To pay the tax

336
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,511
An example

337
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,607
I retired a long time ago was Lady braces

338
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:29,727
A house in jewelry and a bunch of other assets that make her look rich to the government

339
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:34,079
Really she only has a small pension and it's hard for her to come up with the money to

340
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
Pay the wealth tax

341
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,895
Another problem with the wealth tax

342
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,735
It was pretty expensive to track and value rich people stuff at

343
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
It's more complicated

344
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Then

345
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,927
An income tax for example or a property tax where you're just acting one type of acid

346
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
So here you're texting

347
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
All types

348
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
Sunsets are pretty easy to value

349
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
Like stocks

350
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Starbond

351
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
But others like paintings or your grandma's

352
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Engagement ring

353
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
Or your rare ocelot

354
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
Or your rare Savannah cat ostriches

355
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,871
Or your Alpaca Farm tigers

356
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
So the government is going to have to figure out a way to assess

357
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
The value of olives

358
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Which means bureaucracy

359
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,063
More accountants tax collectors

360
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
Calculator spreadsheet

361
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
The whole nine yards

362
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
30 shoe

363
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Exemption

364
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
Countries wouldn't tax all kinds of assets

365
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
So like in France Free People

366
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
They didn't text or worker antiques

367
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,471
Why waste money figuring out what these things are worth

368
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
Other countries Exempted business hours

369
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Things like factories machine

370
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:41,407
What are the things that like creature jobs and help the economy

371
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,223
And all those exemptions created a bunch of

372
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,807
The problems there is less money coming in because all those assets would be

373
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Being taxed

374
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,439
The people with the best accountants and lawyers game the system which made it unfair

375
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,327
Plus it created incentives for people to put their money in quirky weird places like artwork or antiques

376
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,655
Which is great for artists and antique dealers but

377
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
Not for the economy as a whole

378
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:09,055
And of course which people tried to protect their money by getting it out of the country

379
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
There is

380
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
A term for this

381
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Capital flight

382
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,687
Capital flight

383
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,783
Like rich people who couldn't figure out another way to evade taxes would sometimes just

384
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
Pick up and move

385
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,367
Like for example a ton of millionaires left

386
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,183
France and moved right across the border to Belgium

387
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
And

388
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Hoof

389
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
No more wealth

390
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,583
Or they find some tax shelter like a Monica or the Cayman Islands are

391
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,143
Also not good for the economy

392
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
Sonia

393
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,775
The policy didn't even breathe much money like you didn't do what I was supposed to do

394
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
So back to work

395
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,943
Her chip are used they specifically designed their proposal with Europe's failures in mine

396
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,807
What is proposal really only taxes the very very rich

397
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,623
Those with over 50 million dollars in wealth

398
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,951
That's only about 75000 families in the United

399
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
It states

400
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,023
In Europe the threshold was much lower

401
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,583
In some cases around a million dollars or even less

402
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
Not the ultra-rich

403
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,655
But the sort of

404
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,263
So under warranty plan at old lady with the fancy house in the nice jewels

405
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
She's going to be just fine

406
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,591
Not rich enough to get tan

407
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
Plus the proposal says very clearly

408
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
No exemption

409
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
None

410
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
Zero zilch

411
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Nada

412
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
But what about my sports car

413
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,135
Now yeah that's going to be that's going to be taxed

414
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
How about my pet tiger

415
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
Tigers will definitely beat

416
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
My musket collect

417
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
How rich are you alive

418
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
Faberge egg

419
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
None of that

420
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
But

421
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,239
No exemptions means the IRS is going to have to get bigger and way better at tracking rich people stuff every year

422
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,311
They're going to have to Value those Faberge eggs

423
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Birkin bags

424
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
Pet tigers

425
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,223
You brought the value a tiger what the IRS is going to have to have a tiger done

426
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,551
Plastic Alicia how much are those anyway I don't know

427
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,855
Too many people this sounds like a lot but

428
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Nick hanauer

429
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,487
He doesn't think it's a big deal at all you hire 300 IRS agent

430
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
They cost

431
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
$200,000 a piece

432
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
Just focus on nothing but this problem

433
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Costs

434
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
60 million dollars

435
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Against

436
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Literally

437
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,103
Hundreds of billions of dollars in potential income I mean it's

438
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
Cheap to do

439
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Lisa's

440
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943
This valuation problem you know

441
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
Figuring out how much your Tigers worth

442
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,783
This can be solved

443
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,599
There's a very very very simple way to handle

444
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Which is

445
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,951
You get to write down all of your assets and pick a number

446
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,327
And then the government has the right to buy any of those assets at the price that you pick

447
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,911
This self evaluation method by the way it is kind of brilliant

448
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,263
I mean think about it if you try to save money by undervaluing your stuff

449
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
You're going to lose it

450
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,127
And I mean this is obviously going to be a tough sell in the United

451
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,943
Let's see the government is able to do something

452
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
That still leaves the issue of capital flight

453
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
But

454
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,135
US citizens can't just move to another country to avoid taxes

455
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,975
The US taxes its citizens wherever they are in the world

456
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,839
The tax evaders would have to renounce their citizenship to legally avoid the well tab

457
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,167
And if you're a rich person who renounces your citizenship

458
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,727
Weren't supposed the federal government confiscate

459
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,543
40% of your wealth over a billion dollars

460
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,151
But you're you're a suspiciously good whistler

461
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Thanks

462
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
But

463
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
There's another big problem

464
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
The US

465
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Institution

466
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
It makes it hard for the federal government

467
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
It's a directly taxed

468
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:39,231
100 years ago it took a constitutional amendment to Institute the income tax

469
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,327
There's some legal Scholars who argued we need another amendment for wealth

470
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,631
And that would be a huge hurdle to do

471
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,191
But if you support taxing the wealthy more

472
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,263
In this constitutional issue ends up being a problem

473
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,055
There might actually be good news

474
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,431
0 priests that he concludes you can deal with wealth inequality without a wealthy

475
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,503
Our study finds that in general a combination

476
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:07,903
I've broad-based taxes on personal capital income tax on dividends capital gains interest

477
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,975
As well as well design inheritance taxes

478
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:16,607
Might be a more effective way of addressing Welton equality without some of the negative size of what

479
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:23,263
In effect in many countries in Europe where wealth inequality is not quite as bad as it is in the United States

480
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
This strategy seems to be working

481
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,383
But it wouldn't touch many of today's huge fortunes

482
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
For decades

483
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,455
Lots of billionaires are pretty young

484
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,295
Mark Zuckerberg for example he was only born in 1984

485
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,623
Inheritance or estate tax might not affect his wealth for like

486
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:44,255
50 or 60 or 70 years depending on whatever bionic implants he might be able to get

487
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,095
I mean he could live forever literally forever if we have the technology in the next

488
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,423
50 years to like upload his Consciousness into the cloud

489
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,495
Floating in our phones all the time

490
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,335
And look if you really want to destroy wealth inequality

491
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
Actually roll it back

492
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,199
I will tax of 3% isn't really going to cut it

493
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,551
Again what goes at like 6 or 7 or 8% per year on average

494
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,855
Don't Litter that Nick and Liesl signed

495
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,927
Because specifically for a quote moderate wealth

496
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
And so we were curious

497
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,023
When does it stop being moderate

498
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,375
How much are these doing is really willing to pay to stop the pitchforks

499
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
So we asked

500
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
Nick hanauer

501
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,263
That y'all don't venture capitalist too riled up so many of his fellow 1-percenter

502
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
When does the wealth tax

503
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
Stop being moderate

504
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
And when would you stop supporting it

505
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
That's a super good question

506
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
And it's something I haven't thought

507
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,039
Carefully about so

508
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
Immoderate

509
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
Tomillo moderate wealth tax

510
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
Simply

511
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
Slows the growth

512
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Of

513
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
Large pools of assets

514
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,167
And so a 2% tax on that or 3% tax on that

515
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:01,567
Slows the growth rate from 8% to 5% which means you're still getting a ton richer than everyone else

516
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,847
In the country

517
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,175
If you take the growth rate

518
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
2-0

519
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
That's a no longer moderate

520
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,807
And

521
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,879
I guess that begins to test

522
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
Even my

523
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,184
Comfort

524
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
With

525
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
With a wealth tax

526
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
So

527
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,584
Perhaps unsurprisingly

528
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
Hanauer has limits

529
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
Tax enough to slow the growth

530
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
Not so much you stop

531
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:33,824
But he's still out there agitating amongst his fellow zillionaires

532
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,944
After we got off the phone with him he said he was headed to Edinboro to give a speech about wealth inequality

533
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
Are they still pushing for a wealth tax

534
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Immoderate

535
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,296
Welltok

536
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,440
