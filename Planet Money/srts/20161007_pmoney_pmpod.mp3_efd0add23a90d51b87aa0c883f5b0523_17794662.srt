In the country

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,056
Wells Fargo got into trouble

8
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,824
Furious

9
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,872
Trouble a federal investigation show

10
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,432
That Wells Fargo was secretly opening

11
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,200
Bank accounts

12
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,480
People's names without

13
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
Their permission

14
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,784
Checking account

Credit cards loan

16
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,856
Right and not just a couple

17
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
We're talkin about up to

18
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,928
2 million of these

19
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,232
This is come out now and this is blown up into

20
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
Giants

21
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
Banking scam

22
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,096
Maybe saw this on the news Wells Fargo payday

23
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,656
Huge fine fired a bunch of low-level employees

24
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
But that wasn't enough

25
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
US Senate demanded

26
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,032
The bank CEO John Stumpf

27
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,312
Appear on Capitol Hill

28
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
Senator Elizabeth Warren

29
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,640
Had a few thoughts

30
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,688
She haven't resigned

31
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,016
You haven't returned to single nickel if your personal earning

32
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,344
Instead evidently your definition of accountable

33
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
Is to push the blame to your low-level employees who don't have the money for a fancy PR firm to defend

34
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
Michelle

35
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,328
It's gutless leadership

36
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,936
Stop sat quietly through this and when it was his turn to speak essentially what he said

37
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
With luck

38
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,752
There was some bad apples okay

39
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,824
But we fired the bad apples everything's cool now

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
And

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
Upper manager

42
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Not guilty

43
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,432
We never directed

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,296
Nor wanted our team member to provide products and services to customers

45
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
That they did not want

46
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,392
The hearing was all over the news

47
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:36,000
And in San Francisco one of those low-level employees without a PR firm

48
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,048
Was watching her former boss

49
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,376
Ashley work for Wells Fargo for 5 years

50
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
And she

51
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
Could not believe

52
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
Use me up

53
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
B*******

54
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
Like this was such a sissy

55
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
Stomach

56
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,408
Thing that was taught its ass it's the sales culture

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
So that's just

58
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
SPS

59
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
And Ashley said you know what

60
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
I'm going to show the world

61
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
How to scam work

62
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:07,488
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Robert Smith I'm Chris Arnold and Robert today we are going inside

63
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
A Wells Fargo Bank

64
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,328
And not just any Wells Fargo

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
This is the branch

66
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,216
On the first floor of the Wells Fargo headquarters building in San Francisco

67
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,544
This is a place where a bunch of stressed-out young people were pushed

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
And pushed

69
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
And pushed

70
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
Until they get some Very Bad Things

71
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,944
And while all that was going on the CEO John Stumpf

72
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224

92
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:12,768
I went to the Wells Fargo headquarters building Robert and it's a pretty plain Stone and glass skyscraper building right now

93
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,048
Downtown San Francisco

94
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
Pretty unremarkable though it's surrounded by

95
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
Taller building

96
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,656
For Ashley though

97
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,472
She came with me and said she remembers everything about

98
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
She was 23 patent finish college

99
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Call Dad personal banker

100
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,200
So she dressed like she thought of personal Bankers address

101
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,760
Stiletto heels about a

102
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,088
Pounded hairspray and bobby pins in my hair

103
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
I felt

104
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
Proud and

105
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
Fortunate to be able to work for such a big company and really the sky was the ceiling

106
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
This was 2007

107
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,912
The beginning of the financial crisis and other bags were starting to panic

108
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
But not Wells Fargo

109
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
They were still growing they were still expanding

110
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
Wells Fargo position itself as the

111
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Foxybae

112
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104
You know the everyday friendly

113
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
Their plan was to get to the crisis by adding more customers

114
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
I taking it

115
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,224
More money into account

116
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
I could get more

117
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
How to get more money

118
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
They needed sale

119
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
That would be Ashley's jobs

120
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,136
Young

121
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
Long hair sparkly eyes

122
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
It would sit in the back lobby waiting for someone to come

123
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
Customer walks in and we'd have to go through the whole notion of standing up high mr. so-and-so what can I help you with

124
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
I'm looking to open a checking account

125
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Great

126
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
Tell me about yourself

127
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
Part of the technique was to sell the grand history of Wells Fargo unit Wells Fargo wagons coming down the street

128
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
Stagecoach B 1800

129
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
In fact there is a giant antique Stagecoach

130
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Parked right there in the lobby

131
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Nextdoor Ashley

132
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,159
So Ashley worked with a lot of other young p

133
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,487
People send them had suits on for the first time they were very excited to

134
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
To be there

135
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,583
And we talked with a bunch of them one of them was Eric

136
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
And like Ashley he only wants to

137
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Jesus first name

138
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:58,495
What he says they would do it they would leverage this wholesome reputation

139
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
To get people to sign up for

140
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,615
Does he know the reputation that we know that you were going into a safe place

141
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
Right this is where I go to

142
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
Park my money right this is where I go to

143
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:11,551
You know I'm get tools and instruments that will help me in my family advance

144
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
And succeed in life

145
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,695
The last thing that would be in the back your mind would be there at 8

146
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Now every Bank

147
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Tries to upsell

148
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
You've been there right

149
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
You have a checking account to say hey why not get a credit card

150
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,567
What is called cross-selling in NM to some degree make sense but Eric and Ashley say Wells Fargo took it to a whole nother level

151
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,151
And then we're just pushing another bank account but let's say okay

152
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
You should probably have a credit card and

153
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
Multiple savings accounts

154
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:45,087
Perhaps in and if you got kids going to college baby baby checking accounts and credit cards

155
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
Yeah how about a new line of credit

156
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,183
And a business line of credit

157
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
While we're at it

158
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,023
This was a corporate priority the more customers

159
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
The more accounts

160
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
The healthier the bank

161
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,119
The CEO John Stumpf

162
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
He worked upstairs

163
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
American Ashley in the headquarter

164
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
Get a slogan

165
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727

166
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495

167
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775

King Savings credit cards another prop

171
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,039
And Ashley was expected to open a new account 8 new product every single day so this wasn't just some aspirin

172
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,879
There was a goal and her managers would push her all day long

173
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:23,231
It was how are you going to meet your goal if your numbers were

174
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,839

187
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:55,487
Actually all the bankers we talked to said that Wells Fargo would burn through a lot of young

188
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Workers this

189
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Never get hired

190
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Sell Wells Fargo products to

191
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
But everybody that they knew when they could call on the phone

192
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,215
And then they get pushed out when they didn't have anybody else to sell to

193
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
Ashley told us a story about how deadly

194
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
Sirius the managers were about these

195
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Quotas

196
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,199
One day Ashley was working a few blocks away from headquarters that What's called the Crocker

197
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Temperature

198
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
And

199
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
A bank robber

200
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,903
A bank robber and police show up outside and Ashley is telling us all about this

201
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
And whatever conversations on the phone

202
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,511
Cops were swarming to shut everything down

203
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,839
No public couldn't come in do you know your employee

204
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,143
You know you're watching all this and the guy jump

205
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
The counter

206
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
Crazy big Fiasco

207
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
They have the guy detained he like crapped his pants

208
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,615
Stinky akkineni State the heart attack it was

209
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
Don't even look at it

210
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
Dial for dollars

211
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
And Ashley is sitting at her desk

212
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
And her manager

213
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Her district manager

214
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
Says do

215
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Not

216
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,391
Leave your desk keep selling

217
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Nope

218
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:02,815
You don't think you're walking out or going home early even though we're closed for the rest of the day style $4.

219
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Dollars

220
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:09,983
How am I supposed to be on the phone with a client hold a conversation try to sell my checking account

221
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,823
Breaking a million cops in our lobby being loud and noisy

222
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
I mean it's not like

223
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
And he said where you and your co-workers dislike are you

224
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Kidding me like

225
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
The guys like crap himself I mean it was like no

226
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
On the clock

227
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,839
You know course they're not going to be like okay everybody like let's have a discussion about what just happened

228
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
No no it was

229
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
What is a boiler room

230
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Dial

231
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
$4

232
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
Yeah it just never stopped

233
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Dial $4

234
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:50,175
And he was all of this pressure being put on Ashley and Eric

235
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
It was working

236
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
The bank was

237
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
Huge financial success

238
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,599
In 2009 you know some banks are still struggling from the financial

239
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
That's right

240
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,903
Wells Fargo announced

241
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Record earnings

242
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,975
These guys were selling a lot

243
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:08,607
A product and around that time a profile and Fortune magazine called Wells Fargo a rare upbeat Tale

244
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
I meant the banking

245
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Wreckage

246
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
The bank needed new money

247
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
Going so they added more

248
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
And Ashley says there were no excuses

249
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
Not a bank robbery

250
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
Not exhaustion when Ashley

251
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Didn't meet her number

252
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Two managers would show up at

253
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
They said come with us

254
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,855
So I walked with them followed the two of them

255
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:35,999
Through the large Bobby you know passed all my colleagues would not

256
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,839
You know it's like being called into the principal's office

257
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
Sit down at the large

258
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:46,495
Conference table no windows in this room they shut the door lock the door

259
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,799
Import neon formal warning and say

260
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,639
Here's your formal warning you have to sign this

261
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,991
You don't need your Solutions you will be fired and it's going to be on your

262
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
Permanent record

263
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,343
I mean it was real like you worse

264
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
Stopped in it was

265
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:07,743
The feeling that no other employer is going to watch you because we will

266
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
Ruined you

267
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,815
They were simply saying to Ashley

268
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,375
Play if you don't make it here at Wells Fargo

269
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
You're not going to get another job and pay

270
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
After one of these coaching

271
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
Sessions went back to her desk

272
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,335
Sat down but I got sick to my stomach

273
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,175
And I threw up under my desk like it really made me feel

274
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Physically sick

275
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
You know what

276
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
I heard similar stories

277
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,831
Four other employees the stress

278
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Crying

279
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Not just an Ashley

280
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,975
Bankruptcy that is the sales person being pushed all over the country all over downtown Tampa

281
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
And it's not like his employees were getting rich

282
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,119
Ashley said she made around $35,000 a year

283
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,935
It's striking that she and her colleagues were

284
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,007
Pretty young I mean he's reserved their first corporate job

285
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
When we talked to Eric he said

286
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
The Pressure lyrics

287
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Actually it was just

288
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,919
Triplet II Jesse was he was everyday man

289
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
I mean if it was literally every day

290
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
And it was I

291
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
A Grindhouse

292
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,343
The goals just seemed impossible

293
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,135
The pressure was overwhelming but

294
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,183
There actually was a way out

295
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Employees cheat

296
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
The cheetah

297
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,071
They figured out ways to make new accounts appear out of thin air

298
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
And always

299
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,959
Seems to happen in the Scandal and we saw this in the mortgage crisis to write

300
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
You give someone a number

301
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
You say meet it no matter what

302
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
And they start figuring out ways

303
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
To pick shortcut

304
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
Fudge that number

305
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,551
And at Wellsburg Woodforest this stuff you could argue was pretty minor so up customer would come in they have any best

306
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Sega CD

307
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
Certificate of deposit it was $10,000

308
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,767
So the bank employee could split that up into 10 different accounts with $1,000 in each

309
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
What account becomes 10

310
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
It's like magic

311
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
And then you meet your daily goal

312
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,679
It was another trick there you could just slip extra accounts

313
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
Into the paperwork

314
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
Say someone want a home equity loan

315
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
You can add a personal line of credit

316
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,103
Into the stack of papers they were signing and just take

317
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Got a new account

318
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Customer never even notice

319
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,063
Now the problem there was that was starting to get a little more serious because you give someone a personal line of credit for $25,000

320
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
That will affect your credit

321
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,927
Ashley remembers one day when a man comes into the bank

322
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,767
Use elderly he had Cain

323
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,071
He's on his own

324
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,143
The tolerance sent him over to me the first day I met on

325
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,031
Because he was overdraft and he couldn't understand why he was negative and he was saying

326
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,383
All I want is to buy a newspaper why can't I buy my newspaper

327
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
Ashley post office account on a computer

328
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
And she notices something really strange

329
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
This man was living off of Social Security

330
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
He got around $1,100

331
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
A month

332
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
And yet

333
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Ohia

334
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
Crude I think over

335
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,999
$200 in overdraft and when I looked at is a

336
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
The accounts he had six different accounts

337
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:56,447
He had no understanding of accounts he had he just said oldest nice lady

338
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,031
I explained to me that I needed this new account package

339
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
Like it wasn't an option for him

340
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
High salt

341
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
So terrible for this man

342
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,271
Actually waved all the fees that the system would let her way for this guy

343
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,855
But then she did something even more shoot she went into her own checking account

344
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
How to money out and put it into the old man's account

345
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Just getting back to zero

346
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,791
So you could like buy is newspaper in and not get any more overtime

347
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
Ashley said she tried

348
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
To report the employee

349
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
Wood sign this man up for so many accounts

350
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,215
But her managers

351
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Didn't do anything

352
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
Later she would start to call the company's ethics line

353
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Again

354
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
And again

355
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
But nothing

356
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
And you got to ask how far up

357
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,503
Did this guy did the executives know what their employees were doing to me please

358
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,391
I mean Wells Fargo with Bragg to top investors of the CEO would say an investor calls eight is great

359
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,695
I mean this is being heralded from the rooftop

360
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
And remember

361
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
Ashley and Eric are working in the lobby of the corporate headquarters actually says Wells Fargo bigwigs wood

362
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
Walked by her death

363
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,495
She would hold the door open sometimes and guess would come through

364
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
The CEO

365
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
John stop

366
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,127
Oh yeah I saw his car is always parked in the alley right behind my jaw

367
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,503
These people are fixtures and work directly upstairs and then

368
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
There was a

369
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,623
Because you can't just keep giving people accounts that they don't want

370
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
Forever Without

371
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,255
Is starting to come back on you to send degree right so customers were noticing the extra cat

372
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,327
A few lawsuits were filed because all these customers working

373
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Complaining

374
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,911
But for a longtime customers were told look at the simple mistake

375
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
Any accounts were closed

376
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
It seems like no one was seeing the big picture

377
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,823
This game started to unravel in 2013

378
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,663
LA Times Reporter published a story about some of the intense

379
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Sales pressure

380
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,735
People like Ashley were feeling at Wells Fargo

381
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
So after that

382
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Regulator Surgical

383
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Consumer Financial

384
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,695
Protection Bureau is investigating along with the LA City attorney's office

385
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Last month

386
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,279
The cfpb hit Wells Fargo with the biggest

387
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,351
Penalties ever issued against any financial institution in

388
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
History

389
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:07,519
It estimated that might have been more than 2 million unwanted accounts we found up 5000 Wells Fargo employees were

390
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
You're fired

391
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
This whole thing blew up giant mess Giants game

392
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,431
But we should say that the fines total about a hundred and eighty-five

393
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:18,015
Million-dollar pretty small in the big scheme of banking

394
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,343
There is still an investigation about who knew what

395
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
And when do they know it

396
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,743
We contacted Wells Fargo to ask about all this and we show them with Ashley and Eric and others it said

397
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
Add Wells Fargo spokesman Oscar suris

398
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
Redis repaired

399
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,959
Although the vast majority of our team members do the right thing everyday on behalf of our customers

400
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
These allegations and accusations are very serious

401
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:44,895
And if any of these things transpired it's distressing and it's not who Wells Fargo is

402
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,991
Are bored and announced last week that it will lead an internal investigation

403
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
Into retail banking sales practices

404
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
And related matters

405
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
Ashley and Eric both left Wells Fargo

406
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
Before all of this

407
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
Eric quit his job after the

408
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
The pressure just started to get

409
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
Too much RAM to deal with

410
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
He was getting stomach problem

411
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
Xyzzy set worth

412
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,167
Yeah it was a good just got to a point where you know

413
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,983
It was just like I can't I just can't handle this man

414
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
As far as Ashley

415
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
She started to refuse to meet

416
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,407
Her quota she was just saying like I can't ethically do this she was

417
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
Calling the Wells Fargo Ethics Line trying to explain his butt

418
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
Eventually Wells Fargo fire

419
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
Ashley tried to get another job in banking

420
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,951
But she found she never made it very far past the initial interview

421
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:34,559
She suspected that Wells Fargo had put some sort of black mark on her record

422
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Somewhere

423
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
And it turns out that is

424
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Exactly the

425
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,447
Wells Fargo wasn't joking around when they said they would make it

426
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,727
Hard for her to find working

427
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
Wells Fargo wrote her up

428
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,871
On what's called a u5 document it's like a report card for Banker

429
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Basically

430
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,967
We tracked it down and we asked Ashley to read what it says

431
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Failure

432
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
To perform job duties

433
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,807
Any Bank

434
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
Any Bank

435
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
But Ashley applies to

436
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Will see this line

437
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
Failed to do job.

438
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
The form does not mention

439
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Fado's job duties

440
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
Where the sales go

441
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
But everyone we spoke to

442
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,119
They were unrealistic and that are at the center

443
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
Of a series of ongoing investigation

444
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Is it the state

445
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
And federal level

446
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
It just has failed to do job duties

447
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,055
It was the first time Ashley had seen it in

448
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
It's like having a black

449
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,871
Cloud that

450
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,455
Carnival looming behind you and I'm always trying to get

451
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,759
In front of the cloud out of the

452
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,575
Cloud into the sunshine but it's always

453
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
There

454
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,719
But at least now with the investigation maybe people can start to see through that black cloud

455
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
And see what Wells Fargo did

456
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:47,263
We always love to hear what you think of the show you should email is Planet Money at npr.org or you can
