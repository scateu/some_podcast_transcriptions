00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:01,792
Here at Planet Money

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,072
NPR offices

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,864
We have this little Muse

4
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:09,216
With a bunch of memorabilia from different episodes across the years there's the planet

5
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:09,984
T-shirt

6
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,800
A Santa hat little vial of oil

7
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,080
Another little vial

8
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:14,848
Gold

9
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
And

10
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
This

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
It's a jar

12
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,224
Looks like it was once

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,504
A peanut butter jar

14
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,296
And on the side of it is this label

15
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,112
It says Planet Money investment fund

16
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,904
And there's a handful of building

17
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,928
5

18
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,464
A50

19
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,768
Every few years at Planet Money

20
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,304
We take this money

21
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
And we make

22
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
Investing

23
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
Some would say so much

24
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,656
Questionable in

25
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,728
What are my favorite experiments we did back in 20

26
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,264
We did a few shows on it

27
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,568
And the first one of those were going to be plated

28
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,592
Cured

29
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:51,200
Basically every penny I own

30
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:55,296
It's all a bet in One Direction's all bet that everything is going

31
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
Like I own a house

32
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
Right that is a bad thing

33
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
Real estate

34
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,744
And you're so crazy because you are a guy who is normally pretty cynical about

35
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,584
I look my entire retirement account right it's like stocks

36
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,656
Stocks are bet that a company is going to be worth

37
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:15,008
Bonded loan to some municipality that's going to build like a

38
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:21,408
Sewage treatment facility it's a bet that that's going to work out they're going to pay me back no one would call you little Mary sunshine and yet

39
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,712
You are doing what everyone else in America.

40
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
Switch is to

41
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,344
Bad things are just going to get better and historically like that is not the worst better than

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,416
No it's a totally fine but it just struck me as odd all the

43
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Because

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464
There is no other better

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
You can make right

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,536
You can bet in the opposite direction

47
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
You can make a bed

48
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
That will pay off

49
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
When things go badly

50
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
Hey perhaps you've heard us talk about this

51
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Before it is called

52
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
A short

53
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
A short sell it so if you short Apple stock you're basically betting that Apple stock is going to be worth less than a month

54
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
32 months or a year

55
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,968
And the goes down everyone else is crying the very very sad

56
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
You have to celebrate

57
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
Their loss is your gain

58
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
And it's not actually that

59
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Hard

60
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:06,720
Too Short something and you can do it online anywhere where you can buy stocks you can also short stocks and yet

61
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
The most part

62
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:08,768
Nobody

63
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
We decided we would we would short something we consulted a bunch of experts they told us not to do it

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,496
I said there are some very very good reasons people don't short

65
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
Run off the planet money I'm David kestenbaum

66
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
And I'm Robert Smith today on the show we ignore the advice of some very smart people and we short some

67
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,832
We're going to put our money down on a bat against something that everybody loves

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
If you haven't been reading Planet money's newsletter you're missing out on stories about

69
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
Hidden beaches and scooter Mania and plastic bag ban it's just the right amount of economics and

70
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,472

Planet Money newsletter

73
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,664
Longtime listeners will know that we have a little bit of money set aside for a moment

74
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,808
I guess I could call the Planet Money investment fund also known as the world's least successful hedge fund

75
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,392
Back in 2010 I think it was we all put two hundred bucks

76
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
Can each total of $1,000

77
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,256
First we bought a toxic asset one of those

78
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:16,096
Mortgage things that I was brought down the global economy proxy

79
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
We lost half our money on that

80
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,960
The Jake but I took what was left we bought gold we actually bought a gold

81
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Coin

82
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
We lost some more money that was like 3 years ago

83
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
I put whatever we had left

84
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
In a locked cabinet

85
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
And we basically forgot about

86
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Until last week

87
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Robert

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,528
Yes sir I see how much money we have left in the Planet Money investment fund

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Oh yeah totally

90
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,856
Where is it in the locker

91
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,184
I'm surprised it's under lock and key

92
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Thr

93
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
What is it like $6

94
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,152
I have a confession

95
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,992
A couple years ago I need to cash it didn't have time to go to an ATM

96
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
So I got the money out of the jar I did put a little note there but

97
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:14,464
Looking at it today like I don't know exactly what I meant by this note there two numbers there one is crossed out

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm pretty sure we have

99
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
$406

100
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Sixth Sense

101
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
What's left in the fun

102
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
Teacher are the worst

103
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Good Ship Lollipop

104
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
All right man

105
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,239
Play money jar is back in effect

106
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
A little

107
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
This is it

108
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
See if we can

109
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
If we make it all back

110
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
There's no way we're making it

111
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,343
It is theoretically possible

112
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,207
The reason why we wanted to pick short against these really we have done podcast on shorting before and

113
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,255
Economist are always talking about this

114
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,327
Important part of the financial markets that

115
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,631
Help stocks from becoming too hyped

116
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,911
Keep bubbles from forming

117
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,263
I really had no idea how it really worked I certainly didn't know like

118
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
What we should short or had a

119
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
We went to consult

120
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
An expert one of the ex

121
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
This guy's name is Andrew

122
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,711
Used to write a newsletter

123
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
The title was

124
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Stock lemon

125
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,271
Noah changed

126
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Well

127
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
Stock lemon

128
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
Was very tongue-in-cheek

129
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
I thought I just needed more of a

130
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
A highbrow name

131
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
The new name

132
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,023
Citron research

133
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,071
And it's been at this for over a day

134
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,655
He's the guy that went CNBC needs to get a short seller on

135
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
They often grab

136
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,031
And he's great on the air because he's betting against things that other people love

137
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:38,431
You know those little cameras that if you go skiing you see everyone has his little cameras on top of their helmet GoPro a short GoPro

138
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,831
Is short Tesla another company a lot of people love and Green Mountain Coffee K-Cups that you

139
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,855
You put in the ass

140
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
Yeah yeah exactly

141
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
So he asked his advice

142
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,231
Suppose someone with almost no investment

143
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
And

144
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
And very little money

145
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
Came up to you and said

146
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
I want to try too short

147
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
No

148
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
Don't do it

149
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Why

150
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,543
It's not it's a very skilled formers invest

151
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,615
It really is not for the average

152
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
Investor

153
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
It's dangerous

154
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,223
You can lose too much money doing it

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,271
The forces of Wall Street are against you

156
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
It's not worth it

157
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
Do something else

158
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,695
You know we went into this I sort of thought that shorting a stock was just the opposite

159
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Buying us

160
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,535
Instead of betting that a stock is going to go up you're just betting that it's

161
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:31,679
What is we dug into it I realized it is not it is a completely different animal in just about every way

162
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:38,079
Yeah there's all these hurdles you have to go through I think both mentally and financially before you can short a stock I mean

163
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
The first one is the most

164
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Basic thing

165
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
Which is okay

166
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,527
Most stocks seem to go up over time you have to find a company

167
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
It is

168
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,391
You have to find a company where you know something that no one else knows you have to find a company

169
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
You hope

170
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
Whoops lunging

171
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
You got to find something like this guy

172
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,351
My name is Sam and Randy on the chief messing up surf Kerrisdale capital

173
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,703
Sam is another famous short seller he is 33 years old

174
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:11,103
And 4033 year olds getting very large coin jar is hedge fund has over quarter billion.

175
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
Dollars under management

176
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,943
Is abscess where a few blocks away we went over to talk to him

177
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
Unfancy

178
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
Samsat down in this little conference

179
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,087
And he coached us on how to pick a stock to bedok

180
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
He told us this one

181
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Perfect little story

182
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
Best case scenario

183
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
About this one company that

184
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
Sound too short this is back in 2010

185
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,839
I'm in Santa's poking around looking at

186
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
Certain Chinese cup

187
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
Chinese Dumplings

188
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,727
Starting to get listed on us stock exchanges any found

189
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:42,847
This one company that I had a business model like Princeton Review they basically

190
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Coach Chinese students

191
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,943
On how to pass entrance exams for college

192
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Company was called China educational

193
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
It was Opry Mills classes in selling these

194
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
Sample test online

195
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
And

196
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Sam looked at the website looked okay to him

197
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
But he couldn't

198
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
Read Chinese

199
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,255
I got a guy who could read Chinese actually try it out

200
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
Any found something weird

201
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
And we came back with those

202
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
Cannot connect to purchase any product

203
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,447
Despite the fact that this business half of its sales

204
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
From selling testing on its website

205
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
It's test as website

206
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
Was completely non-functional

207
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,335
Wait they couldn't like

208
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,967
Order anything or put in their attic when you tried to go to the part of the website where you would put in your credit card

209
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
An error screen popped

210
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,527
Barry

211
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Very suspicious

212
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,623
But you know the company did say that it taught classes in

213
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Person soap

214
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,927
He decide to check on that

215
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
This is harder to check because the building where the classes

216
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Frittata in this Northern

217
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
Province of China near the border with Russia

218
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
But some found a guy to go check it out

219
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,703
Like he found a freelancer through one of these websites are

220
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
Say I'll do God jobs

221
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Some pay the guy $1,000 when she was

222
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Very excited

223
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
And ask him to go check out the building

224
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
And we have to take a camera

225
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,223
So I went there and saw there was a

226
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
Completely vacant building

227
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,367
What do you want to eat in the forest with 6 floors there no chairs or no chalkboards

228
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
It was just a completely vacant building

229
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
So think about this for a moment

230
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,255
There's a company

231
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,583
Did everyone loves that everyone thinks is doing is gangbusters business

232
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
And some knows something unique

233
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
He knows that this company

234
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
Isn't doing anything

235
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
Something that the fraud

236
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
A perfect stock to Short

237
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
Someone deceased

238
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
Like if you find something

239
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,943
You think it's like this you have to be really careful you have to do your research

240
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
Because

241
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,247
What's about to happen next

242
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
Can be a total roller coaster

243
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
Though the actual Act of shorting a stock

244
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,135
Turns out to be very soon

245
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
Just a matter of pressing

246
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
The red button instead of the green button on your account

247
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
Was it really just a button the red button you press

248
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,911
It is a red button yeah I think it was a short

249
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,727
Remember how it felt pressing my button

250
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,079
Slightly dangerous

251
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
Your normal investing you biased

252
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,687
You can just sit back and wait for the company

253
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
Sexy right they have a PR team out there

254
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
The company itself is trying to make

255
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
The case that it's going to be great

256
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,111
But if you short a company

257
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,951
You got to go out there and make the case that it's overvalued

258
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
Simon bet against China

259
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Education Alliance

260
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,071
But he was only going to make money at the stock price drops

261
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Soap

262
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,423
He shouted it to the world he posted a video of the empty building online

263
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
And he and his team wrote this really detailed report

264
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:24,895
That they put out they're basically saying the company was a fraud nothing really sit on 10 a.m. on November 30th 2000

265
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Ben 10

266
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,991
In within 2 hours of stock of the climb

267
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
He ended up making a bunch of ma

268
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,135
We have some you know how I feel and he was like good

269
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
Were you dancing did you pop champagne if you would just

270
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,047
Rocktown a company and made a fortune

271
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:48,703
And I really like 10 different times and I think basically he's a pretty even-keeled kind of guy but I also think

272
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
There's this other thing

273
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,823
On which is really another way in which the shorting is totally different from normal investing

274
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Your profit

275
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,663
Is really everyone else's loss

276
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,479
There were lots of other people who had invested in this car

277
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
Hoping the stock prices going to go up

278
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
And now thanks to some

279
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
In collapse

280
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
I get that it felt weird to celebrate

281
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,975
Yeah they've been bad for a minute I think there's a lot of investors that

282
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,071
You don't picking become blind sighted when we put out these reports and

283
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,655
You guys don't like us for losing the money

284
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,935
Will Saginaw

285
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,287
Your investment company has committed fraud and they should be letting the manager instead of us but

286
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
Most guys blame us

287
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
There are so many reasons

288
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,943
Not to become a short seller I mean

289
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:37,343
We have to be ready to be hated by everyone David we have to have some sort of special secret knowledge that were 1%

290
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
Picture of you leaving out the best thing

291
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
Is there a practical point

292
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Vanderlife

293
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
You can lose an infinite amount of money

294
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,399
Infinite I feel like we should pause on that infant

295
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,663

It has already been uneventful summer in Polish

300
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,559
Yeah between the 2020 debates

301
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
And the president's battle over immigration

302
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631

305
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,943
Crazy the NPR politics podcast

Subscribe

307
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,575
This is probably the major reason that people don't

308
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Short because

309
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,463
What you say that you are an optimist that you're buying stock in a company that you hope will go up

310
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,303
And it goes down right what's the most you can lose if you buy $100 worth of stock

311
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
You could lose

312
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
$100

313
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,167
But if you short sell it is completely

314
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
When you short a stock what you're actually doing is

315
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
You borrow the stock then you sell it in the hopes

316
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
That you can buy back at lower price and return it

317
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Got it

318
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,015
I know Jacob hate that we do this

319
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,831
Let's demonstrate

320
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
Robert you have an actual stop

321
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:21,791
Yeah and until I got this in the mail I didn't know that they still made my day anymore this is a paper

322
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,119
Stock certificate for a small Community Bank in Pennsylvania

323
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
It is a gift

324
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,935
To my daughters from their grandmother

325
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,751
Is there a supposed to pay for part of their education

326
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:34,079
So say I for whatever reason want to short this lovely little boy

327
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Here's how

328
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,967
First I need to borrow a share from someone who has one

329
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
At the end it back to you at some

330
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,039
Oh yeah it's for Mike

331
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
So I take this borrowed stock

332
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
And I sell it

333
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
So say the price right now is 10 bucks a share

334
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
I pocket that 10

335
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
Now I got to give you a share of the bank stock

336
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Back it's a

337
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,583
White denim stripe

338
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
So I wait

339
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
Hopefully the stock price drops

340
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,495
Then great I can buy one back cheap hopefully for like you know pennies

341
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
Any returns talk to you

342
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
And we're done

343
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
I made a profit

344
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Almost home book

345
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,663
That's the rosy scenario

346
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,943
For you

347
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
No the Evangelist put a Beat

348
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
Infinite amount of money scenario

349
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
Start the same way

350
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,159
I sell it for ten bucks and I wait

351
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
But this time instead of a stock price dropping

352
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
Let's say it goes up

353
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
And let's say it goes

354
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
Way up like

355
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,375
The bank has an incredible year some big investor comes in wanted

356
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
To expand and say the stock price

357
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
Goes up to like 50

358
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Now

359
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
You are screwed

360
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:40,127
David kestenbaum because you owe me that stock and you have to buy that stock

361
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,431
And it's a $50 you have lost

362
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
A ton of money or supposed

363
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
The stock

364
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Temple

365
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,295
100 hours to buy that stock

366
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,879
To return it to me or $200 or $500 or $1,000

367
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Siri

368
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
There is no

369
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
Limit to how much you can lose

370
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
You can lose an infinite amount of money

371
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Infinite

372
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
And how much is in a jar

373
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
$6.06

374
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
That's life

375
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,311
Hi David let's get out the checklist of things that we need to short a stock number one

376
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,847
The stock we think will go down

377
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
At no check we don't have that

378
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
Big pile of money

379
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
Don't have them

380
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,527
And number three number three heard about this from several people

381
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
We need lawyer

382
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:24,415
Angela tells that he had been sued four times and he told us about this one episode

383
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,255
Where I see you got really really really mad at

384
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
And his wife noticed this black truck Park

385
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Parked across the street

386
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
And she went out in the cell does Andrew Luck live here

387
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
And she said yes

388
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,799
Are they made comment we're friends off and they said the CEO's name they just sat up there

389
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
Outside Andrews house in that black truck

390
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:49,503
I called the CEO right there on the phone I'm like what do you think you're doing this is Wall Street this is business like what we're

391
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
World do you live in what do you think

392
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
What world do you live in

393
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,903
What did the guy say after you said that to him on the phone

394
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,487
Typical thuggery type stuff you don't know who I am

395
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
But what does that mean

396
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,327
I know you are you're the CEO of a publicly traded company

397
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Just

398
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Nonsense

399
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,727
Little David this is exactly the kind of drama

400
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
I was worried about

401
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
When we started this project

402
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Because

403
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
I'm a journalist

404
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Your journalist

405
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
How to get our DNA is to be neutral and the premise of this project

406
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,343
Is that we are going to bet against a company we're going to put our money on the line saying that some company is going to fail

407
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,231
Talk about it on the radio and they probably against the NPR ethics

408
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,791
So we spent a while in the office here talk

409
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
And we came up with a solution that I was actually really

410
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Excited

411
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
Instead of shortening

412
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Particular

413
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
We would short

414
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Every

415
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,799
We short the entire stock

416
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,615
Which is not as complicated as it sounds there's a way to do this

417
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
Let you know how their index funds which include like a

418
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
Tiny piece of lots and lots of stocks

419
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,295
You can buy those turns out you can also sort them

420
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
You can bet that the entire stock market

421
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,927
Is Rick back and forth about this we realized

422
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Did this

423
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,767
Is a perfect short because we weren't picking on some

424
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,863
Tiny little company where some CEO is going to call us up and try to bully us

425
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:14,495
We were picking on the biggest economic Target there is an entire world

426
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
The plan would be

427
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
Planet Money too short

428
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
America

429
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
We ran the idea by Sam

430
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
Yeah that's a terrible idea

431
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,015
Is very dangerous and it's a great way to lose lots of money

432
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
Basically going to the stock market as a reflection of

433
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Aggregate

434
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,927
Prophets of all of

435
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
The nation's public company

436
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,047
And every year companies make more profit

437
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,607
I was rushing American companies because

438
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,703
You know I think 40% of Revenue come from outside of the US Siri essentially

439
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
Shorting

440
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
Global

441
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Corporate profits

442
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:54,943
As long as populations are growing and there's Innovation companies going to make more money year and you're at

443
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
I'm shutting the whole planet

444
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,527
Yeah that's why I usually just work

445
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
Something have a name for what we are proposing

446
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
He called it

447
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
The Armageddon

448
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
We definitely had to do

449
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,535
Yeah I think he's trying to talk us out of it but Armageddon trade was perfect as you could picture

450
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
Some broker somewhere

451
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Sing

452
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,655
Everything Great and Powerful does ever exist in the world

453
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
Eventually goes away

454
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
Ottoman Empire

455
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Dawn

456
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
Roman Empire destroyed dinosaurs

457
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,079
Disappeared

458
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
Before the others

459
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Go with me on this

460
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
No one thought

461
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
If they would fail

462
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
And they did

463
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
America

464
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
Can't last forever

465
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623
Sound was not persuaded by the dinosaur on

466
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
I ran the idea also by Andrew

467
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
He was actually okay with

468
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
He said the stock market could go down

469
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:42,815
Time is right you guys could make

470
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,887
But he was not okay with the term

471
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Shredding amera

472
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
You really didn't like it

473
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,239
Do we have problems of course

474
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
We have a lot of moving parts

475
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
Price for shorting America

476
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
I just don't I don't like the way that sounds

477
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,919
We are hands-down

478
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,967
The greatest country in the world to invest in

479
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,015
We've really done an amazing thing in this

480
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
Is there a pep talk from a guy who

481
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,599
Specializes in shorting

482
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:09,695
Get listen that's what part of the amazing part about this country

483
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
Is the ability to Short

484
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,303
I mean how great is that that we live in a country cuz you know what

485
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
Me to buy stock

486
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
You don't like to talk

487
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,143
Beauty short the stock

488
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,959
And that's what we did

489
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
ETrade Elite line services

490
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Steven Pearson

491
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
I didn't do any Trading

492
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,407
Because shortened can potentially cost you so much I had to stick extra money

493
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
Not an infinite

494
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,735
2000 bucks of my own money

495
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Justin Bieber

496
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
And we're ready to go

497
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
I want to short something

498
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
All right

499
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
I want to short the entire stock market

500
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
The entire stock market

501
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
Well

502
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:52,959
Stevenson I'm not sure we can sure the entire stock market we can come close he said there's this thing that tracks the S&P 500

503
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
Has a little slice

504
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,519
Of the 500 largest stock

505
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
Let's try that

506
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
Minute later

507
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
All right

508
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,967
I've got that trade place for you

509
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
America

510
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Your bad news

511
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
Is now are good

512
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:13,183
Back by the end of the call the stock market gone down we made a little money how much $0.80

513
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:19,839
Start

514
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,911
The next show we're going to find out how Robert and David did

515
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,495
And they'll tell the story of what as far as we can tell

516
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
Was the very first short ever

517
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
It was a surprisingly long time ago

518
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:34,943
And it does not work out well for the guy trying to do it

519
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
Let's just say

520
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
He gets a mention on his gravestone

521
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,831

Today Show was produced by Jess Jiang originally

529
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
The rerun was produced by Rachel Cohn

530
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Robert Smith

531
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
I'm guessing about

532
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
And I'm McFadden

533
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,871
