1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,792
Where are we again

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,352
We're between Waterville and

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,632
Blue Rapids

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,704
And just to recap the folks at home

5
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:11,520
What happened previous episode of Planet Money go

6
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:15,872
Okay we purchased oil from json Brian's in cans

7
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,944
We bought a hundred barrels we transported it

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,296
To a pipeline the pipeline with the refinery the refinery turned it into diesel

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,368
And then it sent it across Kansas and so

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,672
What we are is in the middle of Kansas

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952
In the middle of cornfield

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
Looking for a

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
Hi this is Stacy Bennett

14
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:36,864
And I am Robert Smith this is it this is the last

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,632
Episode

16
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,704
About our oils Journey which is now Planet Money

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,008
Diesel and we're going to follow it all the way

18
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
The Council Bluffs Iowa

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
An into somebody's actual car

20
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,616
But right now

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,896
We're on the side of the road

22
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,200
Staring at a cornfield looking for

23
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:55,296
Little tiny signs telling us where are diesel is at this moment

24
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,368
Okay can you read any of those I'm not going down there

25
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,184
Oh wait okay warning underground cable that's not it

26
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:07,840
Oil pipeline is a lot harder than it sounds because pipeline travel in a straight line and roll

27
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,656
Do not say we spend a lot of time driving north south

28
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
East west

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
Pride intersect with a pipeline looking for one thing

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,920
Can I see good eyes Robert Smith it's a we become

31
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,760
The only tourist in history of Kansas to go down to take a picture of

32
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,064
Warning petroleum pipeline

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Oil derrick on it

34
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,952
Oh yeah but feel like a bright yellow sign and of course there's lightning in the distance

35
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
Always nice to see when you're following a pipeline but

36
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,816
What it means is it somewhere under our feet

37
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
At this moment

38
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,656
Is the Planet Money diesel fuel

39
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
Somewhere

40
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,240
Along with a whole bunch of other stuff

41
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
Yeah this is a question whether people have asked which is like wait what is is the point of oil just mixed in with everybody else

42
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
Elsa stuff

43
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Any answers

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,712
Yes

45
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,992
And no

46
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
Pipeline

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,344
Do not just carry one kind of product is totally

48
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
Blue my mind they can send

49
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
A batch of Airline fee

50
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,000
For a couple of hours they're feeding nothing but Airline fuel right behind it

51
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,816
They can do a batch of diesel and they can put it back

52
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
A regular gas they're all sort of

53
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
Right next to each other like train car

54
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,960
And it all ends up at a tank farm

55
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,800
In Council Bluffs Iowa just be sleep whole bunch of tanks in a field

56
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
This is where the gas gets stored and delivered to customers and here we meet Larry bows he is a pumper Gauger

57
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,760
With CHS Inc

58
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
That is the company that refined-r oil

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,416
And what that means is it Larry gets a sheet of paper that tells him when the different

60
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
Heinz

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,720
Petroleum fuel

62
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
Arrived and he diverted to the correct tank so it says basically on the list when Planet Money

63
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,144
Is diesel was going to ride

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,984
About 4 in the morning we're going to get a bats change to diesel in here

65
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
And when it does

66
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,312
It's going to set off an alarm here

67
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,712
Do you have to press a button to do that I'm going to run around here and open one bound to a tank and close the other valve

68
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
No no no no no no no

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,552
Your manually going to like

70
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Turn the wheel

71
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
How to take a lot of

72
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,696
But elbow grease to turn it I think you could do it

73
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
I'm serious

74
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,280
Apparently

75
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
Very easy to turn

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
And you know I doubt it used AC to stay up till 4 in the morning to get the sound of that

77
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,728
I know he only thinks I can

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,616
He's not sure I think we need some serious Planet Money Braun Robert only you can bring that

79
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,944
Getting up at 4 in the morning we both went to sleep

80
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,504
Try to think like where

81
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
Would the Planet Money

82
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
You will end up eventually

83
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,368
Probably in a tank

84
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
The next morning that came in at 4 in the morning

85
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,816
But we do know that these diesel tanks feed the Cenex brand gas station so

86
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:53,216
Masonic brand gas station only a few miles from where the pipeline in

87
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:59,616
We got to the Cenex station and we defended on this man Tom he's a math teacher in Council Bluff

88
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
If he was trying to fill up his car oil comes from well I guess my initial assumption to be sorry

89
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
Arabia possibly somebody you know one of those countries that produce oil ship United States so I guess you don't think about it very much

90
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
Not really I prefer to be from United States someplace but no I guess I do

91
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
Actually before you came from Kansas

92
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,823
Well that's great we were so excited to talk to Tom we were so excited

93
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,407
It's hard to explain to someone this entire project

94
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,735
In the two minutes that he's filling up his tank but we try

95
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:43,135
Will you bought our well I think so we wanted to like shake your hands and

96
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,695
You get 14.5 gallons free

97
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
A premium Kansas wheat back so we have to charge you

98
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,959
FedEx

99
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,567
The Cenex paid CHS the refiners the refiners paid the middleman the middleman

100
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Paid us

101
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,967
And we paid json

102
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,831
Who should have just voted straight to him and try to recoup our investment

103
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,159
But we did not we thought it would just be delighted

104
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,231
With the story but there is this problem

105
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,535
With doing this whole oil and gas series

106
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
And that is that the end of it

107
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Is so

108
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
Mundane

109
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
Filling up

110
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
The tank in your car

111
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
You don't even think about

112
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,311
It just sit there it's most boring thing

113
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
In the world and every time we tried to tell people

114
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
Look at the miracle

115
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,711
Really a miracle that just happened that some

116
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,015
Lincoln laid down their lives

117
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
Millions of years ago in chest

118
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
Weed in the ground

119
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
For Planet Money

120
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
To come along

121
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
And pull it out

122
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
Transforming in just a couple of days from this

123
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,279
Prehistoric stew really in Kansas

124
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
To drive a car in Iowa it is a mirror

125
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,607
Yes

126
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
It is a mere

127
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,471
All the problems that will causes and it causes some pretty big problems

128
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,287
It's a pretty miraculous substance

129
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,615
In fact trying to imagine a world without oil

130
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
Is almost impossible

131
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:14,783
Because not only is there oil in the tank of Tom's car there's also oil in the plastic in

132
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,575
Eschews

133
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
It's in his jacket

134
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
It's in a cell phone now that we've come to the end of our brief and very unprofitable journey through the

135
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:30,399
Oil Business we wanted to take a step back today on the show David kestenbaum and Jacob Goldstein asked

136
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
A simple and pretty profound question

137
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,359
What would the world be like without oil we'd like to say a quick thank you and share message

138
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,759
Which former Planet Money sponsor discover you check things all the time like your email or social media but discover ass

139
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,831
What about checking something as important as your credit score

140
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,927
Well discover makes it quick and easy with a Discover credit scorecard

141

145
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
Limitations apply

146
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,199
Jacob when we started doing the series on oil

147
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,991
There is one morning when I came into the off

148
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
I said to you

149
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,831
Have you ever thought how amazing it is

150
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,391
Did there was just a huge source of

151
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
Fuel and energy ripening

152
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
The more I thought about it the more I felt like

153
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
I don't know where we would be with

154
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,631
Could we have built this world that we live in today without fossa

155
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,679
Sophia cuz it does seem like this gif

156
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
Just from an energy

157
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,031
Yeah I had definitely never thought about it that way

158
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,871
I meant to be honest I never really thought about it at all but when you say the phrase

159
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,943
Fossil fuel my emotional reaction is

160
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
Negative you know I think

161
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
I think pollution I think climate change it so I don't know if I think what would the world be like if we had never had fossil fuel

162
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,975
I don't know maybe we'll be better off if we didn't have them you know what we are now minus the climate

163
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,791
When I was looking for people to help us think through this

164
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
I sorta got two categories

165
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
Have responses

166
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
One was like

167
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,983
No thank you I'm a serious historian I do not do speculative alternative hits

168
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
But the response was

169
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
That is a totally fascinating question

170
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
That is the correct response

171
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,663
Let me talk to two people in particular

172
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,735
I'm a David Keith, professor of

173
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:25,343
Whatever it's called it's called Applied Physics at Harvard also public policy

174
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,743
Here's the second person we talked to for some reason the can you introduce yourself portion of the interview was causing some

175
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
Can you introduce

176
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,119
To whom to everybody who's listening to Planet Money

177
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,823
I'm almost here I'm a professor of economics and history at Northwestern University David and Joel

178
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
Well, this question from different dress

179
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,175
David is a scientist kind of an energy nerd

180
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,967
Things about fossil fuels a lot

181
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,551
On the one hand I work on climate change for half my life

182
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
Simon fighting the fossil-fuel world forever

183
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
But also

184
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
I know how the energy system works

185
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,023
And so

186
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
I don't feel my

187
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
Fossil fuels he says they are an amazing Source event

188
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,167
David is a scientist

189
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
John MacArthur on the other hand

190
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
Things about the the Great

191
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
Sweep of hist

192
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,359
30 set the stage we said ok historian tell us what life was like

193
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,663
Before people really started using fossil

194
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,711
In like the 1700

195
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Lancer

196
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Not good

197
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Terrible

198
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
Lots of hard work

199
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,623
Back-breaking work

200
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,719
Always a danger of not having enough to

201
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
At to eat

202
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,327
A threat of famine looming over

203
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
Once life everyday

204
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
Infant mortality that was reaching over 300 or 350 per thousand

205
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
Third of all newborns die

206
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
A third of all newborns died

207
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,199
In infancy or before the 8th day HD

208
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
Swangas

209
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
Darrell bock

210
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
You can look at this and say what we needed with science

211
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
But you could also see this as an energy

212
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
You want some source of energy to cook

213
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Food or heat your house

214
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
Basically you got trees

215
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
You cut down a tree

216
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
Chop it up

217
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
Burn the wood

218
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
We were just living off the surface

219
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
David Keith the scientist he said

220
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,471
Trees are not that great as far as sources of energy

221
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
I don't think these are kind of spread out

222
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,543
You know like there's a

223
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
The tree here then you got to go

224
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Pain feet to the next one

225
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:28,479
For another thing he says when you cut a tree down you got to wait you know a hundred years for another one to grow again

226
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
He says compare that to Cole

227
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,295
Coal companies

228
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Huge

229
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Sex scene

230
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
Were you can just dig it out by

231
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
Individual people with

232
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Hose

233
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
Can pick it up by

234
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
Naked

235
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
Concentrated source of energy

236
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
Geographically constant

237
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:48,703
Sokol is sort of like millions of years of wood that was just stacked in the basement there

238
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
Well in fact

239
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,871
Sort of like billions of years of what essentially literally what it is

240
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
Jacob my favorite slang for oil

241
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Is dinosaur juice

242
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,551
They may be an atom of dinosaur in oil but it's most

243
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:07,135
Ferns. There's an atom of dinosaur

244
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
I'm like 50%.

245
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,767
When a small engine runs really fast to waste

246
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,583
Fight-or-flight easy call

247
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,887
Given all this we ask them

248
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Where would we be today

249
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
If there had been no fossil

250
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
Biofuels in the grass

251
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
How would history have

252
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
Basil leaf

253
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Would we have been

254
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
We ran through some key historic Moana

255
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,735
SNS both of them how things might have gone in this

256
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
Parallel universe where fossil fuels did not

257
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,599
What are the first really big moments

258
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
4 fossil fuels

259
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
Comes in the 1800

260
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Train

261
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
Railroad coal powered steam engine

262
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
Pulling all these people in all this stuff

263
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Maybe you're like

264
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Trains

265
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:51,935
Obviously I'm not like that right like trains are clearly

266
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,567
A huge moment like the moment when the modern world comes charging at a casino for the first time

267
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,871
You can travel over land faster than a horse

268
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
This is a huge

269
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Breakthrough

270
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,991
Could you have railroads if you didn't have fossil fuels like what would have had

271
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
Absolutely

272
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,111
America only became more than half also fuel

273
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
Roughly in 19

274
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,743
Before that we had an enormous input of wind powered energy

275
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
If you think about that big steam engine

276
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Moving across

277
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Western North America

278
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,911
What are those are powered by wood Top by Cole

279
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
Add some of the more running off

280
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Most of them

281
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
What was the dominant fuel

282
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
If you power the railroads off

283
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,127
What I should get a cut down an enormous number

284
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
We got this

285
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,551
We got down like 97% of the original forest in the lower 48

286
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
United States we basically got it all

287
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
So

288
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
We were going to run into some limits

289
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
No cap

290
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
That clearly sounds

291
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
Very bad butt

292
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
You don't think about the economic

293
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,911
In the parallel universe where there's no fossil fuel

294
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
Would would have been really precious

295
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Really

296
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Expensive

297
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,823
And so you would have lots of people getting into the woods

298
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
Growing new trees to tell the word

299
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
Any says thinking about Railroad

300
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
There were alternate

301
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,807
Like we could have relied more on Rivers you know maybe would have built a bunch of Canal Zone

302
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,903
Economist of actually studied what would have happened without railroads

303
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
It's not that bad

304
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Getting around is a little

305
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Pentecostal

306
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:25,375
Turns out it is more expensive but not so much more

307
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
That we would have had completely too because we would have remained some kind of medieval economy we would have been

308
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,103
A different economy with much more canals

309
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
Wait what would what would have powered the boats on the

310
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
Do it always with you we would have

311
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
Who it works vacuum with with horse

312
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,599
That's hot that's how can I how can I borrow

313
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
That sounds

314
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,463
It doesn't it's a little bit slower but it is

315
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
What's the value of time

316
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
For those of you who don't know

317
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,375
The horses when they were alongside pulling the barges.

318
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
Motorcycle

319
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,983
There were lots of other paths that we could have gone to

320
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
And yet I mean some of them seem a little bit

321
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,127
But that's just cuz we're locked into thinking about the world as it is

322
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,687
Okay so trains that run on wood

323
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
We got more canals

324
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
I can see that while I can see how you could

325
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,599
But they at least have this big thing right

326
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
Electricity what how do you do it like

327
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
You're that really feels like

328
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
The big one right like a sinner this

329
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,559
And it comes on just not that long after trains take off

330
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
1882

331
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
Thomas Edison built the first

332
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
Central Electric Power

333
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,543
Right here in man has it's a few miles from where we are. It gives 82 people electrical

334
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
It is the beginning of electric

335
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,151
End-of-course Edison power plant ran on coal

336
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
How else would you have run that power play

337
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,319
We would have had to get to generate much more electricity from water

338
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
Would you run it off with us

339
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
Hudson River

340
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,535
The only way we would have had to build dams on the Hudson River to run electricity we could have generated in Waze

341
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,631
Did we never fear if you tried liking title Mills title Mills

342
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
What are title

343
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,471
Title meals are milsim actually used in

344
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
In the middle

345
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
They use the movement of

346
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
Water enhancer the tides

347
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,943
Enso demille's stuck in coastal Waters

348
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:20,831
It's moving One Direction When the tide is in moving the other direction with the tightest I doubt they create Tower

349
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
To take lunar power

350
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
Extension Luna power yes

351
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,559
Get to know if I actually believe this idea he was explaining but then you called it lunar power

352
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,631
Hippie I say you got

353
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
Still what are you going to do about

354
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,007
Yeah that's like the next big one right it's just a few decades after Edison

355
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
Henry Ford comes out

356
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,847
What time before going to do if there's no gasoline

357
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Two words

358
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Electric cars

359
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
I've got electric car

360
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
Quite advanced

361
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
Go suck a hundred miles and a charge

362
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
And was built in 1909

363
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,623
That's the baker elect

364
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,183
It's an electric car from like in early 1900

365
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,279
It's Jay Leno and its YouTube video driving around in this old

366
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
Car looks like I don't like

367
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,095
Box on wheels

368
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
Does it look like what Cinderella took

369
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
Back to the

370
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,263
Horseless Carriage

371
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
What's not prom

372
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,871
Wake electric cars were a thing back then

373
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Then Henry Ford's wife

374
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
She

375
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,735
Drove an electric car she liked it better than her husband

376
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,271
Invention that ran off gasoline

377
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,599
There is a problem with electric cars even today there's a problem

378
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
They just don't go there

379
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,671
Even with monitor batteries

380
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
We asked Jomo care about

381
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
Battery Technology turns out to be

382
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
And difficult

383
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,887
Imagine imagine

384
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:42,495
A world in which we know we were not terribly rebuilding battery switch battery only

385
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:49,151
I'm about 40 miles okay well then we would have had to build a network in which every 40-mile you

386
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
Stop your car you

387
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,967
Loosen two screws

388
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
Take out the old battery put in it

389
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,319
Prestige Audi want to keep Tina tagging along

390
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,671
I would have been bit of a hassle but also his own houses

391
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
What about this one

392
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Airplane

393
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
How do you do airplane

394
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
You don't

395
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
Not for a while

396
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
Again though he says not a disaster

397
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
You know you can still take a boat across the ocean

398
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,263
And maybe there would be blimps

399
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
We did for a while

400
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
Experiment with a

401
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
Technology that actually

402
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,735
It work reasonably well in the end endoso identity

403
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Blimp

404
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
Yuan zhuo bonded for a while

405
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,111
You know the Empire State Building

406
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,671
The tower was built as a docking place

407
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,439
It's for blimps

408
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,279
Which I look like when I'm flying to JFK I'm like I got to get a card

409
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
I got an hour to get wherever I'm going to imagine like

410
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
What if my blimka just Dock at the Empire State

411
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,055
In many ways it's an extremely Pleasant way of traveling

412
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,615
Can I ask you a totally random one

413
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
Would we have gone to the Moon

414
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,735
I don't know I probably not

415
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
So what

416
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,063
Talking to Joel

417
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,111
I actually kind of came around a bit

418
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
Like maybe things would be fine if there has been no fun

419
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:08,255
Got lots more dams hydropower

420
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
What you're going to need for your life

421
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,887
And Joe said he'll because energy would be more scarce and work

422
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,423
Did we were just concerned

423
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
We built smaller houses

424
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Together

425
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
Okay you want to go to Europe you just get on a boat and takes a week

426
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,871
You hate blind

427
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
You don't believe it I believe it

428
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
Okay that's what

429
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
Then we talked to David

430
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Keep the physicist

431
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,879
And he frankly you the less optimistic

432
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
Cuz he done the math on a lot of these

433
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
Like when we asked him

434
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
If we damn all the rivers

435
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
How much electricity does a taxi

436
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
If your damn

437
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
Do you want the terror what units

438
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
Yeah yeah

439
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
You got all the rivers in the world you get a

440
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
A few terawatts

441
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,311
Currently Humanity uses like 16 or 18

442
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,639
To all the rivers in the world or only maybe a quarter

443
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,687
Of the total energy were using today

444
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,503
And David Keith racist problem that I had not even thought

445
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,575
What are you going to build those damned out

446
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Concrete

447
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Deal

448
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
Both of those things require a lot of

449
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
The energy to make

450
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
You know how we make steel

451
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
Any very very hot furnace

452
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
Heated by

453
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Fossil fuel

454
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,143
And by the way thinking about trains he said sure you could run the trains on wood

455
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,727
But how you going to build the tracks in the train would you going to make those out

456
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
And on top of that

457
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,079
All these all these advances were talking about

458
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,127
Come from scientific knowledge

459
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,967
And we got that scientific knowledge in part because of fossil

460
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,783
Because we had all this easy energy

461
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
But let us advance to a place

462
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,903
Where they were people scientists and Engineers who had time to

463
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
Sit around and tinker and figure things out

464
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
Even wind power

465
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
When power does get you

466
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
Kenza Tara

467
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,375
You could power all of modern civilization

468
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
But the question is

469
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
Could you build modern wind turbine

470
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,543
Without the kind of fossil fuel economy to get you started

471
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
PetSmart winter advisory

472
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
Fantastic things

473
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
Huge steel shaft

474
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
You know almost hundred meter long blades made out of

475
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,783
Fiberglass beautifully shaped

476
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:13,183
What can you build something up just good enough you know what to get you the electricity you needed back in the 18 hundreds to do whatever the next

477
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Maybe

478
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
If a attic central question

479
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,815
Could we have tunneled through

480
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,631
Turn an old biofield a civilization

481
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,703
To a post fossilization like we now want to get to

482
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
Without fossil

483
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:30,847
And if we could tunnel through what would be the best way it might be that a gradual development of wind power is it

484
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,127
Wind power you can just

485
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
Incrementally doing better

486
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
After all we've had wind machine

487
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,295
And wait the question we've been asking for this whole show

488
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
You know how would history have unfolded without

489
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,671
It boils down to something really

490
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,999
Are we where we are today because we're lucky

491
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
Or because we're

492
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
We asked Joel and David both where they stood

493
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,887
Domo care told us that

494
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,935
Based on his entire career

495
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
His life's work

496
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,519
He thinks we are where we are

497
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
Because we're

498
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,127
What's driving modern history is not

499
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,431
Fuel or fossil fuel or what

500
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,991
What is driving it is human ingenuity

501
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,599
And you would have come up with an alternative set of solutions

502
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,416
And it would not have been

503
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,720
I think noticeably worse

504
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
Then the one we ended up with

505
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
And in some ways

506
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
Better

507
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,328
That's my boy

508
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
David Keith our scientist

509
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
Started out sounding very

510
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,240
As much as I'm an energy can I sync all about Anna

511
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
The ultimate power source

512
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Is people working cooperatively

513
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,368
Actor David Keith was done praising Humanity for our incredible ability to work together and be innovative

514
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:48,416
Keaton 170 that fossil fuels

515
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Had really

516
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Mini SED

517
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,328
Shirt eventually we would have gotten to a world something like the world we live in today

518
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
But it would have taken me

519
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
Things would have gone worse

520
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
How much slower

521
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,216
My testicles is like 10 times

522
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Much lower

523
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Eye Optical

524
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
Yeah

525
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
Does it talk about

526
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
Wow that's a big deal

527
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
Yeah

528
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Now I mean it's it's

529
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
Getting access to

530
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
2 fossil fuels has such a

531
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,064
Sort of Taken

532
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
Hundreds more years to go

533
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
Yeah

534
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Turn off

535
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,488
The truth is we do live in a world

536
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,816
David Keith says fossil fuels have given

537
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
In fact they brought us to a point

538
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,448
We now have the technology to live without fossil

539
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,264
There's a lot of detail questions about how you do

540
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
I know take some

541
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
You could get rid of fossil

542
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:44,992
They said the world would look basically the same

543
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:50,368
Dave and Jacob that is a lovely way to end

544
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,696
The oil series but there was one part of the journey

545
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
That

546
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
Stacy and I wanted

547
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
To share with you

548
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:03,680
Before this is over and it's a part that Stacy didn't talk about very much because she was somewhat in

549
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,520
Every single time we interviewed someone

550
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
Stacy had a very

551
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,640
Unusual line of questioning

552
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,736
Different issues Chinese guy Vince Bankston who works at the refinery

553
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:21,344
And she tried to link our oil with a certain delicious ice cream tree

554
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
Is there corn around here

555
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,928
Sophie Korn

556
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,464
Feed corn

557
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,048
Is in cattle feed corn is which referring to a lot of us

558
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,608
Crushed cacao food yes

559
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,912
So if we like drink a milkshake

560
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,496
Would that potentially vehicle that was fed with

561
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,312
Feed corn that was fertilized with oil

562
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,104
Yes drink

563
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
AR

564
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
Oil in a milkshake

565
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,736
Every single time.

566
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
Okay the milkshake obsession

567
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,184
This is from a very iconic scene in a great movie about American oil called There Will Be Blood

568
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
In the scene Daniel Day-Lewis is explaining

569
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,048
How he can steal his neighbors oil

570
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,584
We basically a giant straw

571
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
It's an amazing scene

572
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
Milkshake

573
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,360
Dart board

574
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,176
And then he beat them to death with a bowling pin I think

575
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,040
I tried to explain to Stacy this is a metaphor

576
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:28,928
But you were very insistent that we show up at a Dairy Queen in Council Bluffs and try and drink our own milkshake

577
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,024
You're making fun of you but you know that this is exactly where the world should end right

578
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,120
Yes

579
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
It should end

580
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
With me drinking your milkshake

581
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,008
Do what you did with me drinking your milkshake

582
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
3 2 1 go

583
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
Arena condos because

584
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
It's so good

585
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,160
This is going to take awhile so we're going to toss it back

586
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,816
Did David and Jacob for the end of the show let us know what you think you can send it to email we are planning

587
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,840
At money at NPR.

588
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
Where you can find us on Twitter or Facebook the show today was produced by Jess Jiang and Nick Fountain getting to the meat

589
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,920

This Is the End

598
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,352
The end of my time

608
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
It was you

609
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,552
You taught me how to do this

610
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Thank you

611

You know I mean when I came here I didn't know how to make pie

613
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,280
That's because I worked with you and now I know how to make

614
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,816
