00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,120
Just a quick note Today Show originally ran in 2014

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,912
You do have a little update at the end

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,472
There's nothing that comes up in the news

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,752
CEO pay

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,568
The stories often include someone complaining that

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Too high

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,712
Sometimes pointing out that it would take an average worker two centuries to earn what a top

8
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
Paid CEO makes in a single

9
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:25,088
Then there's somebody on the other side defending CEO pay

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,208
And that usually about where the stories at just people arguing back and forth about numbers

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,512
Today we have an actual story about Co

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,608
A story with a beginning a middle and an end it's the story of two guys

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:40,192
To Outsiders who try to cut the pay of the CEO

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,752
A small pneumatic Tool company on Long Island

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,664
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob Goldstein and I'm David kestenbaum this is a piece we just finished for This American Life

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064

It takes an unusual person to wage a war against the CEO it is

23
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,840
Do you have the success or just solo

24
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,400
And Tim Staples was definitely an outside

25
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
He lived in a small town Laporte Indiana

26
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
In a small house

27
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
We went to visit

28
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,360
In the dining room there's a broken Dungeons & Dragons pinball

29
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
Tim tried to fix it

30
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
Here it is now

31
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Sad

32
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
I made a boo-boo when I

33
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
Write out the

34
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
Display the largest disaster

35
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:06,976
Upstairs there's a room filled with old and rare board games

36
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,768
Timmie's to buy them at auction

37
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
And resell them

38
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,632
My favorite was a game called war in the Pacific which apparently nobody really plays

39
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
It got 3000 pieces

40
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
50 pages of rules

41
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
Tim a little business out of

42
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
He's good at picking the right games

43
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,824
Buying cheap and selling them for

44
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
Eventually Tim tried his hand at the stock

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
He used a computer

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
Pick out stocks you thought were undervalued

47
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,064
He still has this computer today and just so you have the right image in your head

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
It's the kind of computer you find sitting out on the side

49
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
It's got a floppy disk drive

50
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:40,256
It's actually connected to a dot matrix printer still works

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,352
Over the years he did well in the stock

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Really well

53
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,704
Well enough that he was never going to have to work a regular job

54
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,032
Sometime in the mid-nineties Tim came across this one company

55
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,592
He'd end up investing hundreds of thousands of dollars

56
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,664
It was a small company based on Long Island

57
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Call p&f Industries

58
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,992
It made pneumatic tools

59
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
You can actually buy him at Home Depot

60
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,576
Have you ever used one of the tools

61
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,368
I don't believe so no

62
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,416
Tim just like the company's numbers

63
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,232
It was a small company where you could understand everything about it

64
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
Pmf seemed like a good deal

65
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,840
But over the years something begin to nod

66
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
The salary of the CEO

67
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Richard Hart

68
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,984
Roughly 1 and 1/2 million dollars a year total compensation

69
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
That a lot

70
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
One and a half million

71
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,384
Is outrageous and outlandish

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Timothy rabbit similar company

73
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,736
Some of the same industry some of the same Geographic

74
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
You can find anywhere this year with pay

75
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Even half

76
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,904
Now if you just own a few shares of a company stock

77
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,184
Can you take the CEOs of

78
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
There isn't much you can

79
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
But if you are more

80
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Well liked

81
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
And by the fall of 2009

82
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
Tim around 180 thousand

83
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,936
Cousin shares I came down 5%

84
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,984
5% of the whole company

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
5% the entire company

86
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,336
His stake was worth more than half-a-million dollars

87
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
And it turned out

88
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
Tim had an ally in this fight

89
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
A guy with a little more experience

90
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
Skyrim the Hedgehog

91
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:11,648
I'm Andrew Shapiro on President portfolio manager of Lawndale Capital Management

92
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
About 8%

93
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,744
Hinton didn't work together directly

94
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
They had buried if

95
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,583
Answer with a by-the-book investor

96
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Find a

97
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,143
Semi obscure military lose

98
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,727
We deploy with what we do we deploy what I call

99
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
The Powell Doctrine

100
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
Of Investments

101
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,615
And I try to take on targets

102
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
Where I can mount overwhelming Force

103
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,015
4 years Andrew had been arguing that the CEO was grossly overpaid

104
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
Over 110 year. He says

105
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,903
Richard Horowitz took home 13.5 million dollars

106
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,487
That's more than twice with the entire company made in profits over that

107
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
Sometimes when people complain about CEO

108
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,119
They talk about it as if the money's coming out of the pocket

109
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Ordinary work

110
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
That is not how timid

111
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
Every dollar the CEO gets

112
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Is a dollar less proper

113
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,567
A dollar less for Tim

114
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
And Andrew

115
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
And all the other stock quote

116
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,943
They overpaid CEOs taking money out of the shareowners pocket

117
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:11,551
You're not in it because he wouldn't it be wouldn't it feel great of CEOs weren't

118
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
Hate so much more than everyone else

119
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:18,207
I am I am doing this to make a return on our capital

120
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
If you think CEOs are overpaid Rich guys

121
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
Your best hope maybe other rich

122
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,447
People like Damon Andrew with enough money to buy a bunch of stock and

123
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,543
Try to cut the CEO's pay in hopes of becoming even richer themselves

124
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
Weave course wanted to know what the CEO Richard Harwood

125
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
We tried to get him

126
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,199
I got a bunch of talks with the company

127
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
In the end it's declined to be in

128
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
But because this is a public company

129
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
There are plenty of recordings

130
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
Public companies have what are called quarterly earnings

131
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
For investors

132
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
Really anyone who wants to listen

133
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,863
Good day everyone think I'm holding a safe conference will begin with a presentation and then

134
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,167
Operator starts the car

135
00:05:59,423 --> 00:05:59,935
Is the man himself

136
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
Richard Harlow

137
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,495
Firstly

138
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,895
What's the company's revenue from continuing operations what's 14164000

139
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
Listen to a lot of earnings calls like this

140
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
Usually they are incredibly.

141
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,623
Analyst from Big Banks asking super specific things about the company's balance sheet

142
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
Remember

143
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
PNF is a small company

144
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
And some of these calls

145
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
There are only two people funding and requests

146
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,863
To people who feel the CEO is grossly overpaid

147
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
Andrew enter

148
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
They that the CEO whatever they want

149
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
Here's one Exchange

150
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567
Our next question is from Timothy stable if your line is open

151
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:41,407
Tim is asking about this key thing that used to determine a CEO salary

152
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
It's called a compensation

153
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,271
It looks at what CEOs at comprable companies

154
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,367
Pmf Industries has hired an external firm to do what

155
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
Kim wanted.

156
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,023
Still waiting on a report from that outside for a ride

157
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,119
I can't tell you why I don't know what the company I mean

158
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
I don't like and a Black Russian

159
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
I don't have the knowledge shampoo

160
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Okay

161
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
Okay

162
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,479
You know this is a firm that's two weeks early now that there's a firm is doing an analysis right

163
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
I can't I don't know

164
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Handsome

165
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,743
I can't comment any further and this is a 2

166
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
To private school

167
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Tutu mean second

168
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,399
We talked about the results of cubed

169
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Policeman

170
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
Composite numbers Factor

171
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,943
Well that's fine but executive salaries are relevant to the Future profitability and and whatnot

172
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
Any further questions ask you to

173
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,623
That would have been helpful if you would simply said we're not going to talk about executive conversation. That's what you're essentially saying

174
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
Hilton

175
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
I'm frustrated right now Richard

176
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
Okay you'll have

177
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Thank you

178
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,191
Our next question is from Andrew Shapiro in your line is open

179
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
There are a lot of calls

180
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
CEO salary set by a company's Board of director

181
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,919
Shapiro suspected Richard Horowitz it packed aboard with his cronies

182
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
People who paid him more than you deserve

183
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,551
Andrew hired a private detective and did some digging himself

184
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,927
He discovered that in fact several board members play golf at the same country club is the CEO

185
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,999
The Glen Oaks Country Club of

186
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,791
Westbury New York

187
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
Glen Oaks Country Club of Old Westbury New York

188
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,727
Nothing illegal or maybe even surprising about these guys belonging to the same country

189
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,543
Still what would General Colin Powell

190
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
He can get them off the board

191
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
Getting someone do when a company's board turns out to be varied

192
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,991
Disconnect wonky little detail is not the kind of thing that fits on a protest sign

193
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
What's the thing that really matter

194
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Board members are elected

195
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,855
All the shareholders

196
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391
But the thing is

197
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
It's hard to get candidates on the ballot

198
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
Any shareholder can nominate

199
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,863
But the board decides whether that person should be listed on the ballot

200
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,471
It would be like if the members of Congress got to decide who got to run for Congress

201
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,567
There are ways around this you can try to change a company's bylaws or you can

202
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
Wait something call the proxy

203
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
But that's expensive and even more difficult

204
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
Both Tim and Andrew took that first approach

205
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Nominate someone for the board and

206
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
Hope the board takes her suggest

207
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,135
Andrew in his by-the-book way offered up some names

208
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
And Tim

209
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
Tim Sycamore unconventional

210
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Here's the letter he wrote

211
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
And filed with the SEC

212
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
We had them

213
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,119
Pursuant to article 3 section 12

214
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
Penis bylaws

215
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:47,263
Please be advised that at the next meeting of stockholders at which directors will be elected

216
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
I intend to nominate myself for election as a director

217
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,895
Tim was trying to get himself on the board

218
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
You never been on a

219
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Bored Button

220
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:55,967
This is like a board game

221
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
There were set of rules and they allowed for the

222
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
So why not

223
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Very truly yours

224
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
Timothy John Stables private investor

225
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
That kind of outrageous things to do

226
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
You know I was so

227
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,303
Incensed I figured why not why not

228
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Why not see how they respond

229
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Request that they put me on the board

230
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,679
And see how they handle it

231
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,007
Tim and Andrew went to the company's annual meeting on Long Island

232
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
Want to try to convince the board to put their candidates on the ballot

233
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,151
It was the first time Andrew Shapiro and Richard Horowitz

234
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
The CEO had met in

235
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:31,039
It actually was quite crowded every seat in the table was full and there was

236
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:37,439
The paid for advisor standing around the periphery of the table outside you know

237
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
In the room but along the wall

238
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
Where was the CEO

239
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
I'll be sitting directly across the table from

240
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
Oh

241
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
It must be awkward what's it like

242
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,007
I was not awkward tonight until I go into these rooms

243
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
With the distinct View

244
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
That I am an owner of this business and you members of the board of directors or my agents

245
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,039
And you work for me you don't work for mr. Horowitz

246
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
You don't work for management

247
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,135
Management works for you

248
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
The board

249
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:12,511
And the board you work for me and all of the other shareholders

250
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
The board did not seem immediately suede

251
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,167
And it's easy to imagine how this whole thing might feel on the other side

252
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
If you're say Richard Harwood

253
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,055
You got two guys who have never even worked in the tool biz

254
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
Telling you how they think the business

255
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
That your father build-up should be right

256
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,991
And how much you should be paid and who should be on your board

257
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:38,623
4/10 tables what had started out as a rational investment something just based on numbers

258
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
I become emotion

259
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
It becomes something hard to let go of

260
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
At some point in this whole fight

261
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,559
Tim's letters to the company took on a different tone

262
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
He got rid of the lawyer who'd been better

263
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
Some of the letters starts have words in all caps

264
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,727
Some start to feel weirdly into

265
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
What is address just to Richard

266
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,103
And uses phrases like I was at the end of my rope and

267
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Goodness knows I tried a different course

268
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,967
And then in the summer of 2010

269
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
What's a decade

270
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,807
After 10 first bought stock and pmf industries

271
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
Something finally went his way

272
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
There's a change on the board

273
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:16,255
The two guys who played golf at the same country club is the CEO step down from the committee

274
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:22,911
Also one of the people Andrew had recommended for the board got put on the ballot and elected

275
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:27,007
And a year-and-a-half later we haven't noticed this is an incredibly long process

276
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
It finally happened

277
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
The thing that almost never happen

278
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
The board of pmf

279
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,663
Did what and ruin someone

280
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
They cut Richard Horowitz his base salary

281
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Buy a lot

282
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,319
From $975,000

283
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
To

284
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,671
Cut of over $300,000

285
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
It actually made the news

286
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
At least a little corner of the new

287
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
An article in a publication called the institutional

288
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:57,215
An expert in that article said it was the first time he'd ever seen shareholders get aboard

289
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,263
To cut the pay of a sitting CEO

290
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,079
Tim Staples of course was it elated about

291
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
Was so fantastic

292
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
Stop green felt like

293
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
I had

294
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,503
Serve to affect this change

295
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,039
Is that I was an agent of change

296
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Crelike

297
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,135
Me from LaPorte Indiana typing my angry little letters

298
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
You know

299
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
Used to be sound board games

300
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,303
I just got to see you a salary cut by $320,000

301
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
Yeah yeah that's how it felt

302
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,935
That feeling did not last

303
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
It turns out

304
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,311
That new contract also made it easier for Richard Horowitz to get a bigger bonus

305
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
And in 2012

306
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,711
Even though Horwitz is base pay it been cut he actually ended up making more money

307
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
Then he had the previous year

308
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
And then

309
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
Richard Harwood got a raise

310
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,879
The board boosted is base pay by $50,000

311
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,719
And they also raise the bonus percentage is so he'll be able to earn even more

312
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
The bonus

313
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,559
The company only let us talk to one person on its side

314
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
But it was someone we definitely wanted to hear from

315
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,679
The board member that Andrew Shapiro

316
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
I'd recommend it

317
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,031
Met him one afternoon at a business Club at the top of a tall building in

318
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
His name is Howard Brownstein

319
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,407
And he told us he thinks Richard Horowitz his pay is reasonable

320
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,759
Yeah are you I would say to you that based on the work that the

321
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,599
Comp committee did as they reported it to us and as we listen to it

322
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,975
That the compensation is within the realm of reasonableness for our company and how it's doing

323
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
And

324
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,791
The money we make for the shareholders

325
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,351
We have brown Stein about that compensation

326
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
Study that Tim asked about on the

327
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,703
The study that compares Richard Horowitz

328
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,495
Pay to the CEOs of other companies

329
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,103
And we read Brown send this letter Tim wrote asking the board to release details from the

330
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
Airport

331
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,663
Ask it's probably the wrong

332
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Tim Wright

333
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
I demand

334
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
In all caps

335
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
And then at the end

336
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
Also in caps

337
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
I have waited long enough

338
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
I am done waiting

339
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Well

340
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
You know but

341
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,023
Misha Staples obviously it has been able to find the caps lock key on his typewriter

342
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:02,655
Look generally in in my world when somebody demand something is because they have a legal right to it

343
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
He may say he demands it

344
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
But the fact that you guys have a right to it

345
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,287
So what you really is

346
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,615
Where were you really meant when he said I demand it is I really really want it

347
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
I got it

348
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
It's okay

349
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
You can't have it

350
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Next

351
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
He's one of the owners of the

352
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:22,623
Sure yes but the owners of the company only have the rights that they have

353
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
The rights the law gives them

354
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,463
It doesn't give them more than that

355
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Since peanut wouldn't release that study

356
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,839
We asked a company that analyzes CEO cup

357
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
Compensation to take a look

358
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
The company is called a cooler

359
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,983
They do a lot of work for a companies were trying to figure out how much to pay theirs

360
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
Here is what ekwill are found

361
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,871
Among roughly 200 companies of similar size

362
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,943
Richard Horowitz is pay rank near the very top

363
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,735
In the top 7%

364
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
More than twice the app

365
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
Heckler also looked at a smaller group of company

366
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
Is that like tnf

367
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,927
Ironwood called the industrial goods sector

368
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
There were 13 companies in that crew

369
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,535
The top paid CEO was Richard heart

370
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,839
In other words according to the study

371
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,167
Richard Horowitz is one of the highest paid or D highest paid

372
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
Tim Staples lost

373
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,567
But he don't shares and PNF for most of his adult life

374
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,871
When you've been in something that long

375
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
It can be hard to know when to walk away

376
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
What happens next you going to keep at this

377
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
The question him

378
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
I thought about that

379
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:32,255
Yeah yeah I want I want the company to know that I'm not going anywhere

380
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
Everything about giving up

381
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
No really

382
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
Giving up meme

383
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,567
I can tell you what giving up looks like

384
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
After we talked to Tim

385
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Had a momentary cash crunch

386
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
Had to sell all his share

387
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,711
The company bought the

388
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,503
And as part of the deal

389
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,599
Tim promised not to buy any shares of pmf Industries for 3 years

390
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
It turns out

391
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
Really hard to cut a CEO's pay

392
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
Even if you own 5% of the company

393
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
Now he has even less power to do anything

394
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Now

395
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
Tim Staples

396
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
It's just like everybody else

397
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:18,335
That is how the story ended when

398
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
We first reported it two years ago

399
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:26,527
We will check back in with Tim and Andrew to see what's happened since then after the break

In the past week or so we called up Tim and Andrew to see what's happening

407
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,919
Tim reminded us that he is still banned from owning pmf shares

408
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
But that man

409
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
Expires in October

410
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,599
And she told us it is more likely than not that he will invest in the company again he will buy stock

411
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
Andrew for his part said

412
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
He is actually increased

413
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,999
His investment in the company since we did the story

414
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,303
He bought more stock and he told us

415
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,119
You think the executive pay situation has gotten better

416
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
Or at least less bad

417
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,727
He went from excessive and egregious compensation

418
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,311
Down to only excessive compensation

419
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,127
Also Andrews still dialed into those earning

420
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,199
And it is pretty much incompetence

421
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,855
And he responsible for the day of this year

422
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999

Today's rerun was produced by our intern Edwards soccer field

433

You want to leave you with one of their little detail in Tim's de buses dining room right next to the broken Dungeons & Dragons pinball

434
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
Time machine there was a piano that did

435
