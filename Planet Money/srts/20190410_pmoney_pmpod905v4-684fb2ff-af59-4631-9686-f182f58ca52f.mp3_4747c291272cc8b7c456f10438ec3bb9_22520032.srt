1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:02,816
So last month I was in South America

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:06,144
I was in Santiago Chile which is a beautiful city

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,960
There are parts that actually reminded me of Beverly Hills

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
Glass

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,752
Towers

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,776
Palm trees

7
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,312
Ton of shopping

8
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,592
Oh I know I'm from

9
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,360
Cantina MD

10
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
Shopping malls

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,664
Concealed AR

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,432
Legend

13
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,016
So I was driving around Santiago with carola Fuentes

14
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,880
She's a journalist and a filmmaker who's done some amazing reporting on Chile's economy

15
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
Now we are arriving to the park at I'll go with you

16
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,280
Very very big mall

17
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,608
And we are going to the McDonald's

18
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:41,984
So you went to a foreign country and you went straight to McDonald's

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
Is pathetic

20
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:48,384
But I wanted to test out something that I had heard about Chile that I found really hard to believe

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,664
What I've heard about

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
McDonald's in Chile

23
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:55,040
Is it we can buy food here and then we can

24
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
Pay for it in installments

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
Right

26
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
You can paint

27
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,928
Installments no interest

28
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:07,328
Or you can pay nine stohlman with interest I could buy a hamburger and pay for it in 9 installments

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Right

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,984
So we pull up to the window to order

31
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,504
In my credit card did not work so we use Kerala

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,064
I will be paying for dysentery for 9 months

33
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
I paid her back

34
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,208
But this is the reason I was in Chile

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
It has some

36
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
Pork

37
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,096
They're just really interesting to an economics reporter

38
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
I mean come on

39
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,680
The financial aized the hamburger

40
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
It's like this

41
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,544
Wonderland of free market capitalism

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
Orig developed country

43
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:56,224
That is the Envy of its neighbors like Argentina and Venezuela

44
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
All this

45
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,136
Came out of real car

46
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
And that story

47
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
Is one of the

48
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,792
Strangest and most dramatic stories in economic history

49
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,888
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Noel King and I'm Jasmine cars

50
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
Today on the show we go to Chile

51
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
A country that was one of the Battleground

52
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,080
Of the Cold War the war between Marxism and capitalism

53
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,640
Between dictatorship and freedom

54
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,736
Any chili they were Economist on the front lines of this war

55
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,552
Most of them and trained at the University of Chicago

56
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
They called them

57
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
The Chicago boys

58
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,976

69
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
Jasmine you were the person who first told me about the Chicago boys to be honest I was a little surprised you've never heard of them these guys

70
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,400
Is there a super famous in economically circles in South America

71
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
So I started reading about them in right away I thought

72
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,056
This might be the craziest story about it

73
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,336
Economist that I've ever heard

74
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
And I thought

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
I have got to meet these guys

76
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,736
So I spent a couple of months calling around

77
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,552
The Chicago boys are old now they're in their eighties

78
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
And most of them didn't want to talk to

79
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
They have their reasons

80
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,696
But then finally one of them said

81
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Okay

82
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,304
Intervista elevator

83
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
Very nice building okay

84
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
And that is how I ended up

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
In Santiago

86
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
301

87
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,408
Oh my goodness hello

88
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,480
Your elevator opens on to your apartment that's

89
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
Very nice

90
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
Hit you

91
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
I'm so sorry

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
These are not my clothes

93
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
The airline lost my bag is the worst

94
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,696
Anyway why didn't

95
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,024
Go ahead and tell me your name and tell me what you do

96
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,095
Best my name is Rolf losers

97
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,191
And I am a professor of Economics at the castle Universal

98
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
So

99
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
You are

100
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Your Chicago boy

101
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,895
I haven't Chicago boys

102
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Yes

103
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
Here's a story of how he came to be a Chicago boy

104
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,295
In 1958 he's 22 years old

105
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
Annie's just graduated from college

106
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,743
And he gets this really exciting invitation to study at the University of Chicago in the United States

107
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,607
Chicago has this scholarship program going it's funded by the US government

108
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Beers at work

109
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,775
Looters gets flown up to Chicago to the University of Chicago he gets to get an advanced degree in economics or busy

110
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
For free

111
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,663
In return he has to come back to Teala and teach what is learn to college kids

112
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:12,319
Looters is from an upper-middle-class household his dad owns an electronics store like Best Buy

113
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
He's never been out of chili

114
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
So when he's offered a place

115
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
Chicago kicks

116
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,767
She gets on a plane with four other young smart Chilean guys

117
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
The Landing Miami they rent a car they take a road trip

118
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,423
And they are marveling at how developed the United States is

119
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Tremendous

120
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
List of buildings

121
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
The store

122
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
A different world

123
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
This plants a seed in luders head

124
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,431
He sees that the United States has a lot of material wealth

125
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
And also a lot of free

126
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,807
They get to Chicago and they're giving about $90 a month

127
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
And they're told

128
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Listen

129
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,391
This isn't Thailand

130
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
University this is going to be really intense

131
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
He said he took off

132
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
Saturday

133
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
But what about the weather

134
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,631
Bethel Sundays we would be back

135
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
At the library

136
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Study which

137
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
For me initially was

138
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,103
Absolutely crazy but later on you get accustomed to it and saw a monks

139
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Yes

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,223
Yes Sorel fluters is deep in his studies at Chicago

141
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
And while he's there

142
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,831
He meets a man who's going to change his life

143
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
And the future of his country of Chile

144
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Milton Friedman

145
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
Looters remembers him as

146
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
Brilliant

147
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
Articulate

148
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
Physically

149
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Very very small

150
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:33,215
1 meter 60 or something like that he was also very busy

151
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,311
Friedman was on his way to becoming really well known for his worldview

152
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,639
This firm belief that economic freedom

153
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,223
And personal and political Freedom go together

154
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,063
Free markets Friedman thought lead to political freedom

155
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
So bottom line

156
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,159
The government should stay out of the economy

157
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
So he argued that even like

158
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,791
Public schools are sign of government being too big

159
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,607
National parks should be run by private come

160
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,191
The operation of a

161
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
Even more

162
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,295
Naruto says he's relationship with Friedman was not about ideology

163
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
Lucas is interested in inflation

164
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
So is freedom

165
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
They hit it off

166
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,975
And looters ask Friedman to be his thesis advisor

167
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
Friedman says okay

168
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,119
Saludos writes his thesis a monetary history of Chile

169
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
And he turns it in

170
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
He waits a while

171
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
Then while longer

172
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:43,615
And finally he asks Friedman have you read past the first chapter

173
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Economist

174
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Those who ride

175
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
And those who read

176
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,551
And I'm one of those right so he hadn't read the rest of this

177
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,623
Thesis advisor and you haven't registered

178
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Well

179
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
Did that's the way he was

180
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
Luda gets a degree

181
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
And he makes good on the pledge

182
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
In 1960 he goes back to too late.

183
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,191
And it's not just real food or so at this point there's now a whole group of Chilean men who studied it Chicago

184
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
And then come back to chili to teach

185
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,031
All of this economic knowledge

186
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,127
I just looters aside from all the technical stuff you were learning

187
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,967
What was like the big idea that you took away from Chicago

188
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
The system

189
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,551
Does make a big difference

190
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
In the well-being of the people

191
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
Very important

192
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
Do have the right sister

193
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,303
When he gets back too late is an upheaval his country is fighting

194
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
Over this precise thing

195
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,167
What kind of economic system are they going to have

196
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Here's what's happening

197
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,031
Chile is run by a tiny Elite group of people

198
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
If you're poor you're going to stay poor there's no such thing as upward Mobility

199
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
People are fighting just to eat

200
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,479
But here's the thing she late is a democracy

201
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,527
If people are fed up they're going to vote

202
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
To change this

203
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,319
And that's what they do

204
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,903
Two in the mid-60s the government is respond

205
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:05,791
The first thing they do is a policy that is now known as agrarian reform

206
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
The government will go to wealthy landowners and say

207
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,167
We're going to buy your land for a low price

208
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,519
We're going to put it into a cooperative and then we're going to redistributed among the poor

209
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
This expropriation

210
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
Causes very deep divide

211
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,015
One Gabrielle Valdez wrote an important book about the Chicago boys and about with chili was like back then

212
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,807
Lisa Grant reform

213
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
Could you study normous division in society

214
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Because you had

215
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,207
The extraordinary cases in which

216
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,023
The Sun for instance working for the government

217
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,607
How to decide the expropriation of the land of his

218
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
Pirates

219
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
And this happened in fact

220
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,543
This happened in fact that a man would go knock on his father's door and say hey Pop

221
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
We're giving the land to

222
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:54,175
To The Peasants exactly like that because that would be in a movie

223
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:59,551
It was one of those situations where everybody knew someone or knew someone who knew someone

224
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,903
Roth looters had a friend from the University of Chicago a fellow Chicago boy

225
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,303
This guy's dad dropped dead of a heart attack when the government came to take his land

226
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,607
This is a very heavy time

227
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,727
The fight over land reform is pushing people further to the left and the right

228
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
And this environment provides an opening

229
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
For a leftist politician

230
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
Salvador Allende

231
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
Celebrity is a complicated

232
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,295
To the Marxist who also love the good life

233
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Wine

234
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
Nice clothes

235
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
Ian day is also a

236
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,231
Appalled at the conditions at Port Orleans are living in

237
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,071
And he's been running for president for like the last 18 years

238
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
Talking about his socialist vision for chili

239
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
And keeps losing

240
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
Politician he's got an issue

241
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
The copper in

242
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,335
Chili's got tons of valuable copper

243
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
Videos on shooting sticks in the mind

244
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,967
The profits are mostly going to American

245
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
And she says

246
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
That isn't right

247
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
If I'm elected

248
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
I will make those profit

249
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
It's go back to Thalia

250
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,439
And it resonates people get riled up

251
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,791
A&A even gets his own bard of folk singer named Victor Jara

252
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
Who's this handsome guy

253
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,911
From a poor peasant family who writes these beautiful Tunes

254
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,263
My guitar is not for the rich no nothing like that

255
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,383
My song is a bladder that we're building to reach the Stars

256
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
He's like Chili's Bob Dylan

257
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
Wake up Woody Guthrie

258
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,319
All of this is going down during the Cold War

259
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,415
In the United States Marxism is seen as the most

260
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
Sinister force in the world

261
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Capitalism

262
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:46,815
Is what we liked capitalism is the thing that keeps us free

263
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,863
To President Richard Nixon

264
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,887
Heats communist

Tells the CIA

266
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,239

00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Do more of it

268
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
NES classic

269
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
CIA

270
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:02,175
Agendas running for president in the CIA funnels money to his opponents

271
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,479
Pace for a massive propaganda

272
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,527
Leaflets pamphlets

273
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
Radio shows

274
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,415
What are the big moves it's fear-mongering they compare I ended to Fidel Castro

275
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
And Castro

276
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,023
And the Cuban Revolution really are on everyone's mind

277
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:22,143
Ralph Lueders the Chicago Boys still in Academia in Santiago he's a d now

00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:27,263
And he is starting to worry that chili is on the verge of a revolution like you

279
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,103
Then one day with the big presidential election coming up

280
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,663
One of his grad students comes to him and says

281
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943

Did he say what would happen to you if you didn't

293
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
No he didn't

294
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423

Cedar Street

There's confusion there are strikes output plummets

329
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,215
And he also makes good on his promise to help

The poor he gives free milk to all young till and kids

Chile's economy shutters

This whole time

And the hoard food and that leads to even more shortages

383
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,663

Bye bye bye

It's nothing in the pot

410
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
Because there was nothing to put in the box

411
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Did she bring the pain

412
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503

A few months later things got worse

415
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
In October of 72

416
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
Truckers organize strikes

417
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,975

We now know that the CIA was paying people to support that strike it's huge

419
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
Everything in Chile moves on land

420

Capital One

468
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559

475
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,831
One afternoon Ralph looters and I caught in a taxi and we drove to Providencia which is this ritual neighborhood

476
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
Draped in trees

477
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,135
Satanism

478
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Because it would

479
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Yeah

480
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,375
We waited outside of a pretty white brick house and he pointed to a window up on the set

481
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
That's weather

482
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,191
That's weather brick Westwood

483
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
The Brick

484
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
With the Economy Inn

485
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
Free fall

486
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:33,919
Some of the Chicago boys some of this small group of Economist who know each other from the University of Chicago

487
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,479
They start meeting in a room in this house

488
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,599
They sit around a table and they hash out an economic plan for their collapsing country

489
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,927
They're like doctors writing a prescription for a sick patient

490
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:48,255
Drink more water eat more fiber

491
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,327
Unfix the prices Stop Printing money

492
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
Cut tariffs

493
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,167
Let inefficient Industries die

494
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,727
The manuscript get so big

495
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,775
Someone starts calling it a lottery

496
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
The Brick

497
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
The idea is

498
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,639
They're going to offer it to whatever government comes next

499
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
They would offer the program

500
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,479
Do any government who succeeded

501
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
I didn't

502
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
While we're sitting outside of that White House

503
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
Reuters tells me

504
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,135
The Economist were up in one room

505
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:20,000
But in another room there are the offices of a magazine that has links

506
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
To a conservative newspaper called el Mercurio

507
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,632
The CIA is pain that newspaper

508
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,168
The turnout

509
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,984
Orioles about how I ended is making a mess

510
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Out of the car

511
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,800
So of course you wonder

512
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,616
Did the CIA pay for the bridge

513
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,688
30 is old Declassified CIA files

514
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
From the time

515
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,552
Dimension collaborators working on an economic plan

516
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
But they don't

517
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
Name any name

518
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
So we might never know

519
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,000
Let's said the world of Chicago educated economist

520
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,280
And spies

521
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,608
And journalists being paid by spies It's a Small World

522
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:02,240
Someone in Chile's military knows that these guys are working on a plan to fix the economy

523
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
Router says when the military hears that

524
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
They decide it's time to move

525
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,968
The military probably would have not taking over government

526
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
If they didn't have it program

527
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:18,112
Had the military seen the brick in advance

528
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
Did hurt

529
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
Yes

530
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,256
Oh my God relationship between

531
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
The Brick

532
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,840
And the military coup in the sense that

533
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,400
The military coup would not have taken place

534
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
The daily

535
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
At that time

536
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,032
If it wouldn't have been for

537
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
But for the breaker

538
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:43,200
On September 11th 1973 Chile military launches

539
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:49,856
And one of these men who slides in between the world of military and propaganda

540
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:50,880
Takes the brick

541
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
Fires up a mimeograph machine

542
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,232
And starts cranking out copies

543
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
By the next day

544
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:03,168
The military will have the brick in their hands

545
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,712
On the next episode The Chicago boys get their shot at fixing She lays economy

546
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:20,320
Is a coup a capitalist Revolution end the end for a Time

547
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
Of democracy in Chile

548
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
That's next time on Planet Money

549
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
