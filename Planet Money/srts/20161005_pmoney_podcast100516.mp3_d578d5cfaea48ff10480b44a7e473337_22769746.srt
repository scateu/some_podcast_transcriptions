00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,096
Hey guys it's Noelle here today's episode is a rerun

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:07,424
It was originally reported by Hannah joffe-walt back in 2004

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,192
14

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,496
And we have an update for you at the end

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:11,776
Okay here goes

6
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,848
Betty and George are planners

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,128
Betty especially

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,968
Years ago that he looked around and identified George Phillips

9
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,272
As someone she would probably marry in the future

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,112
You're the truck mechanic same background sense of humor

11
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,648
Somebody made a plan

12
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,720
And 4 years later George Phillips quite happily

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,744
Peking Betty's husband

14
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,584
George and Betty plan to shovel the snow on Saturday

15
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,144
The call Betty's brother on Tuesday after

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,912
46 Bubba

17
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,680
Before 8

18
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,592
To finish the 1000 piece puzzle on the card table immediately after Betty has finished organizing the pieces into tile

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,616
Bicolor

20
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
And Daddy has a plan

21
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
Bird f

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,504
Oh I have been answered long time ago

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
Maven

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,112
Fred Meyer funeral arrangements

25
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,440
It's all written up in some paperwork filed in her home

26
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,464
With duplicates at the

27
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
The papers

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,048
Called an advance directive

29
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,864
Spell out exactly how Betty would like to die

30
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,936
No machines no feeding tubes no CPR

31
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,472
I want you like to have happen after

32
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
But he's not sick

33
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,568
She just wants everyone to know what you'd like to have happen

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
George has one too

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
Oh yes

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,992
Fix one up in 2004

37
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,832
So very good idea where do I be kept alive just to

38
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Be a vegetable

39
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,952
She feels about like I do neither one of us

40
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
Chemotherapy

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
If you guys have cancer why are you talking back to me

42
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
But

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
Like I said

44
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Planners

45
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
Betty and George live in Lacrosse

46
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
Wisconsin the town of 50000 people on the misses

47
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
Mississippi River

48
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
Right next to Iowa and Minnesota

49
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,016
And there's a lot in common with other towns that size in America except for one thing

50
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,600
A lot of people in this town have planned for their death

51
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,696
They've written down instructions of what they do and don't want to have happen

52
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
At the end of their lives

53
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,072
This is not just planners like Betty and George not just people in their 80s

54
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
96

55
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,400
Percent of the people who died in the cross

56
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
Have planned for their death

57
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
That is an astounding number

58
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,896
Across the country about 30% of adults have done some sort of end of life

59
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
Planning

60
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
And even if you look at severely ill people

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
It's only about half

62
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,552
96% here

63
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:37,952
Which means you can go to any random black and his town and stand a pretty good chance of talking to someone who has considered how

64
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
Oh here she would like to die

65
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,560
Like just across the street from Betty's house

66
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
Alan Jean

67
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
They made plans for the end of their lives

68
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Years ago

69
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,984
Next door Sandra Legrand tells me she and her husband

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
Made most of the medical decisions

71
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,848
But they've been going back and forth lately about the burial

72
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
He wanted to have his body in

73
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
Underground

74
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,504
And then he said well maybe I want to be

75
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,552
So we both were thinking of

76
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Cremation

77
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
Inside

78
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,208
And then we both decided maybe we'll just be buried

79
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
In the ground

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
In the urn

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
You know after being

82
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
After they left it when they filled out the paperwork

83
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
Cassandra says Cheerilee

84
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,800
This kind of plans are common enough that it's when someone does not do it

85
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
That's when you notice

86
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,664
In the course of our conversation Sandra mentions the Eric's

87
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,248
Other people about mentioned the Erikson's to me too

88
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,064
The Erikson's has not filled out their advance.

89
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
Sandra Legrand told me

90
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
She's an animal that is

91
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,536
Kathryn Erickson was putting away her yoga mat when I showed up on her doorstep

92
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,120
She and her husband Randy were chatting with her daughter about her homework

93
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
And a

94
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:55,520
Awkwardly mentioned that they have a rap on the Block for neglecting to make end-of-life plans

95
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,896
They both laughed and said oh yeah. Legrand's have been nagging us about that for a while

96
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
But we're having dinner with the Legrand

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,968
Is tomorrow and maybe we

98
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Definitely ask

99
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
Forget about it

100
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,976
They're sparkly eyed teenager Annie sez

101
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
It's okay we talked about all that stuff

102
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
Before I know what to do

103
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,863
I know for sure if my mom is ever stuck in a coma

104
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,447
And there's no hope for her that she supposed to pull the plug in

105
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
Tattoo

106
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
Is she right

107
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
Yes

108
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,407
I feel like the teenager talking to Annie and actually everyone in Lacrosse

109
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,991
Asking strangers questions about death makes me uncomfortable

110
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,599
Because I'm from the America were talking about death is like talking about sex

111
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
You don't do it

112
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
At least

113
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,231
Not a lot and definitely not on some random Wednesday evening with

114
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Your parents

115
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,351
Annie happens to me from this one tiny pocket of America

116
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
It just does death differently

117
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,471
This conversation by the way in the Erikson household

118
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
It just kept going everyone in this house

119
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,359
Is perfectly healthy but they seem to kind of get into talking about this

120
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,687
Annie starts detailing her plans for her dad's

121
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Funeral

122
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,391
For my dad I do have a song in mind already

123
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,207
Bruce Springsteen

124
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
Terry song

125
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
Why have you thought

126
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
Which one out for your dad

127
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
It's a good

128
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
It's a good funeral song

129
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,799
The funny thing is it's like a hidden

130
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Amtrak

131
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,927
What happened you at seventeen

132
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
Your dad's

133
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,767
The song that you sing at your dad's funeral

134
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
Actually sure how it's

135
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
Become such a come from

136
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:01,471
How indeed did this become such a comfortable conversation in Lacrosse

137
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Wisconsin

138
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm kinda joffe-walt

139
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:11,455
Ann on Today Show we are going to answer that question with the story of the one place in America

140
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,503
That is at ease with mortality

141
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,831

153
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:05,215
Lacrosse Wisconsin used to be like everywhere in America awkward and fearful about death

154
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:10,079
Couples did not go back and forth about cremation versus Burial at the dinner table like

155
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
Like they were talking about which movie to see

156
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,687
Neighbors didn't gossip about the one family on the Block

157
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,991
But had not planned for its demise

158
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,319
The people of a cross discuss death right now

159
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,159
Because one guy decided the town needed to be talking about it

160
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,951
Because if they were not talking about it

161
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
He was the one who ended up having to do it

162
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,327
Have these awkward painful conversations with everyone

163
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:36,447
This guy's name is Bud Hammes he works at the local hospital as a medical ethics

164
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,567
Which basically means Bud was the guy who would get called when someone's dad had a

165
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,127
Stroke and was being kept alive on machines

166
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Side with the down with

167
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
The family end

168
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,735
Try to help them figure out what to do next

169
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,527
Every time

170
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,319
The discussion was

171
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
Excruciate

172
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,183
Well you could see it on you know on Face the English like

173
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Tried it mean you could just

174
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:04,351
And in the comments that they would made you know how what do you think Mom would want I don't know I got to

175
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
Did Dad ever say anything to you

176
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,495
Don't know what to do here and that's why I was called in to help

177
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
These families at least sort this out asbestos

178
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Weekend

179
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
The moral

180
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,431
Distress that these families were suffering

181
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Was

182
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Palpable you could feel it in the room

183
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
End

184
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
That no matter what they decided

185
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
They would never

186
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Have any clarity

187
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,231
About whether they made the right decision

188
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,327
The thing that was especially maddening to bite about these conversations

189
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,887
Was that they were entirely predictable

190
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,543
Most of the time the conversation would be about a patient who had been sick for years we've been coming to the hospital

191
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,823
Over and over again

192
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
Sometimes multiple times

193
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
I found it distressing

194
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
That

195
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:54,783
We were taking care of patients and not giving them any opportunity

196
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,343
To have a voice in their care

197
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
Should they become incapacitated

198
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Take the dialysis

199
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
The center at Gundersen health

200
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,999
Square Bud work

201
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
What's the hospital

202
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
There are 60 people in the dialysis

203
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:13,471
Center only two of the 60 had living wills or advance directives that specify if they were

204
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
To be kept alive on machines

205
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
And for the people in the dialysis center

206
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,383
This was likely to be a real question

207
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
Potentially in the near future

208
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,991
So that's our bed started in the dialysis center

209
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
You started with the nurses

210
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,391
He gave them all training on how to ask every person to complete an advance directive

211
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,719
How to sit with patients and go through questions like

212
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,791
If I have a stroke do I want to go on a ventilator or not

213
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,607
If I can't do this or that do I want to stay on Dallas

214
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
So the nurses all got trains

215
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,447
And then

216
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
The months went by

217
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,799
Not a single nurse asked a single patient

218
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
It was just too

219
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Scary

220
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
So

221
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,943
Badass one Brave nurse to be the first

222
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:00,831
To be the model for all the other nurses and show everybody this was not going to be a big deal the patient would be open to it

223
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
And watched what happened

224
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
So the nurse assigned to this responsibility

225
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Approached

226
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Patient

227
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
And

228
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
How the patient started to cry

229
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
And her response was

230
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,239
I don't think I'm ready to have this conversation

231
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Versation

232
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
So the nurse did the right thing and said well

233
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
That's fine

234
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,455
If you change your mind let us know and then we can have the conversation

235
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,527
It didn't seem like a success at that moment

236
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,367
But eventually the patient did come back to the nurse and said she was ready

237
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
Other nurses started to be ready

238
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
YouTube they started asking patients

239
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,071
And actually the other Hospital in the cross asked Bud to come and work with the nurse

240
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Is there

241
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
To train people how to talk about end-of-life

242
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
Care

243
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:52,031
Verona lachman a nurse in the general surgery unit at Gundersen hospital where Bud works

244
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
She told me she had to practice saying the words to herself over and over again

245
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
Before she could finally approach a real life

246
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Patient

247
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
And then she did

248
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
In one of the surgeons came up afterwards and said

249
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,927
I don't want you talkin talkin about Advance care planning with my patients before they have surgery

250
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:16,351
It's like they're going to die and I don't want them thinking it was nothing like that but a lot of people struggle with that

251
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
That of course is the whole point

252
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
It's difficult to talk about

253
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
So the more you talk about it the more

254
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,079
Routine the question is the more comfortable it is to be asked

255
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,919
Macross you were asked again and again and again

256
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,015
You're going to have surgery and what you have done

257
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
Hysterectomy

258
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
What we have here to in who's your doctor

259
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
I'm Steven

260
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
Debbie Thurston is in her 30s

261
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,743
With red hair a red face red sweatshirt

262
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
She's not sick but she will be asked

263
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,375
If she wants to fill out an advance directive here during her pre-op

264
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,959
So have you ever done anything like a a living will

265
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
No I haven't

266
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,543
Debbie said she's not interested right now

267
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Tomorrow if she becomes interested

268
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,431
So have another opportunity shall be asked again when she comes in for her surgery

269
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,807
CC tells me the last time she had a procedure at the hospital someone left the paperwork by her bedside

270
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:12,671
Every every time I come to the hospital life and they asked me

271
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
I just haven't done it

272
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
And what do you think when they ask you about it every time

273
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,119
That's a good thing I just don't

274
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,703
I like to think I'm young and I'm not going to need it

275
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,775
Even though Debbie is saying no right now

276
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,359
She will almost certainly fill out the paperwork before she dies

277
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:36,991
Which hopefully will be many years from now but if you think about it 96% of the people who died here have one

278
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,319
Imagine how many more times Debbie will be at

279
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
All that nagging eventually leads to follow through

280
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
In Lacrosse

281
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,535
Even if it takes you until you were actually confronting a life-ending illness

282
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,071
To take a look at these questions

283
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
It won't be the first time you're considering them it won't be the first time you're thinking about all the choices you have to make about the way you want

284
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
Make yourself at home

285
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Okay

286
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,335
Beautiful morning isn't it

287
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,151
Cool out there though I bet you

288
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,783
Glenn muhlenkamp is a cheery 81 year old farmer sitting on his favorite recliner at home

289
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
Annies dying

290
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,623
Glen's prostate cancer has spread to his bones

291
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Season hospice

292
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,743
A nurse from the hospital Laura Weidman is here to help him fill out

293
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Is advance directive

294
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
Glenn's wife Jenny is

295
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:28,447
Flitting about showing Laura the nurse pictures of every one of her 27 grandkids

296
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
And Laura

297
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,055
The nurse masterfully guides Jenny to a chair next

298
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
The Glen to have a conversation

299
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,663
Jenny clearly does not want to have

300
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
You know when people have

301
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
A chronic illness

302
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
Like you have

303
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
Sometimes complication

304
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
This can occur

305
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
There could be a point where

306
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
You might not be able to

307
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
Speak for yourself

308
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,279
Jenny Glenn's wife is

309
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,351
Sitting on the edge of a chair rocking back and forth

310
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:01,215
Her head is turned sideways away from Glen and Laura her eyes are locked on a window

311
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,799
And Laura the nurse is mostly talking to Glenn

312
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,591
But it's fine designs that his wife

313
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Is here too

314
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:12,479
It's impossible for her to cover all the scenarios under which gland may die so the more specific

315
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
She can get from Glen

316
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,319
Hurt his wife Jenny to hear him say

317
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
You better

318
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,695
So Laura the nurse start sticking through some options listed on a stack of

319
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Shethority

320
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,255
Okay

321
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:29,631
If your cancer spreads and you reach a point where the treatments will extend your life by a few months

322
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
And the side effects are pretty serious

323
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,263
Would you want them to continue to do all of that or would you say

324
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
No

325
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Stop

326
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,479
If you had a serious complication from your kin

327
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Cancer

328
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
But you'd probably live through the complication

329
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,135
You would probably not walk again

330
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
Or you might not

331
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,183
Be able to

332
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Talk again

333
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
What would you choose them to do

334
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,095
Continue to do everything they possibly can for you

335
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,887
Or would you say no stop

336
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Stop

337
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,751
Glenn's wife Jenny's eyes are still locked on the window

338
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,775
She still rocking

339
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
But she has started silently

340
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Weeping

341
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
Laura the nurse puts

342
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
A hand on Jenny's me but forges ahead

343
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,991
Okay Sam's in area she says

344
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Survive

345
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
But you never know who you are

346
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,391
Would you want them to continue to do everything for you or would you want to

347
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
Stop stop

348
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,719
Cuz I've seen that for

349
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,511
They're just there

350
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
And that's not for you

351
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,935
Jenny Glenn's wife actually gets up and walks away at this

352
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,519
Glenn doesn't stop her and neither does the nurse Laura

353
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,127
Have you had enough of this conversation

354
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,431
I just had to get up and see what was

355
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Danny looks around

356
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
Aimlessly surveying the house

357
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
And then she mumbles

358
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
It's a big house

359
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,791
Any other room the nurse and Glen finish up the plan for the rest

360
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Glenn's life

361
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,095
No machines

362
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,119
No feeding tube

363
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,399
No ventilator

364
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
No CPR

365
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Stop

366
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
Stop

367
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Stop stop

368
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,615
There are few places where you find this kind of conversation happening regularly

369
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:20,735
And the conversations actually help explain this other Salient fact about lacrosse

370
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,807
Something I haven't mentioned yet it is a very unusual

371
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,927
La Crosse Wisconsin spends Less on Healthcare than any other place in the country

372
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,255
That comes from a group of researchers at Dartmouth College

373
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,583
B study the huge variation in healthcare spending

374
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
Between what Miami stands for

375
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
Grand Junction Colorado

376
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
Miami's at the top

377
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,031
La Crosse Wisconsin is at the very bottom of the list

378
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
Of the 306 region

379
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Send the Dartmouth theater

380
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,431
Lacrosse spends Less on each person on Medicare

381
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
Than anywhere else in America

382
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,831
That's not only because of these conversations about death but it's a big part of why

383
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,671
One-quarter of healthcare spending is on the last year of life

384
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
And planning for death

385
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
Thieves money

386
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:09,631
Because most people are like Glenn when asked ahead of time about their dying days and how they want things to go down these days

387
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
Stop stop stop stop

388
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,799
Here's Jeff Thompson the CEO of Gundersen Health System the hospital where but hammett's were

389
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
It turns out

390
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,151
That if you allow page

391
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,967
To choose and direct their care

392
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,039
And that you share that information with their families

393
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
10

394
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Then

395
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Waffen

396
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
They choose

397
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
Of course

398
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
But is much less expensive

399
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
And if people just had to guess

400
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
But humans and Jeff Thompson are panic

401
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,911
That I am going to make it sound like this is why lacrosse has

402
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
Advance Care Program

403
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,751
So let me clearly say here

404
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
It is not

405
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,079
In fact if you're Jeff

406
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
Running a hospital

407
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687
It doesn't make any sense hospitals get paid for doing things

408
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,503
There's a billing code for a hysterectomy

409
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
For a hip replaced

410
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,807
There's a billing code for asp

411
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,647
There's no billing code for Advance care planning

412
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
How do you

413
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,719
Pay for that program

414
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,487
Here

415
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,095
Well I really can't answer that because that

416
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
That is not a

417
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:19,519
A good death sign of a CEO because of course we lose money on this program

418
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,591
This program makes no economic sense

419
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
4

420
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,151
Anyone taking care of

421
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,735
Medicare patients on a fee-for-service basis

422
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
So Jeff Camp Hill for it

423
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
It does save money to do this kind of planning

424
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
But it saves

425
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Medicare

426
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
Money it saves insurance companies money not

427
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Jeff

428
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,815
One-quarter of healthcare spending is on the last year of life

429
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
That's pending that goes to hospital

430
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Doctors

431
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,495
For us we spend money on a program

432
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,567
That ultimately will decrease our Revenue stream

433
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
It robs you of money later

434
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,711
Right right but but it's clearly the right thing to do

435
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,295
That is a lot of money though that you're leaving on the table

436
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
You're right

437
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
Jeff says they do it because it's

438
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
It's the right thing to do

439
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
And frankly he tells me

440
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:16,863
I wasn't here at Gunderson when they started doing Advanced Care planning but if I tried to take it away now he says

441
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,655
The community would revolt

442
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
This is just how we do things

443
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:27,103
So you can see why most Hospital CEOs may find a program that have to run for free that would almost assure

444
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,151
Assuredly reduce one of the hospitals

445
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Largest revenue streams

446
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,503
You can see why they might find that unattractive

447
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:38,879
But still there must be someone in Washington who would try to push through an idea that is

448
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,951
Relatively simple to implement and proven to save money

449
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Right

450
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,559
This is the thing Tom Grissom president after president has tried to

451
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,607
To do reduce Healthcare spending

452
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,679
You think they're beat someone who would want to make this happen right

453
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
Wow

454
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
There was

455
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,287
You may remember in 2009 the phrase

456
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
Descant

457
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
What was in the news

458
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,735
That year Gundersen La Crosse Hospital helped write something for the house Reform Bill that would pay people

459
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,527
For doing Advance care planning with Kay

460
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
And this is what happened

461
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
Bureaucrat

462
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:16,255
Rash and care if the bill goes through as Obama wants it to go through

463
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,863
Sarah Palin warns that the government was going to start rationing care and was going to decide

464
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
Who could get care and who could not

465
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,239
It was Wildfire or seniors going to be in front of the death battle

466
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,055
Pulling the plug on grandma or denying her care

467
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:34,431
Sarah Palin has a rock them with that one because she's dead right they are death panels

468
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:41,087
It's weird the fact that end-of-life planning could save money you think that would have popularized the approaching a country

469
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,719
6 of the economy is Health Care spending but in 2009 it was actually probably why it did not

470
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
Become more widespread

471
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
It was a bug

472
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Not a feature

473
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,631
Health Care reform passed without the death panels

474
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,911
That we're not really death panels

475
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
DuckTales actually means

476
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:02,079
But the lot did include Financial rewards for hospitals and physician practices

477
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,151
That could figure out how to reduce spending on their own

478
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,503
So a lot of them are naturally turning to Lacrosse

479
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Trying to figure out what they're doing

480
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,647
And they're reaching out to but him is to ask him how do we get people to plan for death

481
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,464
You can hardly handle the calls coming in

482
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,328
They told me when he first started this in the cross in the 1990s in the dialysis center

483
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
You better to take

484
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,728
A year maybe to get it set up and started in the region and then maybe a few more years for it.

485
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
Spread throughout the country

486
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:37,152
20 years later but is putting off retirement because he's pretty sure this is the moment

487
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,944
This is when it's finally going to have

488
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:49,696
It's Noel here again to big things in the story have stayed the same and one has changed

489
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:56,352
Is Hannah said about a quarter of all Medicare spending happens in the last year of a person's life that figure hasn't budged

490
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:00,448
And neither has but he is still not retired yet

491
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,264
Does this sub this change roll

492
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,824
Give me working at least for a few more years

493
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,176
When I'm able to make this transition from one home to another as it were

494
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
And we have in place the next group of leaders

495
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
I'll be happy

496
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
To step down

497
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,832
The transition he's talking about

498
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,368
That is the big change

499
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:23,488
The end-of-life planning program looks like it may have finally expanded Beyond lacrosse

500
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
The program is going to

501
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,632
Move to a National Coalition call the coalition

502
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,192
To transform Advanced Care

503
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:37,312
And so we think this is going to be a better home for us because it will

504
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,640
Really tired send to a national platform

505
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:47,296
But says he's even spreading worldwide the EU is funding a study called the action trial that'll test a version

506
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,088
Canada lacrosse program in six

507
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
Countries

508
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,648
