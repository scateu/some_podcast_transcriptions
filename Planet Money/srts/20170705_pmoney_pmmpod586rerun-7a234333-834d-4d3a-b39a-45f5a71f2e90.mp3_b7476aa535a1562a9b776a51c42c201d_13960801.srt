Paint just a quick note Today Show is a rerun it originally ran in 2014

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,832
A while back I got this

11
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,368
Big flat screen TV

12
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,160
TV for my bedroom

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
A better date

14
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:29,952
I took it out the box

15
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,488
Set up over there in the corner

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024
You want doesn't come with

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048
It doesn't come with the

18
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,840
Cables you need to connect it

19
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,864
All your other stuff

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
So I go to Best Buy

21
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
Snooty Viennese like

22
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,472
I'm you're going to need an H

23
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,240
HDMI

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
And bad news

25
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,592
The 45

26
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,640
$45

27
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,432
For some wires and plastic

28
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
And I pay

29
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,760
I pasted because otherwise

30
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
My TV was just a big

31
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,576
Thousand-dollar black

32
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
Robert today you can go online and buy that exact cable that you paid whatever 45 bucks for today UK

33
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,024
You can buy it for

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,584
$3.61

35
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
I should have waited

36
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
No we take it for granted the things

37
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,240
Get cheaper that there is,

38
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Petition

39
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,336
Technological items of technological advancement

40
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
How does this exactly happened how does something that used to cost $45 that I was willing to pay $45 for

41
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,272
How does that now cost

42
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
3 or 4.

43
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
There's this one particular company

44
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
That got famous for selling cheap

45
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
HDMI

46
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
The company is called Monoprice

47
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,304
When they emerged a few years ago they started out as sort of this

48
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,376
Cult secret among nerds who love buying cheap table

49
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,400
But pretty soon

50
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
What company started noticing as well

51
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
Bernard luthi used to work for one of those

52
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,336
And I remember I remember sitting in a room

53
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
With our CEO

54
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
And he asked us

55
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
He hurt his company Monoprice

56
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,784
And he said they're getting our shorts in in

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,112
Around the Cable business eating or shortening or shorts in the

58
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Michaela business

59
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,256
No

60
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
Luther was so impressed by Monoprice he went to work there

61
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
He's now the president of the company

62
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
The story of the HDMI cable

63
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
Monoprice does

64
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Over

65
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
And over again

66
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
Electric keyboards

67
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
Speakers and

68
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
Cameras electric guitars

69
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,128
Literally thousands of other things

70
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
And for all that gear

71
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
The basic idea is

72
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
Is the same

73
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Pick something

74
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528
Take some of that people love

75
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
Figure out how to sell it for

76
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,720
Lolking Planet Money I'm Robert Smith

Jacob Goldstein

78
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
Today on the show we figure out why some stuff gets cheaper

Consumer electronics

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,168
There's no law that says they have to get cheaper

82
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
And yet

83
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
Year after year decade after decade

84
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
Today we visit a company

85
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
What people make this happen

86
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:00,736

More information is available at aecf. Org

90
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,328
I went out to Monoprice a few weeks ago their headquarters is in this

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
Super generic Office Park

92
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
In the

93
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,728
Awesomely named Rancho Cucamonga California

94
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,312
At the base of the Foothills just outside of LA and they've got their office

95
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
Is there end this big Warehouse

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
4000 square feet in size

97
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:36,320
I feel like everybody is how many football fields something like that with you

98
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:40,416
I looked it up you could fit three football fields in the Monoprice Warehouse

99
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,464
At cables it turns out

100
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Still a big deal at model

101
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,608
Are some cables more cable thousand foot 500000 foot cable

102
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
The tables everywhere

103
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
What's the biggest seller

104
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
392

105
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,104
/ 6 / HDMI cable HDMI cable is product number 392

106
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
And it sounds like crazy you have like a trophy on your wall that says 3992 on it everybody knows that

107
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,528
Number

108
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
Everyone in this building knows that the ID number

109
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,672
Monoprice doesn't just buy cheap stuff

110
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
From other companies

111
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
Define little things in Market

112
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
China and then sell it retail

113
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
Bead designs

114
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,631
The tweet that they put the Monoprice name right on

115
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,215
I visited this room at the company's headquarters where a lot of this

116
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
It's called the Tesla

117
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,567
The first thing to say about the test lab is

118
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
It is not allowed

119
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
Picture more like rec room

120
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,967
Somebody who is super into Electronics

121
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
One side of the room is like

122
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Speaker lamp

123
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,927
This is my neck of the woods here this is this is my little audio Corner Albert Cardenas is mono prices

124
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Speaker Guy

125
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,231
What is what is that on the wall

126
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
Basically it's foam

127
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,375
Kind of looks like a padded cell

128
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
There's speaker parts

129
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Speaker boxes

130
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
Speaker wires

131
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,055
Albert starts taking apart a speaker to show me his work

132
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
And the grill remove

133
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,663
And you

134
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
Can you get a

135
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,527
Aluminum midrange

136
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,831
Add a 3/4 inch aluminum

137
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,391
Twitter the guys in this room are tinker

138
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:20,255
There's no Brand New Concept no one's coming up with inventions that no one has ever seen but

139
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
The format progress at Monoprice

140
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,119
Is take like a little piece of metal

141
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
And already existing speaker

142
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,959
Just make it a little bit fitter

143
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
So basically I redesign was called the face play

144
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
He says this made the sound

145
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,151
Clear gives me a little demonstration puts his hand in front of his mouth

146
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,967
So this would have been the before this would have been the actor

147
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
One more time this is the before

148
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
This is the actor

149
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,623
Another corner of the test lab belongs to a guy named

150
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Chris Apple

151
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,487
There's this big fancy monitor sitting on a desk in that corner of the room

152
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,255
Pro tip

153
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
If you want to sound like a Savvy Tech expert

154
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
Don't call a monitor monitor

155
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Call it a day

156
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
That's what Christmas

157
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,239
This is our newest 4K display

158
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311
Legalizing some of the fanciest thing on the market right now

159
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,127
I should turn on for you

160
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,943
Chris and Albert's job is to be on the hunt

161
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
At all

162
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,015
Looking for popular stuff that they can

163
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,807
Figure out how to sell at a discount

164
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,951
The popular stuff that Monoprice doesn't sell at all

165
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Because

166
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
They take a look at it

167
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
And it's already soaked

168
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,095
One really striking example of this is

169
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
Flat screen TV

170
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
If you walk into a store and buy a TV

171
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Almost any TV

172
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
You are probably paying

173
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,823
About what it cost to make that TV and get it

174
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,663
You're probably getting a good deal when you buy a flat screen TV

175
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
So

176
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
Monoprice does not sell flat

177
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
Because there's no way they could sell them at a disc

178
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
And make a profit

179
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,647
So what what happens at Monoprice is essentially detector

180
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Seeing an object

181
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
And saying

182
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Could we make money off of that

183
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
And this can take months or even years

184
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,703
And as it happens the story of this fancy monitor that Chris just turned on is actually a really good example of the

185
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
What kind of detective work these guys go through

186
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
You to figure this stuff out

187
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,335
But screw the monitor it starts about 4 years ago

188
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Walking through a Best Buy

189
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
He goes there sometimes to check out the competition

190
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
And also

191
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
He needed some random things that Monoprice didn't care

192
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,391
So I was walking by and the images of honey bees buzzing around on the screen cut my eye

193
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
Chris was way off to the side of them

194
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
He wasn't looking straight at

195
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
Maybe ten feet away

196
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,791
But even so he says

197
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
It blew his mind

198
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,375
It was better than any monitor here to Everest

199
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
I could see

200
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
The pollen on their abdomen and I could see every fluttering detail as the wings flap it was

201
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
Spectacular

202
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,199
And what did you think or feel when you thought

203
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
I got to have it

204
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
But unfortunately saw the price tag shortly thereafter

205
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,391
And their first introduction was over a thousand

206
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
The monitor was

207
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Me by app

208
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,023
A cinema display

209
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Cinema

210
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,607
Chris in his own words is up

211
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
PC fanboy

212
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,215
So what he really wants is a monitor like this when he's staring at him

213
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,031
But one that's cheaper and one that's made for a p

214
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,383
For Chris a monitor like this would be and I'm quoting him here

215
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,663
A white unit

216
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
It was something I dreamed it was not available on the market it was something I so wanted to give to

217
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
To my friends my customers of my customers myself

218
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
But had no way of getting it

219
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,023
That really was my my like mythical creature

220
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,607
Standing there staring at this thing in Best Buy

221
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Crystle Stewart

222
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
Why is this

223
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
So expensive

224
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
Why does it cost a thousand

225
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,335
Now it could just be the Apple brand people are willing to

226
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,383
To pay a lot of extra money for that logo

227
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,991
Or could be but only apple is able to manufacture this monitor

228
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:58,623
Perhaps they were the first ones to go to some Factory in Asia and say this is exactly what we want make this thing

229
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
In other words maybe it's expensive because

230
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
There's no competition

231
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,231
Chris Noth

232
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,535
He's not going to be able to get some other Factory

233
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
Free to start making enough

234
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
It's just too time-consuming and too expensive for Monoprice tube

235
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,983
But Chris also knows that when a hot new Gadget comes out

236
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
There's usually some guy

237
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,567
With the right connections at the factory

238
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,639
Who can get you the the online equivalent of a back alley

239
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
My is my thought process was here there's no way

240
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
No way in hell that they help

241
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,671
Apple was getting these exclusively made for just them and they weren't getting out

242
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
Coming up in a minute

243
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
Chris goes in search of his unit

244
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,863

Socrates that amazing monitor at Best Buy

253
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,207
And then he goes straight home and starts doing some Detective

254
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,743
First things first

255
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,047
I go to eBay attention the specs for the money

256
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,607
Search results come up and he sees that in fact

257
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:18,239
There are few people in Korea who are selling cheaper PC versions of these monitors on eBay

258
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
They cost $700

259
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Increase orders to

260
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Then he waits for them to come

261
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
By ship

262
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
All the way from

263
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:31,551
I'm so $1,400 later and almost three-and-a-half months of waiting I monitors finally

264
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
We arrived one came cracked

265
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Essentially split in half

266
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,719
Well one was perfectly great in working order the one that work

267
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,047
Was as beautiful as the monitor Chris had seen in Best Buy

268
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
So he does more digging

269
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
Call to contacts in Korea

270
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,679
Search is this US Customs data

271
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
The tracks every product

272
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
It comes into this country

273
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
And Chris figures out a few things

274
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,639
The panel for these monitors are being made at a single Factory in Korea

275
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,455
And what these guys are selling on eBay is

276
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Factory reset

277
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Pedals that work

278
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
But that have little flaws

279
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,367
What's the mean Apple won't sell them at retail

280
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,439
This means Chris and Monoprice

281
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,767
There's no way we're going to go out there by Factory Rejects

282
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,375
Rebuild a monitor to be like hey guys the new hotness is here buy it for $500

283
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,215
So for now Apple still gets the market for this fancy new monitor

284
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
All to itself

285
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
But about a year later Crystal during the day

286
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,823
Factory in Korea

287
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
Has expanded

288
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Production of the pan

289
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,199
Spider-Man for the fancy Apple monitor has not kept up

290
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:36,319
This means there may be a way for Chris and a model price to make a deal to get some of those magic

291
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,463
Chris goes to Korea to figure out whether the rumors are true or whether somebody still trying to pass off Factory Rejects

292
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:49,119
Once we were able to verify that we didn't have a cow bar little white unicorn we showed up with a lot of cash and

293
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
Ordered as many panels as we could

294
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
About nine months later

295
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
Monoprice started selling it

296
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
First version of that fancy

297
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,615
We sold it for it was

298
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
Sports for 2599

299
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
425 bucks

300
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,759
And Annapolis motor using the same screen with how much

301
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Doubler cost at 999

302
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
So you sold it for half the price

303
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
To be clear even though the panel

304
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
The screen is exactly the same

305
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Make the screen of the Apple monitor

306
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
That doesn't mean the whole package is eidetic

307
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Equal to an apple

308
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,119
One review of the Monoprice monitor had the headline

309
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
Poor design

310
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
Trumped by great screen low price

311
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,495
Spell Chris's.

312
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,055
The monitors they hit Monoprice sells a ton of them

313
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
It's a happy ending

314
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,359
But

315
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,663
As usually happens in the electronic business

316
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
Happy ending doesn't last for

317
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,551
Because Chris Appling was not the only one chasing the white unicorn model

318
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,135
Samsung actual product a similar monitor around the same time

319
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,183
And in the two years since the monitor came out

320
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
More factories are starting to make similar panels

321
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
More companies have started selling the monitors

322
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,863
Which of course keep getting better and keep getting cheap

323
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
How many people sell that monitor now

324
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,031
Samsung BenQ

325
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Dell

326
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
5

327
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Spotify FAQ

328
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,199
Is definitely got a lot tighter than what it was

329
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,527
More companies selling the monitor means more price competition

330
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,623
Which means he's monitors are moving from that category of something they cost too much

331
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,159
To the other category

332
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Of something

333
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
The good deal

334
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
The price of the monitor

335
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
Is now pretty close

336
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
To the cost of

337
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,375
The monitor Chris and I are staring at in the test lab

338
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,471
That is already several Generations beyond that first one he saw at Best Buy

339
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
4 years ago

340
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
And justice for all

341
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
Apple bread out the new monitor

342
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
That's even better than this

343
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
Chris once again is chasing after Apple

344
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,711
He says we can expect the Monoprice version

345
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
Sometime next

346
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879

349
