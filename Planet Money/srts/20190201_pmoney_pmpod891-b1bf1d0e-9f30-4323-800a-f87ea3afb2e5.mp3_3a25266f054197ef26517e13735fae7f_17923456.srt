00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:21,504
People make predictions about the future all the time

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,344
The right iPad say going TV but get interviewed on podcasts

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,624
And a lot of times

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,416
These predictions have this kind of

12
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,232
Weaselly unfalsifiable vibe

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
You know people say

14
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,584
I wouldn't be surprised if we see a recession next

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,424
The next hurricane season could be worse than ever

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,728
What does that even mean

17
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,056
How do I even know if you're wrong or you're right when you talk that

18
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:50,176
Even when people do make predictions that will clearly be true or false

19
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,784
You know there's no way unemployment will fall below 5% in our lifetime

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Whatever

21
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,136
Everybody forgets about those predictions by the time they're approved

22
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
Wrong

23
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,464
It does not have to be this way

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,512
There is a better way to live

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,560
When somebody makes a prediction

26
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,352
You can ask them a simple question

27
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
Want to bet

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,520
The thing I liked about bats and then someone's got to be wrong and at the end of the day they have to say they were

29
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:20,640
Yes and somebody gets to be right and if they end of the day they get to do the right dance

30
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:25,248
I'm I'm more way more interested in the concession speech that's the one you never get without the bet

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,832
So anyway kestenbaum back in January of 2014

32
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,720
Bitcoin was this relatively new thing that everybody who thinks about economics and Technology

33
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
What's making wild predict

34
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
And so

35
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:42,912
You know we were interested in the funeral so many question that alone

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,448
Don't we were interest

37
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,520
Didn't it but you know we definitely didn't want to have the weaselly

38
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
Non falsifiable prediction show

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,432
So we were thrilled when we found two really smart really thoughtful

40
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
Who are making

41
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,760
Very different predictions about

42
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,600
And who are willing to come on our show and makeup

43
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,184
They decided for 5 years and now today

44
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
Around today

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
Is today Ash it's been 5

46
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,216
The bet is up hello and welcome to Planet Money on Jake Goldstein

Today on the show who won and who lost

This message comes from NPR sponsor

Capital One na

62
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
This is a better the future of money

63
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Between two people

64
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
Red totally opposite

65
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,664
Each guy was completely convinced he was right on one side

66
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Was Ben Horowitz

67
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,528
Who's Venture Capital firm Andreessen Horowitz have bet 50 million dollars

68
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
And so I said why don't we just

69
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
And you said that in public when then came on the show

70
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,256
5 years ago to make the bet it was a time when you still heard a lot about this sort of like

71
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,608
Political libertarian like we don't need the government for money kind of

72
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
Kind of talk around Bitcoin

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
But then

74
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,704
Practical

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,312
I thought you know it was clever as a technology and it just solved this really

76
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
Basic problem with e-commerce

77
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
And that is

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,992
Companies that sell stuff online have to pay a really high fee to accept credit card

79
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
Like two or 3% of every sale

80
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Yours been back in 2004

81
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,440
Do you like at overstock.com which just started

82
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,744
Accepting Bitcoins

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,376
One of the interesting things about it as their margins are very low there yeah they're operating on like a 5-2

84
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
10% margins are two and a half percent

85
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
Is a

86
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Choochongkol

87
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
The prophets are there Bitcoin

88
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,104
Transactions are significantly more profitable

89
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:04,480
Don't been thought Bitcoin was about to take off as a way for people to buy stuff online

90
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,576
The guy who bet against Ben was a finance journalist named Felix salmon

91
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,880
Being challenged with that by Ben Horowitz his

92
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
Kind of high point of my career

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,488
And so IND rates for axios in the host

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Slate money podcast

95
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
5 years ago when he made the bet

96
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
The price of Bitcoin was skyrocketing

97
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
The Felix.

98
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
The rising price of Bitcoin was actually going to be

99
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,983
No problem because it was going to make it less likely

100
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
People would actually use

101
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Bitcoin to buy

102
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
Because Bitcoin

103
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
Office the potential for so much

104
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
Prophet just by sitting on it

105
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
And because it's an inherently deflationary currency which means

106
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,295
The longer you don't spend it

107
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
The more you benefit

108
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,207
Then everyone has an incentive to not spend that Bitcoins and Yukon

109
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
Have an effective payments mechanism

110
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
If you know

111
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
Spending account

112
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
So the question was

113
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
Where lots of Americans about to start using Bitcoin device

114
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
Back in 2014 we propose to bed

115
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,519
Let's wait 5 years to see what happens

116
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,079
And then take a pole across the country

117
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
Find out if people are actually using Bitcoin

118
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,919
I like this I like this

119
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
Let's let's take a representative poll

120
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
People in

121
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,343
Awesomest question happy use Bitcoin to painting

122
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,879
Fur Goods in the past

123
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Laughing

124
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
This good week is a week but that's a month

125
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,999
Because I want to be generous

126
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,839
What number been

127
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,143
What percentage of people are going to say yes

128
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
In five years time for that Quest

129
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,287
If 5 to 10% of the people who made payments to use Bitcoin

130
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
Like that's a lot of payments

131
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,639
What depends how much

132
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,199
They use it because if you only used it once a month

133
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
Temperature saying it's going to disappear

134
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
Eventually they settled on a number

135
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,903
If 10% of Americans or more

136
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
Said they bought something with Bitcoin in the past month

137
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Ben Woodward

138
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
The number was lower

139
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Felix Woodward

140
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
Mainstays of course would be

141
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
One person's right and one person is wrong

142
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:02,239
Hate to brag they decided they were going to get some

143
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,775
And they decided on

144
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,103
One of the first things you could buy with Bitcoin of game kind of famous for the

145
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
They decide to bet

146
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Pair of alpaca socks

147
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
One last thing

148
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,575
Will you guys both agree to come back on our show

149
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,879
Hopefully graciously it and top of it

150
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,207
5 years from now in 2019

151
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Absolutely

152
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
Five years pass

153
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
We got everybody back together

154
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Hello

155
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Hello

156
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Market

157
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
How are you

158
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Happy New Year

159
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,687
We're all here didn't pay Felix

160
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,711
Iban

161
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
Are you

162
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,831
Do you sound like you're the one I'm sure they'll fit

163
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Step in Time

164
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:54,207
When they make the bed five years felt like a really long time and then as I was walking over

165
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,511
To the studio to do the interview with you

166
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:01,631
I was just looking around the world and being like has the world look different from five years ago and the only thing I saw

167
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
Woody's motorized skateboard

168
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Basically the same

169
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,287
Yeah and Bitcoin it did not go away like Fela

170
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
In fact

171
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,127
The value of Bitcoin actually went you know when

172
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,967
Crazy write it when it was less than $1,000 when we first met.

173
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
It went all the way up to almost $20,000 it fell back down

174
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,855
Now it's around like $3,500

175
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
Which which three clear is way higher

176
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,951
Then it was when they made the

177
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
But the question was did people actually use Bitcoin to buy

178
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
I didn't know what the answer

179
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
And that is what we did the poll about

180
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,471
As promised we went out and got ipsos a real polling firm

181
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
To ask

182
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,055
900 some Americans

183
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Representative sample of Americans

184
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
This question

185
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
Have you purchased anything

186
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,967
Using Bitcoin as your payment

187
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
In the last

188
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
The percentage of Americans who said yes

189
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
3

190
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,951
Now they did ask those people the people who said they had they said

191
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
At what merchants did you make the perch

192
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,351
And I have some of those answers and it suggests that the 3% is a little

193
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:11,007
If you go down this list somebody said Gaia ethnobotanical which I looked up

194
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,847
In fact does accept Bitcoin Subway I think some subways

195
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Accept Bitcoin

196
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:22,271
But there's also a bunch of that say this one says Litecoin a few say coinbase which is a Bitcoin crypto crew

197
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Currency exchange

198
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,087
So these people are are using

199
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,903
Bitcoin to buy other cryptocurrency

200
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,183
Walmart is on there

201
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,743
Your Walmart is on there does not accept Bitcoin

202
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,071
So I think the 3% we can take safely as a ceiling and and

203
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
I feel like that the real number is probably what

204
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Well

205
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
Subhanallah

206
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
I did I did

207
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
And I actually would like to start the conversation by giving full credit to Felix and Felix please let me know you

208
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Your sock size

209
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:00,927
I will I will accept any thoughts in this photo of you know 11 ish

210
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Rain

211
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,279
Big all right all right those are on their way

212
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Thank you very much

213
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,863
So I have been where you wrong

214
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
Yes

215
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,495
Can I say I wish I was kind of disappointed by benza

216
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,799
I was wrong cuz he just said I was wrong

217
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,591
Like a really hard time saying

218
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
I was wrong I usually say really fast

219
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
All right I was wrong but

220
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:28,575
He just said like I was wrong yes and not only did he come to be in wrong head like this whole analysis of why

221
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
It was actually an impressive way to be

222
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
And I was wrong in two dimensions

223
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,511
And let me kind of gun to that one with timing

224
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
The first way in which she said he was wrong

225
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
The classic

226
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
I just didn't have enough time

227
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,471
Log a longer-term that I would have eventually I am right

228
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:50,335
But the second mistake is is a little bit more complicated also it's much more interest

229
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
And this is

230
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,687
Ben thought Bitcoin would work like other

231
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
Big open source technology

232
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
What you see with those kind of

233
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Project princess

234
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,927
Developers you know coders they just start solving one problem after another

235
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
So the projects just get better and better

236
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,535
That's the way the internet itself

237
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,119
Developed yesterday with no security but Lena like

238
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
We got security

239
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,983
Started out with no naming but we got that

240
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,823
There was no way to distribute addresses we got that feel like it just kept

241
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
Evolving a lawn

242
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
Because

243
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
It just met the needs

244
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,015
Of the user Community that's what Ben thought would happen with Bitcoin

245
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,855
He thought the code that powers Bitcoin would just get better and better and

246
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
Very quickly it would obviously be this safer faster and more private cheaper way for people to buy stuff on

247
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
That did not

248
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
No Bitcoin just became so valuable

249
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,167
That the people who worked on the system

250
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Didn't want to make it any

251
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,751
Better they just wanted to lock everything down and keep it the way it was

252
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,031
I think that

253
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
What happened

254
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
With Bitcoin is that

255
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,943
There is kind of one very very

256
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Strong need

257
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,319
Among the kind of investor / minors which is

258
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
That

259
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,647
The code in the meaning of

260
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
The code would not change

261
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
So basically

262
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
Felix was right the thing that he thought was going to happen happen

263
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,375
The fact of Bitcoins became so valuable method people

264
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,447
Didn't really want to use in the bicep they'd rather just hang on to them

265
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,519
But even be like this surprised by the way things actually turned out

266
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,615
I honestly I was looking back about I mean there were two things which

267
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
I

268
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
Expected

269
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Would happen

270
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,807
What if I expected the

271
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
Price would probably

272
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
And it didn't

273
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Way up into the

274
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Right

275
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,023
And the other is that I expected that would actually be used

276
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Over there

277
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
The following five

278
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,607
PS the even if

279
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,167
People when using it to buy stuff in

280
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Stores and that was my

281
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Excited

282
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
I imagined

283
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
Use permittance azure

284
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,383
Somewhere along the line it would have evolved if it especially if it

285
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,455
Grown to be worth thousands of dollars per Bitcoin

286
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
Then it would be used for

287
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
More valuable and less useful than you

288
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,951
Then if they didn't seem that like upset about losing her back

289
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
I have a theory about

290
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:20,863
Yes right so in the real world his firm invested tons of money in Bitcoin

291
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
And they seem to have done great

292
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
On those in

293
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
I think I've made a tremendous amount of money

294
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,127
Are we don't know exactly how they've done but one thing we do know is they were an early investor in this company coinbase which we mention

295
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,967
Recently coinbase was valued at 8 billion dollar

296
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
You were

297
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,551
Wrong about the bet

298
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
Alpaca socks

299
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
But right about the BET of

300
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
50 million.

301
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Yes yes I'm ahead

302
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
Ben still investing in companies that work with crypto

303
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Do you think

304
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
1013

305
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
X number of years

306
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
You know whatever 5 years

307
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
From now

308
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,103
Lots of people will use some cryptocurrency to buy stuff on a regular basis

309
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:11,039
Oh yeah I definitely

310
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,903
I feel like this is like taking candy from a baby

311
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,279
I think I'll be a bear I think yes

312
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
Yes I think there will be a bearer instrument

313
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
On the internet

314
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,447
Okay repeat the exact same bat

315
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,007
For another five

316
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,543
Titan Bitcoins

317
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,639
Then today is less convinced that he used to be

318
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:41,247
That Bitcoin in particular will be there cryptocurrency that people actually used

319
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
So this time for this bad

320
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
He wanted to make it about

321
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
Cryptocurrency more General

322
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,207
Play with that and then there was one other change you wanted to make

323
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,791
And that was he wanted to move it outside of the US

324
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
Because he said

325
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,399
Yes Credit Card fees are high in the US but let's be honest

326
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
Credit cards work really well here

327
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,775
So there's not that much of an incentive for people to switch to some

328
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
They want anyone to do in some country

329
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
Credit card we're not so wide

330
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
And wear if there are some nuke Simple app on your phone you left

331
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Apply for credit card UK

332
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,783
Pay instantly and easily

333
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
You know I might really take off

334
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
He said

335
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
What do the BET for Mexico

336
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
I'm perfectly happy to change

337
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Planet Money

338
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,327
It's very rare that you went to bed and then you get to go swimming again

339
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Ben what are the states

340
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Texas timer

341
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,055
But whatever you like we'll do something serious will do it will do it for a hundred-year-old bottle of Madeira

342
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,895
Henry Cavill bottom freezer actually maintained its value

343
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
For over a century

344
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Is

345
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,551
Find Portuguese fortified wine called Madera

346
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
And it gets better with age

347
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,159
And if you buy it you can drink it and nuts

348
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
And you're very happy person cuz it

349
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
It's delicious in if you don't drink it

350
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,559
You can keep it in your salad and it retains its value and

351
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,375
Let's go to a much better store of value

352
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Van

353
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Any cryptocurrency will ever be

354
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
So I will bet you

355
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,311
A hundred 100 year old bottle of Madeira

356
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Do you

357
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
I will not be able to find 10%

358
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
Mexicans

359
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
Cryptocurrency

360
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
In 5 years time

361
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Okay perfect

362
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:23,391
Custom you really wanted them also to include some kind of cryptocurrency in the back because that's what we know cryptic

363
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
Currencies are good for bedding

364
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,511
Eid

365
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
Bottle of wine in like some invisible

366
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Like I did I did

367
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:36,959
So they did add a cryptocurrency they decided in addition to the bottle of Madeira

368
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,567
Tibet something called an ether which is one of the big cryptocurrencies that's popped up in the last year

369
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,895
Yeah what one bottle of Madeira and one

370
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,735
Just got more colorful

371
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
Okay

372
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,807
Right now just for the record

373
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,111
A bottle of hundred-year-old Madeira

374
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,415
Cost between 500 and $1,000

375
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
And an ether cost around $100

376
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
I may change by the time

377
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Madeira Promenade

378
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
And pills could really win because

379
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:08,191
Is possible that no cryptocurrency is used in Mexico to buy

380
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:13,567
But still people are betting like crazy with ethernet switch

381
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
How you get the best of

382
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Or you can lose

383
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
Can I see that's what kind of frustrating about this bed for me

384
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,271
It's very gentlemanly I want somebody to like to admit

385
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,319
Total and utter complete

386
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
Failure

387
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
You know

388
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:32,255
Yes well it's tough when the guy who lost the bet to millions of dollars

389
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,071
In fact in fact last year

390
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,471
Ben's fermentery Subaru actually bet much more fun crypto that they have a birthday lunch this new

391
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:45,567
300 million dollar fund to invest in crypto related company

392
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
So obviously

393
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,687
A slightly bigger bed than a bottle of Madeira and an ether and we will be

394
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Tracking method

395
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,039
I think a few more Generations it's that it's going to be hard for them to make

396
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,855
2029 no way
