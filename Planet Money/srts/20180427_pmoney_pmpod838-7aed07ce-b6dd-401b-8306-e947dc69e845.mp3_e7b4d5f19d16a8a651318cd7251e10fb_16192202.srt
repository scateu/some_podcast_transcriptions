1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,816
When did you first get a weird package

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:06,144
About 3 years ago

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,424
This is Selena Salas

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,704
Chicago

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,496
And she can remember

6
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:14,592
Package came on a Wednesday sort of late in the afternoon

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,128
My actually I was

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,968
Working at a restaurant so I had just woke up she always

9
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,064
Go out from restaurant afterwards late at night so I was a little hungover

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
And I ain't

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,672
Just walked over to my mailbox and

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,696
There was this

13
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:34,304
Little brown package sitting in there perfectly

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
But she had an

15
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
Ordered it

16
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
It looked like it had shipped

17
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
From China

18
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,936
Because it's best she could tell

19
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,496
Most of the label was in Chinese

20
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,032
So I open the box

21
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:44,800
And

22
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,384
Justice watch wrapped in some plastic

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
But like the cheapest watch you could have match

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,064
Plastic like maybe spray painted gold or something it wasn't even working

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,856
So I need like food

26
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,160
Maybe my mom sent me this is a joke to like

27
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,744
Time to grow up get a watch

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,304
Good mom troll exactly

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,096
She checked not from her mom

30
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
But then

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,168
3 months later another package

32
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,216
To Selena

33
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
Apparently from China

34
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
Not something she ordered

35
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,592
And inside is

36
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
Like a

37
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:24,736
Braided friendship bracelet in first grade

38
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
Selena head

39
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,344
No explanation for this and there was nothing she could do

40
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,648
Was getting weird packages

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,672
And they kept

42
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,232
3rd package comes about 4th package

43
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,024
Comes about lights package

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Was

45
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
One of them had a crap

46
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,656
Ring inside she got a headphone case but no head

47
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
There was

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,568
Silly Putty Silly Putty I completely forgot about that when did that come that came after the piggy bank

49
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
Yep the other was a piggy bank as well

50
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
All of the weird junk

51
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
Pill Dan

52
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
Comparison

53
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
To The Fuzzy keychain

54
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
I think it was trying to mock like mink but it look like raccoon and it just was it was terrible

55
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
Yes it was

56
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,488
Terrible I opened it in like

57
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
But it dropped to the

58
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,352
Lauren it was that keychain should have never seen the light of day

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,936
These ghosts packages full of

60
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,472
Seemingly random John

61
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,312
There reports of people getting these all over the country all over the world

62
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
There was a woman in London who got not one

63
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
But to fake Nike sweats

64
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:32,576
There was a couple of your Boston who got a flashlight and an outdoor TV cover and woman on Long Island

65
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
You got some compression socks and a cell phone

66
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,232
Why are people being haunted by ghost package

67
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,816
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Nick fountain

68
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,120
And I'm Kenny Malone today on the show

69
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
We go

70
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Ghost

71
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
Package hunt

72
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,472
We learn how that crappy fuzzy

73
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
The keychain is a sign of the end times

74
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,592
Or at least the end of trusting five star review

75
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
It All Leads us

76
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,968
To one of the most elaborate internet schemes we have ever heard of

77
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,184
Support for this podcast in the following message come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,512
Developing solutions to support strong families and communities

79
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,840
To help ensure a brighter future for America's children

80
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,424
More information is available at aecf. Org

81
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
This whole ghost package thing

82
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
May sound a little bit

83
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
And that's because

84
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592
A version of this same phenomena

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Shut up

86
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
Surprising way

87
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,200
On a really

88
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
High stakes

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Public stage

90
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
Hello New York

91
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
This is from 2015

92
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,416
It's an elaborate opening bell ceremony for the New York Stock

93
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
Celebrating the Alibaba company

94
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Which organ public about a year old

95
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,984
Have you been in a cave for the last four years Alibaba is a massive company

96
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,056
That includes a bunch of e-commerce site some of them

97
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
Are like Marketplace

98
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
But connect sellers and buyers

99
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,664
Alibaba wechat

100
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,760
Huge deal when it decided to go public because it was a huge company

101
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,064
How huge you may ask

102
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Well

103
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,672
Here is the best part of any IPO my favorite part

104
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
Of IPOs

105
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,375
Prospectus Ali Baba's prospectus yet so a prospectus is when you go public you have to file this

106
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
Big

107
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
With a cc

108
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
And it says basically

109
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,007
All the good stuff is going on in your company and all the bats

110
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
As well you lay it all out

111
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,127
Yeah we come mazing juicy stuff and inside here

112
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
Here are some eye-popping number

113
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,575
We've got millions of sellers using our sites hundreds of millions of buyers hundreds of billions of dollars

114
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
Worth of stuff sold

115
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Intercourse

116
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Is good stuff

117
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
In this respect

118
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
But then there's also this one strange line

119
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
It's in the potential risk section of the document

120
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
And it says quote

121
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
Sellers May engage in

122
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,215
Tisha's or Phantom transactions

123
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,031
With themselves or collaborators

124
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,103
In order to artificially inflate their search results

125
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
Rankings

126
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,431
And you can imagine like a collective

127
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
What

128
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
Phantom transaction

129
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
Somebody needs to explain this

130
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,831
Hey Mark are you in the office right now

131
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
I am

132
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
Is it like 10:30 there

133
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
11

134
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
What is 11 p.m.

135
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
Still in the office

136
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
In Beijing

137
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
We called Mark natca

138
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
Can because he's with this company called marbridge

139
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Consulting and

140
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,167
Has been watching the Ali Baba story from the beginning

141
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:32,031
And Mark says Alibaba had no choice but to bring up this Phantom package thing

142
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
When it went public

143
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
Because it could be a big problem for investors

144
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
Yeah like sure Ali Baba had

145
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
250 billion dollars worth of sales on

146
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Sites

147
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
But some of those sales

148
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
May have been

149
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
Completely fictional transaction

150
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
How many

151
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Nobody seemed to know

152
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,023
Because hidden somewhere in those transactions was a phenomenon

153
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
An internet scheme really

154
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Known

155
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
As brush

156
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,423
Brushing is just

157
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Walmart gaming assist

158
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,751
Like what it what game is being

159
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
Normally

160
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
I'm a customer and I

161
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
Order something in the

162
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
Vendor send it to me

163
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:14,783
Then I rate the vendor based on your quality of the product delivery time

164
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
Mark is describing here

165
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
A basic

166
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
Verified reviews

167
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,975
Which only allows reviews from people who actually bought a Prada

168
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,535
Verified reviews are obviously used

169
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:31,935
Consumers but Mark says e-commerce site also use these as a way to rank the vendors who are selling

170
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
Meaning that you later

171
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
It's somebody

172
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,567
Some other customer goes and searches children's toys

173
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
United company any children's toy

174
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
Retailer that got high number of

175
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
Positive reviews

176
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,503
Which show up higher in search ranking

177
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
How important

178
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
Is this for a vendor

179
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Crucial

180
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,879
Absolutely crucial why is that

181
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
Because there's an ocean

182
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Avengers

183
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,791
Each of these platforms for any given product category

184
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
So

185
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,143
If your company is showing up on page 20

186
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
Might as well not be showing up

187
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,007
Answer to make sure that they didn't get buried under the ocean

188
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,567
Petition some very clever

189
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Figured out a way

190
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
The game the rankings

191
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
This is the technique

192
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
The people call brush

193
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
Engineering fake perch

194
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,295
In hopes of boosting your search

195
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
Do you I mean have you ever talked to any

196
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
Like people that did this any brochures

197
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
We have not

198
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,023
Do you think if we tried to talk to brushes they would talk to us

199
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
I'll be at your side if you have a

200
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
Fluent Chinese speaker

201
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,775
On the ground here

202
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
You might get them to talk to you but

203
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,639
Could be difficult

204
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Hi

205
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Hi Sandy Sandy Way

206
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
Fluent Chinese speaker

207
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,975
On the ground there is a colleague of ours who works out of

208
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
NPR's Beijing

209
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
We've heard

210
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,863
A term that used called brushing have you ever heard that

211
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Tickets a translation

212
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
The Chinese word is

213
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,031
Chardon it could be translated literally as

214
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
Brushing the record

215
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,871
I like cleaning up the reputation

216
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Yes

217
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Tennis is the site she's familiar with

218
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
Airbrushing allegedly happened

219
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Just called taobao

220
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,599
It's people in China selling all kinds of stuff to other

221
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,159
Close food

222
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Madison

223
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Flowers everything

224
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
You can either rent

225
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Boyfriend

226
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,863
Shenzhen taobao

227
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
How do I send boyfriend flowers

228
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,983
And she's heard that brushing is still a thing on that

229
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
We're wondering if you could

230
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,103
Try to find us some people who are brushing

231
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,407
You said I think I can do that for you

232
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
Awesome great

233
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
Sandy went off to see if she could find some

234
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,343
We knew it was a long shot so in the meantime

235
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
We decided to take a look at

236
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
Into a couple of other angles

237
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
I hate Sandy but within a day

238
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
Sandy was back on the phone with us again

239
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,095
We apologize for sending you on a wild-goose chase but

240
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,119
It's okay to

241
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Did you find any brochures

242
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,567
Yes no kidding

243
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,711
After the break a real life brusher shares her secrets

244
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,207
Support for this podcast in the following message come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

245
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:40,607
Developing solutions to support strong families and communities to help ensure a brighter future for America

246
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,935
Is children more information is available at aecf

247
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
. org

248
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,751
A couple of caveats

249
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
Before we meet

250
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
Our brochure

251
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
This scheme

252
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Got a lot of attention

253
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
Is it came up around the Ali Baba

254
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
IPO but

255
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,991
We talked to a lot of people about this and the general consensus

256
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:01,599
Versions of brushing are almost certainly happening in different ways

257
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
On different e-commerce

258
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Sites

259
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:08,255
If there's a way to game a review system you can almost guarantee that someone is trying to do

260
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
But because Alibaba is

261
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
Is often associated with this

262
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,631
We did reach out to them for the story

263
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
And they gave us a statement that said

264
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Impart

265
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
They have quote

266
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
No tolerance

267
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:19,007
Thanks for brushing

268
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
And that they've made huge strides

269
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
Infighting it however

270
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,431
It seems that it is still happening somewhere maybe on their sides maybe not

271
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,271
Because our NPR calling Sandy found a brochure in less than

272
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
Hello karaoke

273
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Yeah yes

274
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,207
I guess this is my Hutchins by chance

275
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
She lives near Shanghai and works in Tech but

276
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
In her free time she

277
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
Takes jobs as a brochure

278
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
When was the first time

279
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
That

280
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
You got one of these jobs

281
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
Okay

282
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Knee

283
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,567
Decent

284
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
When she was in college

285
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
But she can't remember

286
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Which year

287
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Exactly

288
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
Chances she gets about a buck for every brush

289
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
She helps out with a ton of money but it's

290
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,671
What kind of more fun for her stinks of it more like a hobby

291
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,975
So she does 10 to 15 of these Aman

292
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
And the way that works she says is that first

293
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
She goes into this chat

294
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,959
How it in attack prove someone will post a day

295
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,519
Information of the test

296
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
We need help

297
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Making a fake purchase

298
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,335
This is

299
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,895
Usually posted by a vendor or on behalf of

300
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Vendor

301
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
And there will be instructions

302
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,015
To go and buy a specific item from a specific

303
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
What sort of items

304
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Have you

305
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
Bought and given reviews

306
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,695
Beautiful

307
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Clothing

308
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
And shoes

309
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
Clothing and shoes

310
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,447
This is a completely fraudulent purchase but in order for the transaction to help with ranking

311
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
It has to look like a real world transaction

312
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
E-commerce sites try to spot this kind of funny

313
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Business

314
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
And The Crushers

315
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Try to hide this funny

316
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
Business by making fake purchases look

317
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
As normal as humanly

318
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
And so chin and her fellow brushes

319
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
Do all of these things to make themselves look

320
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Real

321
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
Like everyday indecisive online shop

322
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
The holy Stone

323
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:21,119
And randomly clicking to

324
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
There's a difference

325
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
Links scroll down page

326
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Go back

327
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
And then click the right thing

328
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,615
O so that it looks like you're searching

329
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
For the product

330
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:33,919
Yes

331
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,735
Omad and that is to make it look

332
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
Like a legitimate purchase

333
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
Sometimes the process is even more complicated like

334
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:48,767
Click around a bit favorite a couple things even talk to a customer service rep and then

335
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
Buy the item

336
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
But of course

337
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,631
This is not going to look like a verified purchase

338
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,703
Unless something get mailed to somebody

339
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,031
So the final steps of brushing her that she actually pays for the product

340
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
To get reimbursed later

341
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
And then the seller is actually going to ship something

342
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
But not the thing that she and pretended

343
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
Dunhill watches

344
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
It wasn't me

345
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
Scarves

346
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Socks

347
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
T-shirts

348
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
Shoes or something like that

349
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Issues

350
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
In other words what gets shipped

351
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
Are boxes full

352
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
Of seemingly random

353
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Stuff

354
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Which

355
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
Brings us all the way back

356
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
To where we started

357
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:35,871
The Fluffy keychain The Fluffy keychain with after the friendship bracelet

358
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
From Chicago

359
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,735
Then piggy banks fifth package was Silly Putty 6 would be the ring

360
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
And unlike and you're sure you didn't sign up

361
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
For some obscure subscription box service

362
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
I don't even know what what would connection

363
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
The assortment of things is just so odd

364
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
I can't even

365
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Thing 2

366
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
Who why who when where why

367
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
Why me

368
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
Why do things

369
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
Who are you and where is it coming

370
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
Okay so by Design

371
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
He's brushing skis are very dim

372
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
Call to track

373
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,639
Our best guess for what is happening to Selena

374
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
Is it her name

375
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,759
And her dress are being used in an international version of the brush

376
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
So I have a question about that

377
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,159
Did you have you ordered random stuff from China before

378
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Yes

379
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,279
I used to order phone cases a lot while I was in college

380
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
This address

381
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Okay

382
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:34,751
That's a clue always all a dollar and I thought it was the greatest deal ever like yeah I had to wait a month for that

383
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:35,775
To get here but

384
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:40,639
I have a cool phone case and then it turns out those phone cases break instead of your phone so

385
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,503
So I found it like it's not even worth it and

386
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
Stop buying those

387
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:52,671
You could imagine that Salinas address would be especially useful to a brush her she has

388
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
Buttstuff Direct

389
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
China before her dress

390
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Clearly still active

391
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,815
She looks like a real person

392
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
Kumite make this purchase

393
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,679
As we looked at this whole ghost package thing

394
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,471
We started to wonder

395
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
Who exactly is the victim here

396
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,079
There are arguably victims there are

397
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,639
Investors who buy into a company where

398
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,967
It's not entirely clear how many transactions are real

399
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
And how many are

400
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
Are fake does the sellers any sites that

401
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
Actually play by the rules

402
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
And then get

403
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
Be out by the vendors who were brushing

404
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:26,207
And then there are the online Shoppers you and me

405
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,303
Who think verified reviews light come on at least this is something I can

406
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Entrust

407
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
But it turns out

408
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Not always

409
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
One person who doesn't

410
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,239
Exactly feel like a victim here is Selena Sala

411
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
The Phantom packages were little

412
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
Creepy at first

413
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
But now she looks forward to them

414
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,895
Ensure she says d

415
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,223
Piggy bank broke almost immediately The Watch

416
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Never work to begin with

417
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Park at destroyed the

418
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
The furry keychain

419
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,367
But there was a ring that ring

420
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
The real metal ring

421
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
I like a little silver ring

422
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
Or

423
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,767
It's at the CID looks over but

424
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Right

425
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:06,399
Right I actually I'm wearing it right now actually

426
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,471
I've been wearing it and it has not turned my finger green yet

427
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
So

428
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
Yeah

429
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
Then a few can hear that but is there

430
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,831
