00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
Everyone drinking champagne

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,000

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,160
Auction fees it came to 2.7 million.

43
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Erect

44
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,976
For Nicholas longpre painting

45
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,024
And Records have been falling

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Left and right in the art

47
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840

48
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120

Dollars a record by a hundred million dollars

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
At an art auction

52
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
Salt 200

53
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
LOL

54
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
Thank you all very much indeed

55
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
As soon as the auction is over

56
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
They make me stop recording

57
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,808
Sotheby's doesn't want me wandering around with a recorder recording their high-end client

58
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
The art world is disc

59
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
They're always

60
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
But on my way out

61
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,976
As I was in line at coat check

62
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,536
Distemper British gentleman said something

63
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
You absolutely have to do the ACT

64
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Open right now

65
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
He said

66
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
I have it on good authority

67
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
March of the sod

68
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
Came from Storage

69
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,288
And much of it will end up in storage

70
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
That is that is not bad

71
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
All that's to say

72
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
That some of this art

73
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,456
May never wind up on some

74
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Wall it

75
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
May never even end up in a museum

76
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,344
The money pouring into art as an investment

77
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
It's causing some of the Worlds

78
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
Greatest treasures

79
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928

Today on the show we take you into a

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Shadowy world

84
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
Where investors are piling money in

85
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
Into the greatest visual works of our culture

86
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
And then hiding

87
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,664
We go on a mission to find out where they are

88
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
And why they're there

89
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,344

So we're on a mission

102
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,576
To figure out where all this artist

103
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
And again

104
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
It's very secretive

105
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
But I was told

106
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
There's a woman in Los an

107
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Who knows the art world see

108
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,072
My name is Amber Noland

109
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,352
Is an artist yourself

110
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Curatorship

111
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,704
Art school one of her sculptures was it at a female pirate

112
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
These days she works on the business

113
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,056
Decide treating art as a tangible asset

114
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,848
A way to store your money

115
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,920
People in the industry describe Amber as

116
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
The closer

117
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
To like what does it mean that you're the closer

118
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,064
It means that I will do anything

119
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
2

120
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,648
Find a solution to fix the situation

121
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,952
Okay so like anything

122
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
I mean that sound

123
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,559
A little dramatic be I don't knock anyone's needs out

124
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
Whatever actually does is

125
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:24,191
For the past 24 years she's managed art for wealthy collect

126
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,727
One day she'll be

127
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
Helping a client block off a major

128
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:33,151
Street and use a crane to install a roof on another day she's dealing with a heist

129
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
At a stoplight

130
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
Somebody lifted

131
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,039
The backend of the truck and took the art that was in there

132
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,879
Is about 4 pieces of work that we're really valuable

133
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,671
Never found again

134
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,743
Some days she's going into an ancient Library

135
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
Twins back to work

136
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
By Leonardo DaVinci

137
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
What was it

138
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:52,863
Chaos

139
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,167
That I can't tell

140
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,775
She can't tell me because then you could Google it and then you'd know who our client is

141
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
Amber is discrete because she works with billion

142
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,175
A nurse in a high-end art world you have a broker for your stocks

143
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,967
And you have Amber for your heart

144
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
I'm handling the actual

145
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
Physical aspect of

146
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
Their high-end

147
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,231
So they've got a 3 million-dollar painting and the overall collection is probably valued at

148
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
Anywhere from 500 million to a billion

149
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
What

150
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
Wow

151
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,399
Amber has run 40 full time

152
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,215
Client ensure many of them are art lovers

153
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:34,847
But some of them see art as a place to put their money like a better version of $1000000

154
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
Sure it's a place to invest a bunch of cash

155
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
But you can't move in apartment

156
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Anywhere in the world

157
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,527
Whenever you want

158
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
So these investors they

159
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
By the art they want the art

160
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
But they don't necessarily want to

161
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,743
Run a museum they don't want to have to hire guards they don't want to have to worry about

162
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Mold or

163
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
Temperature whatever

164
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,863
So it's not going anywhere it's not hanging up in anyone's house

165
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
It's not

166
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
Ready for the latest dinner party

167
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
So Amber explains

168
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
She tells her clients look

169
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,055
If you're really buying this artist and investment

170
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
You want to keep it safe

171
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
You don't care if it hangs on a wall

172
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
She tells her clients

173
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
There's this option

174
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Something called a freak

175
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
A Freeport

176
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
It is

177
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,879
This weird kind of Zone where a lot of Art

178
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Is headed east

179
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
Their enormous buildings are usually near airports where art

180
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,511
Just

181
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Sits

182
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
And weights

183
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
And hopefully gets more valuable

184
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,655
And the strangest thing about these freeport's

185
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Is that the sort of

186
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Exists between worlds

187
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,543
So say I buy work of art in London

188
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
If I send it to a Freeport

189
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
Luxembourg

190
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,663
It has a really entered Luxembourg

191
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
Is between countries

192
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
It's in a sort of

193
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Customs limbo

194
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
Amber says as

195
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
Art closer fixer whatever her job is

196
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,159
She has ended up placing about

197
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
300 million dollars worth

198
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
A client art in this

199
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,839
And there's one other big reason Ambersons all that are into

200
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
If reports

201
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
Taxes

202
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,447
Reports are used in the art world

203
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
To hold work

204
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
To delay

205
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Taxation

206
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
So

207
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,895
The work can live there and be immune to any type

208
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
Of Taxation

209
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
Amber gave me an example of how this work

210
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
Sarah client bought a work of art from million dollars

211
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:23,135
Is that client buys art in York at Sotheby's

212
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
He has to pay the New York sales tax

213
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,975
8.875 /

214
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
That 88

215
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Thousand

216
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
$50 but

217
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
Maybe he sends that

218
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Work of art

219
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Straight to Freeport

220
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,983
Maybe in Geneva or Singapore

221
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
She doesn't have to pay that tax

222
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
And that's a lot of money that's a lot of money

223
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
A lot of money

224
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
That you don't have to

225
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Pay until you

226
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
You take that artwork

227
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,711
Out

228
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,735
Which could be

229
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
A long long time it could

230
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Be forever

231
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
You might even be able to

232
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
To use that art

233
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
Stowed away

234
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
As a kind of cat

235
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,695
Taking a loan out against

236
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,999
It seems like a great deal for our donors

237
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
And a bad deal for government

238
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:06,399
So I called up the federal office which regulates these zones here in the US

239
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
And they didn't get back to me for an interview

240
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,263
But I did get in touch with Joshua Kaufman

241
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,335
A lawyer in Washington DC who specialize

242
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
And I asked you

243
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
What is the incentive for the

244
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,479
Increase

245
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,271
Trade in the porch

246
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
Anthony dustrial stimulus

247
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
People building those warehouses

248
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
They're paying real estate taxes

249
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Facility

250
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
They're shipping cargo there

251
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
If we go because they're lost it says

252
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
You know there's economic

253
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
Benefits spin-off by having

254
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,287
Then sure maybe there is some economic spin-off by happy

255
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
But

256
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,127
It's also true that these reports have become one of the

257
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
The standoff

258
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,735
Places compete to have rich people do business there

259
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,087
If Geneva has a Freeport everyone will do their art business in Geneva

260
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,135
So Luxembourg has to have one too

261
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:04,511
And Singapore West saw this and thought they're getting on this too and so now there are

262
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Freeport Indian

263
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
United States

264
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,143
But the other weird thing about Freeport is it they're not at all new

265
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,239
It's just that being an art tax Haven was not at all what they were intended

266
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,383
No they started in the mid-1800s in Switzerland but they were originally built for things like grain and tea

267
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
Green and T

268
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
You can't store it forever

269
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,479
Is short-term storage

270
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
And that's why the Swiss government said

271
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Hay Merchant

272
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,367
You can store your goods here for now without

273
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,927
Taxes you can worry about taxes later on

274
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,207
When someone buys art

275
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
Overtime rich people started

276
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
Realized

277
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
There's this temporary layover we can

278
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
Twitter gold our wine into

279
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
Tax free

280
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,055
And no one seems to care that we're keeping it here

281
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
Long-term

282
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,431
In the last 50 years or so art collector started keep their art in Freeport

283
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
In the state of Texas pension

284
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
For as long as they want

285
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
And of course we were dying

286
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
To see the inside of

287
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
One of these places

288
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
The challenge

289
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,927
Is it there

290
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
Are not advertised they're not open

291
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
Open to the public they are sort of like

292
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
In time

293
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
After the break

294
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
We go to a Freeport

295
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,167
In America's favorite tax Haven

296
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191

How to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain

309
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:54,847
So I went down to Delaware with a guy named Fritz Dietl he's wearing glasses blue jean

310
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:01,247
Blue shirt blue coat I like Picasso's blue period

311
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,575
In Austria he became an apprentice as you do in Austria

312
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,415
His apprenticeship was an art Logistics and he loved it

313
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
He was transporting famous works of art

314
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:16,607
All over Europe

315
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Art but

316
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
She was noticing

317
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,263
At rent some of his client in New York were sending their art back

318
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
These freeport's

319
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
In Europe

320
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,615
Everett he wanted it

321
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
She wanted to build his own Freeport

322
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,575
Just like a big white building

323
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:42,975
Why you like it like that

324
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:49,375
Well what's going on inside so we get out it's very

325
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,519
It's snowing Fritz rings the bell we need another Austrian the building manager

326
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,919
How are you you take me inside where I signed a visitor book so this might

327
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,735
Sound like a weird question but are we technically

328
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,391
Where are we now in America definitely still in America

329
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:17,791
We are at designated foreign trade zone Warehouse so for US Customs purposes

330
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,631
We have some property here that hasn't

331
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
Formally enter the United States

332
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,751
Puppy is still under US Customs control

333
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,799
Fritz takes me through loading dock

334
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Lots of boxes

335
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,199
And then he takes me to the back of the warehouse where the building manager opens up

336
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,599
A huge metal gate

337
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
Cavernous

338
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
20 foot ceilings

339
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,375
And as far back

340
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
As far as I can see

341
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,823
Boxes so I'm looking down and I see wooden boxes

342
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,479
Wrapped up crates everything we only store artwork

343
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,087
I thought about something the former director of the Luxembourg Freeport one set

344
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:17,183
But he didn't want freeport's to become cemeteries for art

345
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
But what was I looking at

346
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
I was looking at a bunch of Art

347
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
In wooden boxes

348
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
Kind of look like coffins

349
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
Princeton let me look for long

350
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,495
I clearly wasn't going to be allowed among the Priceless artwork

351
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,591
You just turned off the light is do you keep it in darkness

352
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,919
Absolutely

353
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
Close the gate

354
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,295
So we went out to the front room and talk for a while with some boxes nearby

355
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
So this could be a sculpture or painting you can't tell me what's in Chinese

356
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,351
And I'll tell you what's inside

357
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:01,983
About the size of the water lilies

358
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
And this is the thing about free

359
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,079
Steak to make it so

360
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
Tempting if you are a narc

361
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
Poured money into this work

362
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
Is take that work of art

363
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Box it up

364
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Store it out of

365
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,111
So I called him Joshua Kaufman the attorney again

366
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
When I pressed him

367
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,695
Why are people okay with the system

368
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,047
System that makes it profitable to put great works of art in storage

369
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,143
You're not using yard this system encourages people

370
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
To put their art and warehouses

371
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
To invest in

372
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
Yeah I mean it's waves

373
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Looking at it

374
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
I am

375
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
If I get anything else

376
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
People invest

377
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
Denart

378
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,199
St. Augustine real estate they just in all kinds of you know

379
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Places

380
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,783
But you can see a building you can see real

381
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,087
You know of.

382
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,671
I guess you know that sitting in a Freeport

383
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
You and I

384
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
We can't see

385
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Well I mean

386
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
Stop making that argue

387
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
Great extent about

388
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
But you know all great artists and private collection

389
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,935
Somebody what I don't want it on them

390
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,263
But those people do I guess I could go to my Freeport and sit in

391
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,799
My room and look at my art

392
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,615
I saw another piece near the loading dock as I was

393
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
It wasn't in a box it was wrapped in plastic

394
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,735
I found one piece of art

395
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
One Resort that I could see cuz there's a

396
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
Clear plastic over it

397
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,439
It's like a lot of white paint

398
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Kind of sunglasses

399
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
Are smoothies that I can see

400
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,119
Later I figured out who would painted that one piece I did see

401
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
I tried to get in touch with her

402
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,007
I wanted to ask her what she thought about her art being in a warehouse

403
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
But you didn't want to talk

404
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:44,895
Sure cuz I mean I can imagine this is all pretty Bittersweet like on one hand

405
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
You sold a painting in the

406
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Art Market

407
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
Is booming which is

408
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Is great but

409
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Arguably

410
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,063
All of this booming has

411
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,855
Contributed to more and more

412
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Works of art

413
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Being stored

414
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Away

415
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
In these like anti-music

416
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,815
Yeah Kenny the two of us will be looking at art in books

417
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
The real art

418
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,375
Start itself

419
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,703
It might be sitting in darkness

420
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,479

In the market
