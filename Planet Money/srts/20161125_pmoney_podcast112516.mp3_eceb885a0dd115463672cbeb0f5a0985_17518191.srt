1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:02,560
Lots of kids dream of being Cowboys

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,608
But Sean weeks always knew he was

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,912
His mom put him on a horse before you can talk

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,472
I'm actually a 4th generation cowboy

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:15,360
That's my family history but he is lassoing

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,152
A stack of square hay bales

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,688
What kind of dummy ball

8
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,480
He's just like throw

9
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,760
Cinch repeat

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,832
This is not at all distracting from the interview

11
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,136
A rope was actually my first toy

12
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:33,280
Yeah but even for an experienced Cowboy like Sean it is harder to find work

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,864
America has fewer cattle than it has it anytime soon

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
Since the 1950s

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
And cowboy Cruz or smaller

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
And more specialized

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,800
Sean Weekes found himself traveling farther and farther to find

18
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,336
From Idaho

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
Nevada

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,408
The Texas there's a couple of times that I

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,992
Take a step back cuz I wouldn't have enough time with my family and

22
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,040
And move to town and

23
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Drove a truck

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
Whole couch

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,208
And I actually spent less time with my family

26
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,512
And so

27
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,072
I just went back to the being a cowboy

28
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,144
And then a couple of years ago Sean got this call that he

29
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Barely believe

30
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
A recruiter from a cattle ranch

31
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,984
Offered to pay him

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Double

33
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,056
There was one catch

34
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
This Ranch would be a bit

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
Farther

36
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
East

37
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
The only thing I really knew about Russia's just from

38
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,272
What little bits of information that I

39
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,552
Her growing up

40
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
What Sean was ready for a change

41
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,648
And maybe a chance of attending relay for spam

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
So 3 months after that phone call

43
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
Fill the suitcase

44
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,000
To this one is close

45
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
And the saddle is Dad made for him

46
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
Are 44 years old

47
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Sean Weekes

48
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,168
Flew to Moscow

49
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,264

When sean gets Russia

65
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
He found himself on a ranch

66
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
In the southwest near the

67
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
Ukrainian border

68
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,184
It's a ranch owned by a massive Russian mean

69
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,744
The company is called me rhetoric

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
Reporter Irina zhorov at WHYY

71
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:47,168
He's been digging into this company me retarded yet they're one of the biggest Russian suppliers

72
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
A pork and chicken everything they do seems to be really huge

73
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
But in 2010 they got even bigger

74
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
They bought a bunch of land in the province of briansky

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
Obudu cattle ranch

76
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:02,784
And make American style Angus steak I went to the dance can I visited a couple of these ranches

77
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:08,160
And their enormous sometimes it can take hours to get from one Farm to the next one

78
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
Each one of these red

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,512
Has a hundred times more cows

80
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
In the average American read

81
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:18,144
And there are 60 of these farms and they're all owned by this one Russian

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,448
Company I've never seen anything girl this time

83
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Havre

84
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,520
Its huge

85
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,336
Champs Auto Sales that this Ranch did feel

86
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Weirdly familiar

87
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,944
But you've seen it all before you know the way this horse Act

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
Key points of the horse that he's riding

89
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Sources Jack

90
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
Jackie thinks he's an old American racehorse

91
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,672
Which is actually very possible because all the horses on this Ranch

92
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,696
Are American Expo

93
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Like Shawn

94
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
They have to import everything

95
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,376
Not only did me rhetoric import 500 American Quarter Horses

96
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,656
500 saddle

97
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
100000 American cows

98
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,520
The imported grass from Europe

99
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,616
Parasite Killers for the animals and vaccines for them

100
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,152
60000 units

101
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,552
The bull semen to artificially inseminate the cows and 10 ultrasound machines to check when they're pregnant

102
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,112
And then of course they recruited American Cowboy

103
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
Spiked Sean weeks

104
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,696
To teach the Russians how to care for the cows

105
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
How to move to

106
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
From Pastor to Pastor

107
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
My first day

108
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Pretty stressful

109
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
Really

110
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
Is Russian students worth

111
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Totally new

112
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
To all this

113
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
Equipment they were new to these kind of horses did never dealt

114
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,263
Breed of cattle

115
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,823
They're nervous they're they're scared there's nothing wrong with that

116
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
Hey you just got to learn how to control it

117
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
Shante is okay I'll start with the base

118
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
How to tie a lasso knot

119
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
And when to show up for work in the morning

120
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
Sun up

121
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,367
Especially in the summertime it gets hot

122
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
In the afternoon

123
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
Cattle and horses don't do well in the heat

124
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,511
But you insisted his Russian students still just didn't seem to get

125
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,303
The whole cowboy thing

126
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
There's a lot of things that you just

127
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
You see and you really don't even want to believe yourself

128
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
So what's your like favorite story to tell

129
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
I had a deal Last Samurai I got asked to go to a place where they were passed during a bunch of steers

130
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
Tachanka rework

131
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,575
600 steers that has been moved from one pasture to another

132
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
Which to him was like no big deal

133
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
Okay

134
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
What's the problem

135
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
He was thinking why can't the Russian Cowboys just do that then

136
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
So I got there and I

137
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,071
Me and two other guys were moving them across the pasture

138
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
Andis cattle started getting real nervous

139
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,543
And that's what the heck why all the sudden I hear this chi chi chi ching and I want in the world and I turn around trying to find

140
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
The sound

141
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,663
Here comes to guys riding over the hill behind the sun bicycles with the little

142
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
Handlebar bells on them

143
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:44,063
They thought cuz they ride around on bicycles all the time that that would be the way to do things which

144
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Scared

145
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
They scared the cat

146
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,439
That that turned into a bad Fiasco

147
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,511
I love herding cows with a bicycle Bell

148
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
Nescac every American Cowboy on this Ranch seem to have some story like this

149
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,703
What's with the Russians getting creative about their cattle duties

150
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
In ways that the Americans

151
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Couldn't even dream

152
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,823
So I have to see Gregory I mean I grew up in

153
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
My parents own a cattle ranch

154
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Cowboys

155
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
It's not a job that is like any

156
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
The other job I mean on any given day you might be

157
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,599
Defensor pulling a thousand pound cow out of a gold

158
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,903
Or if you helping a cow give birth

159
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
In the middle of a blizzard at 4 in the morning

160
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,791
Don't we look out there and see something that needs to be done we go do it

161
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,655
Anomie is an incredibly hard work and you're dealing with big animals and big machinery

162
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,423
Dangerous

163
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,287
I've got a tore up body to prove it and I've broken pretty much every bone in my body

164
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,359
Riding on horses and dealing with cows and

165
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
You commit your mind body and soul to this

166
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Dispatch

167
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,551
This romantic idea of the cowboy that a lot of Americans grow up with

168
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,647
This was not how many rhetoric the Russian company was approaching it

169
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,719
Declan Irina visited these ranches she found that they weren't even

170
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Calling them

171
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
They called them

172
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Operator

173
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,863
Every Ranch that I visited I saw these

174
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,447
Posters he's laminated sheets of paper with instructions on them

175
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,495
And it's instructions for things like

176
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
How to fix a fence

177
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
How to load

178
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Cattle into a trailer

179
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
How to rope a steer

180
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
I think they were even illustrations

181
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Which like

182
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:22,111
You know I used to report on ranches in the States you would never see anything like

183
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
Like that and all the sudden it seemed like

184
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
This whole Russian operation

185
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,767
Which member was bigger than any single Ranch in the United

186
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,351
Was also liking Ikea version of a cattle ranch

187
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Shipped over

188
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
Assembled with instructions

189
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,495
Not everyone can I walk with Keto

190
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
It's a

191
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Difficult

192
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,639
That's very similar laws here and mirror towards beef operation

193
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
From Farm to slaughterhouse

194
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,199
Lucy says

195
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,271
Annie's at the Cowboys were the biggest challenge by

196
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,087
Far they kept hiring Russian Cowboys and

197
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:59,487
Firing them you're right it's a it's a challenge in all the mirrors are Executives including

198
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Larry we're trying to figure out

199
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Why

200
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
Was it

201
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
The workout

202
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,911
Or was it the job skills or was it some kind of personality

203
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
Comfortability with animals

204
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
And it was all those things

205
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
But you ask Sean weeks

206
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
He said it was something Beyond.

207
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,895
Because being a Cowboy is more than a job

208
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,455
The more cattle in the more weight that I produce

209
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,503
The more money I make it the end of the year

210
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
But it's also a pride issue with me

211
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
I want you to look a knife cattle

212
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
You know porterhouse steak

213
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
Heading for the reason

214
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
What's the luxury product

215
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Because you're not supposed to

216
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Have to do much to it in the kitchen

217
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
Play all the preparation is happen

218
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
On the ranch

219
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
When Sean takes Pride that his cows are well

220
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
It's because everything that have

221
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Slim Andres watch

222
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
In some way goes into the taste and the culture of cowboying

223
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
Has grown up around

224
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Which is making me hungry

225
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:53,759
You brought this is some Russian beef but it is not

226
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Islam guy

227
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
So interesting

228
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
Yeah

229
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
Because the thing is Russian so mixtape what they make

230
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
This is a Galaxy

231
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Stuffed cabbage

232
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
I had a Russian home

233
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
I'm so this came

234
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
Oh my gosh really yes

235
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Stacy one

236
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Just cut in there

237
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,703
Do I try it yet or is some sour cream

238
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
I will always put sour cream

239
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Flip the beef

240
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
Fit in this day

241
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Dish

242
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
You know it's prepared in a very

243
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Very different ways

244
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
No no it doesn't know I mean it tastes like it's

245
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,927
Savory and salty and and delicious but it doesn't

246
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
Taste like beat this could be I mean

247
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
Chicken

248
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Porker

249
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,119
Yeah because one of these are traditional Russian food is it is

250
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
The recipe does coffee

251
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
It's boiled

252
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
Or student for a long time like these

253
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
These cabbages

254
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
I think the recipe calls for

255
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
For boiling for 2 and 1/2 hours

256
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,223
And the reason is is because

257
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
Russians have traditionally

258
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
Pharmd

259
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Dairy cows

260
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
A dairy cows

261
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,391
Are there meat that it's not fat

262
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Angus Cattle

263
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,207
They're going to tough and leave

264
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,839
They definitely don't fatten up in the same way and they're also a lot more docile as animals are a lot easier to

265
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,887
Dairy cows in these cattle

266
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
Two different monsters

267
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,287
Shawn says actually nothing about raising dairy cows

268
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
Which the Russians have done for centuries

269
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
Prepares you for raising

270
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Black Angus Cattle

271
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,223
The dairy cattle are used to being around people all the time

272
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,527
These cattle are raised out in the open

273
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,087
And so they're borderline Wild

274
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,135
And so you got to learn how to handle them

275
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,231
And if you don't handle them right it turns out ugly

276
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
So Gregory my question is this I mean having just

277
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
Senior tuition

278
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
Cabbage

279
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
Why make American states in Russia

280
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
Why don't you stick to dairy cows

281
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,239
If you think about how

282
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,031
Cattle farming start in America

283
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
It was because we had all this land

284
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
In the American West

285
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,407
Russia season opportunity

286
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
They have all this cheap

287
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,735
People and they want to use it too

288
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,831
Create a beef industry that not only can export beef to

289
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:09,695
China and the Gulf State but maybe potentially create thousands of new jobs in Russia

290
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
End

291
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
The Russian company Meritor

292
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
Also has an important Ally

293
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,327
In this fight

294
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
A

295
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,679
Horse riding tiger hunting steak eating president

296
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,239
I think I know who you might mean

297
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
And Vladimir Putin

298
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Very much wanted this Russian people

299
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
The Russian government

300
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,919
Help clear nearly 2 billion dollars

301
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,199
In low-interest loans

302
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
Plus a bunch of subsidies

303
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
Amir torges buying

304
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Moreland

305
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
They're building more rat

306
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,927
They say their first word will top 1 billion cows by the end of the decade

307
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
When Mary took Thomas's

308
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,511
The beef industry will finally be profit

309
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,071
But they have to figure out how to solve

310
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
This Cowboy's

311
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:52,447
How do you squeeze a hundred fifty years of cowboy history

312
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Into a decade

313
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
Well near torque says

314
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Has found a way

315
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
To teach their Russian workers

316
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
The very spirit

317
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Of the American West

318
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
They have imported

319
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
One more signature aspect

320
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Of American Cowboy life

321
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
The rodeo

322
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,095
Okay so here we are at the Russian Rodeo it is

323
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,679
The 3rd annual Rodeo that me rhetoric has posted

324
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,615
And everything here is really similar to what you'd see it in American Rodeo but

325
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,919
A little Rusev I'd so

326
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:40,319
There's the same offense barrel racing roping trailer loading and the songs that the teams enter to

327
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,415
Are patriotic leak in the US but here there about the mightiness of Russia

328
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:51,071
Where there's another song

329
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:57,471
And about how America should give Alaska back to Russia and the chorus is something like don't be an idiot America

330
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,807
The radian the US didn't used to be this like big Affair you know now the rodeo championships happened in Vegas it's very

331
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
Flashy

332
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:18,207
But it started out in a very similar way Wars are better than your Cowboys my horses are better than your

333
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
Jessica way to show off

334
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
And build camaraderie

335
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
That honestly is a big help

336
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,887
Especially if you get some of your own agent

337
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
You're competing against them

338
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
Trying to learn the to be better

339
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
I'm about to go into battle

340
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
Let's go rope something boys

341
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
Sean is here at the rodeo he is

342
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
Coaching a team of Russia

343
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,343
It says that this Spirit of competition

344
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
This house turn a job

345
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Infopass

346
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,487
It makes you want to master all these really tough skills

347
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
Keep working at it

348
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Shawn how's your team doing

349
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,119
What's up Sean team is not doing so hot

350
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
Yeah they're doing okay

351
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:04,287
Train them up pretty good I can do better than that and they know it and I know it too

352
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
When Sean got to Russia

353
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
She was frustrated

354
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
If you wanted the Russian Cowboys to measure up

355
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
The Americans

356
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Now he just wants them to measure up to

357
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
And self

358
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
Andrea the Russian team

359
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
When Sean's Contracting

360
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Expires the end of this month

361
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
He can go home knowing that

362
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
He will leave something behind

363
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
Russian cowboy and culture

364
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
Maybe you can be a thing

365
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Maybe

366
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
But they're still struggling

367
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Either in skill or

368
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
Motivation

369
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
Gorgeous Cowboy nose

370
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
But Irina says she did me this one guy

371
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
The rodeo

372
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
The guy who she

373
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Brisket walking by because

374
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
She assumed he was American

375
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,663
He was dressed like an American which is why I confuse them he had a cowboy shirt on and

376
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:47,551
Jeans and a slight camouflage vest and button-up shirt and boots and everything and he just had this like

377
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,135
Aura about him like he kind of stood with his

378
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
Arms on his ways than

379
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
Mike looked up in his hat would be to

380
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
Tobacco bet you know he just had like a way about him

381
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
And so when I

382
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,375
I heard him speaking Russian I was like oh

383
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,983
This Cowboy's name is Sergei Sergei Schilling

384
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:12,383
And he's bashful only approximate the American Cowboy

385
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
As if he knows he's

386
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
Counterfeit copy

387
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,527
He tells Arenas at on his first day on a saddle horse that was

388
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Three and a half years

389
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
He almost fell off

390
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Get really embarrassed

391
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
He nearly quit

392
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
Only

393
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
His wife convinced him to return to the ranch

394
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Keep trying

395
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
And now he feels himself

396
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
Bully

397
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
A cowboy

398
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
Get some point he got offered a position as a manager and he said

399
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
No cussing

400
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
Wants to be around the animals

401
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
Everything about it has become very dear to him

402
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:46,431
Convertible

403
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
And as he's explaining this

404
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Tips his hat

405
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Wide Brim

406
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Black felt

407
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599

408

American Samoa

410
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
This hat

411
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,511
Gifted to him by an American Cowboy named David

412
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,095
After he lassoed his first ear and the booties wearing

413
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
They were present from another Cowboy Kurt

414
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Pristine

415
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447

00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007

420
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
As himself

421
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Became something new

422
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Yeah

423
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
And he believes in the future of the Russian cowboy

424
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,783
Oh for sure yeah so he has a four-month-old son

425
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,831

426
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599

To train them up as a cowboy to

He's never tasted a steak

00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,351
