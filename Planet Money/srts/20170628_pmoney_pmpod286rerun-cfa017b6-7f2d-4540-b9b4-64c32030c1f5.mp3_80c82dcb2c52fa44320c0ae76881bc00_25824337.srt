I can tell today's podcast is at least in part

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,600
An effort on your behalf to

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:32,256
Take a lovely little mini-vacation to Northern New Hampshire and have an excuse to expense it to Planet Money and then p

00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,024
PR

11
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:38,656
Not up to the beautiful White Mountains of Northern New Hampshire close to the Canadian border

12
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,216
Purpure reportorial reasons

13
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,264
It is the site of the porcupine

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,032
Freedom Fest

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,336
And the people that call themselves porcupine

16
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
Because they're cute

17
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
The cuddly

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,408
And you don't want to mess with

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,992
And at first glance the Freedom Festival looks like

20
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,040
The other festival there's tents

21
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,064
Does young people

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,344
Is line for the bathroom

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
But you know how if you're into art or alternative culture you go to Burning Man every year absolutely but if you love me

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,280
Music you going to Bonnaroo

25
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
Sure all the time

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,072
I've no idea

27
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,888
Well if you think the Federal Reserve is illegal

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,496
That we should return our money to the gold standard if you believe we should abolish the IRS

29
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,288
When you go to the porcupine Fest

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
The pork Festival

31
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,200
And we should say we're talkin obviously about libertarian these are like big L libertarian

32
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,040
We talked a lot about the libertarian philosophy here on planet

33
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
I think it's important

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,648
Different ways of being a Libertarian summer

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,208
True anarcho-capitalist thinkers

36
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:40,352
No government but most Libertarians I've talked to believe there is a role for government but a very small limited one

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
Largely to

38
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,168
Protect property rights to

39
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,520
Set the conditions so that citizens can make arrangements amongst themselves

40
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
You don't need to be so much regulation

41
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,104
And it shouldn't be so much too

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,872
Taxation

43
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,664
Libertarians generally think

44
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,480
It's not the government's business whether or not I do drugs

45
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
Who I marry

46
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
What food I eat

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
And we probably series before on planet

48
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,440
But we wondered how do you make it work in real life how do you

49
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,464
Buy things

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,072
In a Libertarian Society how do you eat breakfast with no government roll

51
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
It's actually more complicated than you might

52
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:20,544
Trailer show freedom

53
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:26,944
We go to a place where we do as the founding fathers intended we buy food uninspected by any government agency

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,016
Using gold and silver mined from the Earth

55
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,808
And we get a nine-year-old

56
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:38,208
Who sold his alcohol

57
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,256

And the following message come from State Farm

61
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,800
Who's agents know that your car and home are more than just big purchases

62
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
They're a big part of your life

63
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,152
You put the time into making them your own

64
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
So now it's time to protect them

65
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,760
With your own personal State Farm agent

66
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
Not only do they truly get

67
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,112
But they'll be there for you when you need them

68
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
And with over 19008

Neighborhoods across the US

70
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
There could be one just around the corner

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096

73
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
State Farm

Here to help life

75
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Go right

76
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,264
So I arrived at this Festival in the middle of the night

77
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,312
And the next morning at 8:30

78
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
I came out to the campground

79
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,640
And I smelled freedom

80
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
Which actually smoke a lot like bacon

81
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
Oh yeah we're just picking this up

82
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Are you doing today

83
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
How much bacon do you have

84
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,928
I purchased a hundred 50 lb of bacon and I actually weave

85
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
90 of

86
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:48,608
And by we've I mean I made a 10-piece bacon weave pieces of bacon I weave into like a little blanket

87
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,472
About the size of a CD case that's a George bandra

88
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,824
And he set up a tent right in the middle of the campground where he sells bacon weed

89
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,616
And bacon weave omelette

90
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Vici

91
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,736
Yeah I know you have to pick this place Adam you would love it and not just for the bacon

92
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
Everyone has their little pants while they sleep

93
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Sleeper their RVs

94
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,368
Butt out front most people have set up

95
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
Some sort of stand

96
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
People where they sell

97
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
They sell precious metals gold silver

98
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Copper

99
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
This is

100
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,887
What they do in the forest rather than you don't just

101
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
Make s'mores around the campfire

102
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,191
Bay

103
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Participate in the market

104
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
By himself

105
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:27,775
And

106
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,615
You can't just fire somebody that you have to sort of brag that you are doing it

107
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
Without

108
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
The government so George tells me proudly

109
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
But he has no permit for his bacon

110
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,295
The kids Grill have never been inspected

111
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
The key will not pay taxes

112
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
They want their cut basically

113
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,695
Anyone take the intake part of my profit away from me

114
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
Are the fruits of my labor in

115
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
Hey you know they don't have any business

116
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,071
I don't want them in my business at all so I just

117
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
I just hate you know

118
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,935
If somebody wants to buy my food that's between me and then and then it's none of their business what I'm doing

119
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,311
We don't need to regulate George because will regulate him if he poisons may I won't buy his food

120
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,127
And he'll be done so

121
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Exactly

122
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
That was it, who was waiting in line for a bacon weave

123
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,063
And when he says he will take you out of the campground he means

124
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,159
He's got a gun in a holster on his belt with an XDM Springfield

125
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
I thought you told me

126
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,743
And you get the impression that no matter how tough

127
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
A New Hampshire food inspector is

128
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,071
He's not as tough as

129
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,143
What do you think about it is

130
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,447
It is really hard to get the government

131
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,287
Out of your breakfast or out of your life in anyway I mean

132
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,871
George might be in this immediate instance

133
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
Supporting permits in taxes but

134
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,711
You know he got eggs

135
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,063
Presumably the USDA is inspecting those eggs the USDA inspects

136
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
The bacon

137
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
Yeah you're just a little

138
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
Sheepish about

139
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:53,791
He says that often times he can get unregulated eggs but you know he's serving so many breakfast he had to

140
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
To buy them in a store and so the eggs of the bacon

141
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Are actually a

142
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
Proof by the government

143
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
At some point

144
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
And you can tell that

145
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,031
People give him a hard time give Aldi for the Train the hard time about

146
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,079
Driving on the Federal Highway is or

147
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
Search for buying things in a store

148
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,687
And it has a little speech that he says over and over again so slow

149
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,271
I am not a Hermit I do not live in the forest and avoid

150
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
All forms of Commerce

151
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
He's just trying to minimize the role

152
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
The federal government

153
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Sup French

154
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
To pay for the bacon weave omelette

155
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,743
George will take dollars US dollars

156
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
He prefers golden song

157
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,327
What are the most common is

158
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,935
Do they call junk silver which is pre-1964 dimes or quarters and also certain

159
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
Years of half dollars

160
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
All kinds of things like that we also take

161
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Bullion I've already had a

162
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
Somebody painting a gram of gold

163
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
And we just

164
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
Pretty much started a tablet counted as $50 and

165
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:49,087
We just own that money for the food so they would come by with a little less we kept track of

166
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
One gram of silver 5-gram silver

167
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
10.1 grams of gold

168
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
Wow that's cool

169
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,607
Well it's like a strand of gold how much is this worth

170
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
What are these ten bucks

171
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
$9

172
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
I heard it all day long

173
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
How much will the silver

174
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
What's the rate on Gold Member it is 8:30 in the morning there campers lineup for breakfast they have not had their coffee yet

175
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,991
And people are trying to do math in their head

176
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
It's about the price of gold and silver

177
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
But

178
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,159
Gold and silver in the last few years has been periods of intense volatility are they like

179
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,511
They got their iPhones out and they're checking the gold and silver price date Moment by moment

180
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
Yes they are I asked them this and they do another phone to do an internet connections there a little boards would have posted all over the camp

181
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
What the current prices of gold

182
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
And silver

183
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
And the weird thing is is

184
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
Although they hate

185
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
To a person

186
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,895
The Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Note

187
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
Which is what they call the US dollar

188
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
They do have to keep translating gold and silver prices

189
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,111
In the dollars people are constantly talking about how much for this and how much for that

190
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,391
And they speak in dollars

191
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:02,047
I want the most government free omelette I can get sound all you have are Federal Reserve notes

192
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
At that moment unfortunately that's what I get paid in

193
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
So I have to leave the breakfast line to go get some

194
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Silver now luckily

195
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,495
At this time in the morning there is a mini Bank

196
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,543
And he meant an actual men

197
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Set up on a folding table

198
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,151
Imma run Hellwig IMDb

199
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
I don't know if you would call it inventor designer whatever of the

200
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
Shire silver model

201
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,623
We're sort of the Federal Reserve chairman you're the Ben Bernanke of silver here in the camp

202
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
Well without the violence

203
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
Yeah he seems like it but you know he's

204
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
He's like the mafia Don

205
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
Who can you know

206
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
Talk reasonable but you know

207
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,799
If you go up against them odds are you're going to get hurt

208
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
You called

209
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,199
A super free-market libertarian Ben Bernanke

210
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
I know but I know that's a really dumb

211
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
That is

212
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:02,207
I think I've literally was insulting thing you cannot say you could have called him Stalin or even President Obama and it wouldn't have been quite

213
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
Is offensive to him

214
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,071
Turns out they do not think that the Federal Reserve is a subject for joke

215
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
I screwed up

216
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,911
I learned that you have to avoid the whole subject of the Fed

217
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:16,287
And I don't even ask him to elaborate on the whole violence thing because I need silver

218
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,591
I need coffee I need to buy my breakfast

219
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,175
So the thing about Ronnie is that he has invented

220
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,223
A very neat little version

221
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
I'm silver

222
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,271
That I want to buy from him

223
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
And you know how everyone Mox

224
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
The people who

225
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,647
Say that we should use gold and silver they say or what you do

226
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,743
Cherry red a bunch of coins in your pocket with your pants sagging down with all that gold

227
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Yeah

228
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
Got that little gold piece

229
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
State was

230
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,399
You don't like the size of a dime and that was 400

231
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,287
Something dollars so if we wanted like a penny or nickel what will we do with this shave off of Microsoft

232
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
Topix back I don't know how you use

233
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
Precious metals

234
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,407
Inundated they transact

235
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,711
Actually that is what Ron does

236
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,831
He basically shaves off small strips of metal he buys them from a jewelry supplier

237
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,159
And then laminate them he take the little tiny strips of metal

238
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,207
And he has an office laminator

239
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,815
Any mix something about the size of a credit card and I have one right here it is a

240
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
Little card is a shire silver

241
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
Laminated

242
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,423
And on the back what do you see there

243
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Oh wow yeah there's like a little

244
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,799
Tiny tiny tiny metal bar very very thin

245
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Shire silver

246
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
Defending Traditional Values

247
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
I paid a buck 94

248
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,247
Wow Buck 94 this all right

249
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,039
Actually you know this would work credits

250
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
It's almost more convenient than

251
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,879
Dollar bill with the first thing about it is it in Mississippi

252
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
Terry silver

253
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
In your wallet so I bought a bunch of

254
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
All right but

255
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
Let me know

256
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
I'm assuming you know about as much

257
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:47,423
About Silver's I do which means I have no idea how much this thin little bar is worth

258
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,239
It is I don't know

259
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:55,615
And it also is packed inside of this card which seems much heavier than the little bar silver so I can't really weigh it

260
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
To figure out how much it is so

261
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
You're just in the woods

262
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:03,039
In New Hampshire and you hand the guy a whole lot of money and he hands you a bunch of cards in

263
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
Claims that they're worth what they're worth

264
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,671
Yep and he said so you can go to a jeweler but once again we are

265
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
In the woods

266
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
New Hampshire

267
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,047
And so he says you know basically look you have to trust

268
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
Me on this

269
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
And this is weird

270
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
Sing

271
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Stop being a

272
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Campground

273
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
There's a tough guy

274
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
The caring guy

275
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
They don't trust the government

276
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
But they keep saying

277
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
You got to trust me we got to trust each other

278
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
In A N N I realize that

279
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,943
What are the services that government off

280
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,271
Is the luxury of not trusting one another

281
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
I mean that's why you have inspector

282
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
That's why you have police because you assumed that

283
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Somebody got to get

284
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
Get somebody's out there

285
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Poison your food

286
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,951
Or steal your stuff

287
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,511
But when you're the campground you kind of have to

288
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,047
To take people at their word so

289
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,607
I take my 10 grams of silver

290
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
And I head back to the almost

291
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
Coffee

292
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
And

293
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,055
Even there I'm trusting George is making my bacon weave omelette

294
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Did he wash his hands somewhere

295
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
At some point

296
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,175
I think this is exactly the point

297
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
All those government inspectors all of the symbols of trust in our society their false there fake

298
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
That you can't trust the restaurant

299
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
And so why not

300
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,183
Call it what it is

301
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:18,303
Is in force yourself to only trust people who deserve your trust rather than just believing in a government

302
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Probably let

303
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
For my case

304
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,423
Not thinking about it because I'm so hungry

305
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:28,799
So have a cup of coffee and a bacon weave omelette what's it going to cost in Timber five of those

306
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
30 bucks a piece

307
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,199
Roughly equal about diversity okay I have a 5 gram

308
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,783
Have a 5-gram silver card here

309
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
Died at $10

310
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
Right now

311
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
Excellent good deal thanks

312
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,951
I don't know if you noticed but I actually got a great

313
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,351
Big deal on that omelette they valued silver at a higher price than I bought it at 10 minutes later I made a profit

314
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
Blue outfits Tumblr

315
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
They can leave

316
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Made a profit but

317
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,263
It seems to me that if you don't have just

318
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
Irregular currency that everyone agrees that it's

319
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Turn off alarm

320
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Well I mean

321
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,967
Kind of the point of the porcupine petrol everything's a lot of work

322
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,503
You know you have to like

323
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
Track down who is selling what

324
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:15,903
And you have to figure out what they're taking some of them take silver and Grant some of them out

325
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,207
Until people are consciously trying to

326
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,255
Translate doesn't hide some people take goal

327
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,559
Some guy sold me copper who said that

328
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
It's Next Big Thing

329
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Yeah it's not the neck

330
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
But they're doing all of this to make

331
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,983
Appoint they say they want to be ready

332
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
If the Federal Reserve dollar

333
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
When

334
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,895
The Federal Reserve dollar goes under when it's not in paper money isn't worth anything anymore

335
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
They're going to know what the next currency

336
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Going to be something like

337
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
Xcel silver

338
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
If I thought it's illegal to

339
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
To print your own current

340
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
Are they allowed to ask

341
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Do that

342
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
Well

343
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,279
Verum any laws about this if you legal to mint coins that resemble us

344
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,911
But it's also illegal so I understand it to set up systems that compete

345
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
With official currency now what does that mean

346
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,055
You know there was one alternative currency called The Liberty Dollar

347
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
That

348
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
Some people felt was

349
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
Competitive with the dollar

350
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
Did they were using it the currency and that got a bunch of people arrest

351
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,575
Secret service around ready to pounce on

352
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
On your silver

353
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:20,415
Card manufacturer

354
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
You know if you press people

355
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,767
They will make it clear they say listen you're not

356
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Buying stuff

357
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
You are trading something of value

358
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Silver

359
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
Or something else of value

360
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Bacon weave omelette

361
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:36,031
And if you have a silver coin they don't called Silver

362
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
Coin is called a silver round

363
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
Because a coin

364
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
Really going to the government

365
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Quiet but a silver round is

366
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,735
Objective value that you can trade

367
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
But listen to this is this is all just semantics because

368
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
To tell you the truth

369
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,903
The people here are like breaking the law a lot of

370
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
BR proud

371
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,791
Of Smashing what they consider stupid laws so you can buy bootleg cigarettes

372
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
$4 a pack without all the

373
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,167
Taxes and they will proudly say I did not pay taxes on e-cigarette

374
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,055
Are there illegal bars without liquor licenses and they sell moonshine

375
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Marijuana trade

376
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
Listen

377
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,663
When it comes to Illegal moments my favorite

378
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Favorite

379
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
If this little hardened

380
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,015
I'm Dorothy and I'm 9 years old

381
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Dorothy

382
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
She was in the family tattoo

383
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
And they just had a lesson

384
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
For kids

385
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,767
About economics and Market realities but you basically it was like a little camper

386
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Libertarian

387
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,143
And the camp counselor was encouraging kids to sell whatever they can think of

388
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
Do the unsuspecting adults

389
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Walking by

390
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
Answer Dorothy had a single stack of

391
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,311
Woven they look like little potholder she called me

392
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Coasters

393
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,407
Willie walking out of bacon out of fabric

394
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
But they never seen their five in their beautiful and I

395
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
It's out I bought one

396
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
With soap

397
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
She was very

398
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
To get silver

399
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
So I would like the yellow

400
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
Coaster pot holder

401
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,207
Simpler and

402
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,743
He got his 1 gram of silver

403
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Thank you

404
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
You're welcome thank you

405
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,423
Oh yeah and we have a pothole to get a free bottle beer

406
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Free bottle of beer

407
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,335
You're about a bartender and a Craftsman

408
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
Pretty much

409
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
What kind of beer do you have

410
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
C4yourself

411
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
I actually don't know

412
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,439
You got beer from a nine year old girl was delicious

413
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
Criminal

414
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Utica

415
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
Contributing to the corruption of a minor

416
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:39,423
Yeah that that's probably right and listen I know it looks bad he went to

417
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
A state legislator and you said

418
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:45,567
You know I'd like to legalize children selling alcohol on little stands in for their home I mean

419
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,383
I mean politicians would freak out it would never happen

420
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
But I got to tell you so

421
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,807
This transaction seemed so innocent it was like buying a cup of lemonade from 11

422
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,111
Dorothy wasn't sneaking any of the

423
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,415
And her mom was right next to her the whole time

424
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
It's fine with us and

425
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:06,047
It's if an adult comes by and wants to have the beer

426
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
That's their choice if

427
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
Apparent comes by and

428
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
Seize the beer in

429
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,959
They don't want to participate in that that's their choice

430
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
As well

431
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,055
But your standards like if a six-year-old comes and wants to beer

432
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
I would not give beers with 6 year old know I would not

433
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,223
See they have standards and it brings it back to the whole trust thing

434
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,039
Every bootleg alcohol stand that I went to

435
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
Told me that they would not serve minors

436
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
He is

437
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
It's not because the government told them

438
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
But out of respect for the

439
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,279
The parents they didn't want parents come to them and say why did you serve my sick

440
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
16 year old

441
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Beer

442
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
I got to say this is an area where I

443
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
I have a lot of sympathy

444
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
We do have a lot of insane regulations

445
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,823
It is true there are a lot of nutty regulations and

446
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
Liquor

447
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Beer wine

448
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,711
This is an area where many of our regulations are nonsense

449
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
Neither states where you can only buy

450
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
Booze from

451
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
State

452
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Offices

453
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,903
Ancient be selling alcohol in the US you can

454
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
Buy wine in wine stores

455
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,975
Can't buy them in

456
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Supermarket

457
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,327
And no company can own several wine stores at once

458
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,631
Which grape inefficiencies in the marketplace

459
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
I think a lot of economy

460
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,959
C-diff not as

461
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:17,983
Helping

462
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,287
Protect our young children or anything it's just

463
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
Protecting

464
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
The interest of

465
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
Large wine distributors are large spirits

466
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,223
That's why I'm sympathy for them

467
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
Go out to the woods

468
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
New Hampshire I just

469
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
Buy wine at the Y

470
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Wine store in

471
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
But it does sound like you would fit in there and

472
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,999
This is why so many people that I talk to

473
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Out of the can

474
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
They talked

475
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
So proudly

476
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,655
About breaking the law they walk me through each and every

477
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,495
Gory detail of how they broke the law that gave me their full names

478
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
They basically daring

479
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
Law enforcement to drag them away

480
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
An initial reason for the

481
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Which is

482
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
They believe that if they disobey laws

483
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Which they feel are

484
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Stupid

485
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,039
They're going to be just like a guy

486
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Mike Fisher

487
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
The Rogue

488
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
Manicure

489
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
I know this guy is he Legend

490
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,743
Hear Emily porcupines in New Hampshire

491
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
In 2005

492
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,887
Mike Fisher had heard about all the regulations it takes to become a manicurist in New Hampshire

493
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
Just to do nails

494
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
And so he took action

495
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,031
In the campground I met a guy named Dave Minton who's a friend of mine

496
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,311
And he told the story

497
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,663
There was a group of us and kind of essay a civil protest

498
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
Kia called the

499
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,247
The board of

500
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,087
Manicurist or whatever their governing board is

501
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,647
He told me he was going to perform an illegal act

502
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,231
Anaconda the yard in front of their building

503
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,071
So we're outside the headquarters of the manicurist Association

504
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,351
Exactly

505
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,399
So what he did is he

506
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Trimmed

507
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
Another gal

508
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
It was with us now

509
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,311
So what do you have to fill nail clipper in a file or nah

510
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,895
Yeah she was sitting on the chair and then he was kneeling in front of her you don't need to

511
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
Just trimmed upper nails

512
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,247
And then they called in the authorities

513
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
And

514
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
They arrested

515
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,111
I think they actually took him away in a police car

516
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,207
So Mike Fisher

517
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,511
Play the guilty he took the case to court

518
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
He wanted to have his moment

519
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,119
To talk about manicurist laws and he

520
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
Did this became

521
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,703
A huge press story around the nation people covered

522
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
This crazy

523
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
Rogue manager

524
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,103
And an in the end infected in the last session of

525
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,687
The state legislature in New Hampshire there were number of bills introduced

526
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
Ginobili deregulate

527
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
Manicurist

528
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
But here's the list of things that they want to abolish license

529
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Barber

530
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:47,487
Tanning facilities Landscape Architects court reporters family mediators guides athletic trainers massage therapist Peddler's

531
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
And itinerant vendor

532
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,047
Looks like George

533
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,447
There is a big literature among Economist in the US about how often Licensing Laws

534
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,031
Just like liquor laws don't serve the general interest they just serve

535
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
A certain group of people allowing them

536
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
How to charge much more for their services be

537
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
Limit the number of people supplying them

538
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,015
End up hurting the general public which is supposedly the people were supposed to

539
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Be protected

540
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
By this

541
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:16,159
So is that their dream of one by one

542
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,744
Have these little Civil Disobedience moments and

543
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,840
And destroy the Regulatory and monetary apparatus

544
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,400
So the US government and eventually we'll all be

545
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,704
Effectively living in the woods of New Hampshire

546
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:35,616
Well I'm sure that's a dream for some of them remember something that these these little laws are silly and they want to get rid

547
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,688
Those people I talked to want to get rid of

548
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Ulta

549
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,504
They want to get rid of the school system

550
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
They believe people should homeschool

551
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
Private school

552
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,392
They want to get rid of most government services

553
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,744
Absolutely Healthcare Social Security all these things should be gone in their point of view

554
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,144
I think we should not intervene in foreign Wars we should only have a small defensive

555
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
To protect our

556
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,728
Boogie Nights is cute to say that

557
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
Yeah the manicure laws are silly

558
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,848
But these people have a serious goal I don't have a serious go to

559
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,408
Fundamentally change the United States of America

560
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
And a

561
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,016
If the campground porcupine Festival is any judge

562
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
It is going to be a difficult road because

563
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,368
Even the simplest things there

564
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,416
Are not quite working the way they should.

565
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,208
Remember that silver I bought

566
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,816
To buy my bacon with extra silver and so come dinnertime I heard about this

567
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Thai food

568
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,608
Restaurant like

569
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,912
Thai food 10th cross the camp

570
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,960
Other side of the campground

571
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:38,080
And I order a Thai burrito and I whip out my little silver cars the stars of a car

572
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
And the guy looks at him

573
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
I need the shakes

574
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:46,016
Syscoin guy back home oh take the silver rounds

575
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:50,880
What does old dimes the ones that you know before 1965 whatever were they when they were made of silver

576
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,952
And I've been standing at the guy behind me in line says

577
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,976
Well you know

578
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,024
I'll give you a dollar 10

579
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
Which of those strips of silver

580
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,912
But you made a dollar 90 that's all the sudden I feel like

581
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
A total

582
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Soccer

583
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
Now I'm the one asking where's the trust guys where's the

584
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
But you learned a valuable lesson

585
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
The iron

586
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:16,992
The market always has the last word

587
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:23,392
We'll have an update on the porcupine Freedom Festival of 2017

588
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:36,448
Support for NPR and the following message come from Exxon and Mobil the exclusive fuel partners of the plenti rewards

589
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
Words program

590
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,288
500 points is worth at least $5 in savings

591
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:45,664
You can pick up a plenti card at an Exxon or Mobil branded station and start earning points right away

592
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,224
To see how things are going at pork fest

593
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,552
These days 2017 I called up Matt Phillips

594
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,136
He's the president of the free state project they run Fork Fest

595
00:23:55,392 --> 00:24:00,256
When I reach them use one around the festival I can I can picture it in my mind cell service

596
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
Still not perfect

597
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
I'm down on the main

598
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,144
Field where I am

599
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,544
And a bunch of picnic tables and I'm actually just standing right near the bonfire

600
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:17,664
Message they have made some improvements importfest they now have Wi-Fi

601
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,200
Which they definitely didn't have when I was

602
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,272
That's cleared the way for this other big change

603
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
6 years ago

604
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
You would have seen a lot of people

605
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:25,856
Call Trading

606
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
Gold and silver

607
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,232
This year a lot of them most of them are taking

608
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,536
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies

609
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,096
If I look this up a hill there I can

610
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,912
Food truck that is a little doughy

611
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Pizza

612
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,960
They got really good feedback

613
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
She just had one

614
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,520
And right next to the menu

615
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:46,848
Have a little QR code that you can scan with your phone

616
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,432
And then send them Bitcoin in order to pay for your pizza

617
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,016
And not only are people using Bitcoin now to buy food

618
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,600
The food at the festival has a slightly different

619
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,184
There's still a bit of bacon but there's definitely

620
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,488
Places that are doing smoothies and

621
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,536
There's a vegan spot

622
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,096
Sounds like you're getting a little soft at Park Fest

623
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Well

624
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:16,032
You're part of the the thing that we're doing here is having the full mini experiment

625
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,592
If you got a free market and

626
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,920
People decide what they want

627
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
You Lie by

628
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:28,320
You know decide for themselves what their what's good for them

629
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,904
So pleased to hear that the libertarian the pork fest are being a little

630
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
More healthy

631
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:37,024
But is there still at least my favorite pork fest food

632
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,584
The food that I will forever associate with freedom

633
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,120
The bacon weave armor

634
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:46,240
I haven't seen the dumb and who's the who was doing that

635
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Ascena this year

636
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,288
But

637
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,104
If he comes back I'm sure he will settle the hospital

638
00:25:54,176 --> 00:26:00,320
Have you been to a fabulous fun outdoor festival or

639
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:05,184
State Fair or some other Gathering that teaches a fundamental principle of economics

640
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,256
