00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:32,256
To give $6

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,024
Donald Trump

Android the

15
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,840
The carousel he runs in Central Park

16
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
Which one you want which one

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,080
Tried on some clothing from the fine fine Trump collection

18
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,104
Beautiful ties

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,432
You should try the red one for this more presidential and I

20
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,968
Browse through the men's cologne

00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,320
Success cologne by Trump

00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,840
You can eat at the Trump Grill get that famous taco salad

Afterwards you can go to the Trump ice cream parlor we personally decided I different kind of dessert

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,336
The Sweet Sweet Sound of

25
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,640
The billionaire Martini at the Trump bar

26
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
None of this

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,784
Should come as a surprise to you we all know the Donald Trump owns a lot of stuff runs a lot of stuff

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,856
Profits off of a lot of people for his business

29
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,672
And you can feel uneasy about this it maybe

30
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,744
Unethical to be a sitting president make money off tourists

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
But isn't

32
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
Technically

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
But

34
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352
Up above us in Trump

35
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:45,984
Tower there is an office being rented out by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
Which of the bank owned by the government

37
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Which means

38
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
The Chinese government

39
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,152
Is paying rent to the president of the United States

40
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
And there was a group of lawyers who

41
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Who says that

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
That is not lie

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
In fact they are suing the president

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,832
They say he's violating something called

45
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
The emoluments clause

46
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,696
A couple lines written into the Constitution

47
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
Actually have a special

48
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
Competition reading voice

49
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,072
No title of nobility shall be granted

50
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
By the United

51
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
A no person

52
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
Holding any office

53
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
Prophet tour

54
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,216
Trust under them shall

55
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,520
Without the consent of Congress except

56
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
Any present

57
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
Emoluments

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Office

59
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,640
Or title of any kind

60
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
Whatever

61
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,968
For many King Prince reforms.

62
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,016
Emoluments means process

63
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
You can't profit from the office of the

64
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
And the reasoning behind this is

65
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
The president makes trade policy

66
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
He decides who are allies

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Who are enemies are

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
We don't want him influenced by other countries

69
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,608
So these lawyers who filed suit

70
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
They want him to divest from his businesses

71
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,568
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Noel King and I'm Robert Smith

72
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,664
We're going to talk about this lawsuit and this strange

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,432
Work

74
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
Emoluments

75
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,576
It goes back to something the founders were trying to determine 250 years ago

76
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,648
How do you keep a US president independent

77
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,208
And what's his relationship be to other country

78
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
It is a story that can only be told

79
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
With singing diplomats

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
Corrupt Roman

81
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
And a lot of lawyers weed lights

Everyday it feels like we are entering new territory

92
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
What President Donald Trump

93
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,736
But from the very beginning of the United States of America the writers of

94
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
The Constitution

95
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,576
We're dealing with this exact question

96
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,672
How do you limit the influence of foreign on our elected officials

97
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
There was this

98
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Really important test

99
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,631
It was a case that came up around the time they were writing the Constitution and it involves Benjamin

100
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,935
Who was Trump like in summer

101
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,239
Big personality.

102
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
Sonoran

103
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,799
When he walked into a room

104
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
He was the center

105
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,639
Of attention everyone was talking about Benjamin

106
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
Ben Franklin

107
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
What kind of guy are you

108
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
Write a Broadway musical

109
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:44,927
Call Mom

110
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,023
We have no tape of Benjamin Franklin but we have the next best thing

111
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Clapping

112
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,655
Weird Broadway musical from the 1960s

113
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Call Ben Franklin in Paris

114
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
It is no Hamilton

115
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
But it does help.

116
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,359
And the story is its October 1776

117
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,223
The United States is a brand new country the 13 colonies have just declared

118
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,807
And Benjamin Franklin is sent by the colonists on The Voice

119
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
Across the ocean

120
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,391
France to essentially be our ambassador

121
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,231
That's a terrible trip the weather is stormy the food is awful

122
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
And then

123
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Finally

124
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,839
Brooklyn smoke

125
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:29,471
Cooking smoked

126
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
Franklin learns to speak

127
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,311
French grammar is

128
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
Terrible she falls in love with an extension

129
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
Widow madame helvetius

130
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:41,759
Any plays up the whole Self Made American Frontiersman thing

131
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
He wears a plain brown suit

132
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,391
Instead of a powdered wig which is what the french your way he wears a fur cat

133
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
I made this get it wrapped

134
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,071
From behind of a grizzly bear

135
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
Siri

136
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
Franklin had this penthouse

137
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Love

138
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
And the French loved him

139
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
That is Zephyr

140
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
She's one of the lawyers suing present

141
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
Before that she was a book about

142
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
Corruption and the Cubs

143
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,271
The book starts with Ben Franklin and this

144
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,831
It's probably came up when he left France 9 years later

145
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,647
At the time there's a custom in much of you

146
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,207
When an Envoy goes home you give him a price

147
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,023
King Louis XVI gave Franklin age

148
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Serious

149
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Present

150
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,095
It was a portrait of himself

151
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
Peking

152
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,191
Illinois leasing consultant portrait that you hang up over your couch

153
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471

Tiny it's 2 and 1/2 by 2 in

155
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079

445 paint

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,991
You fit in the picture the king is wearing

159
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,807
Powdered wig she's a fat red cheeks and blue eyes

160
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,463
Is freely flowered collar this kind of interesting to write you know who gives you a portrait of themselves

161
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:01,375
This is a show of a kind of deeply intimate relationship over the painting isn't a big deal

162
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
It is

163
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
The setting

164
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
The portrait is

165
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,775
Set in a frame of two concentric rings

166
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Of diamond

167
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
Diamonds of

168
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
The highest water

169
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Karina this is surf

170
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
Incredibly beautiful diamonds

171
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
408

172
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Silence

173
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,855
Ben Franklin takes the portrait and the Diamonds back home

174
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,623
And Jefferson

175
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
Does people start whispering about it

176
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,231
They're like oh did you hear he got all these dope diamond

177
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
The king of France

178
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
I think about it the United States is a

179
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,607
Brand new country is in debt recovering from this

180
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
Devastating War

181
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
And everyone is

182
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
Terrified

183
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,495
They are now at the mercy of the world superpowers

184
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Like

185
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
France

186
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,359
And here is there man in Paris Walton back in with something is

187
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Worth more than

188
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
Just about anything else in the United States

189
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
So he asked the other sound

190
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
Can I keep these diamonds

191
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
MSA

192
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,879
It would probably be embarrassing if we made you return them

193
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,159
I'm so fine you can keep

194
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
But at the time they are ready Acosta

195
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
Didn't want to make this kind of thing happen

196
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,327
And so they write a clause in the Constitution

197
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,863
Institution making it very

198
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
You cannot accept gifts from a foreign leader

199
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
You cannot accept titles of nobility

200
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
And you can't take him all year

201
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
You can't make profits off of foreign government

202
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Without

203
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
The permission of Congress

204
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
And I will be totally honest with you

205
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,295
I had seen this in new stories but until today I have never said

206
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
This word out loud

207
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
Emolument

208
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Mario

209
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
And I imagine that even back when the Constitution was

210
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
Was written like this was not

211
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
A word you would use it

212
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
You would not go into a bar in meter

213
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Your friends f

214
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
A hard day of Amalia wing

215
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
And say

216
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
Emoluments

217
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,287
Guys this is a fancy Latin word

218
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,895
But the guys who wrote the Constitution were really into all things Latin

219
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
And there's a reason for that

220
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
You know they were writing a constant

221
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:57,599
Nutrition in looking around at other countries to use as blueprints for the kind of country that they want

222
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,391
Virtuous and decent

223
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,415
And Democratic

224
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
But this is a world of monarch

225
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,023
Define the Republic like the one they wanted

226
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,583
You had to go all the way back to ancient Rome

227
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
The founders were

228
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Really obsessed

229
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
With the late Roman Republic

230
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:19,359
This is historian Carl Richard he wrote Greeks and Romans bearing gifts about how Rome inspired the founding father

231
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
Yeah they copied wrong

232
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
They call the Senate the Senate like Rome

233
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
Repeat the eagle is the national bird fly Chrome

234
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,319
When I get in fights they write snippy letters back in

235
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Can 4th and the ultimate digs

236
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Is to call a guy

237
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
Cesar so Hamilton is writing that Jefferson is a

238
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,767
Caesar in Jefferson is writing the Hamilton is a Caesar

239
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,607
And they all pretty much agreed on both sides that Aaron Burr was he

240
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,191
Our Founders knew that roam

241
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Eventually

242
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
I fell apart

243
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,079
And it was vital for them that they figure out what killed the Roman

244
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,407
And so they were sort of doing autopsies

245
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,711
Nissan ancient Roman Republic

246
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
To see what is it what killed

247
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,575
You know this model that we're basing things on

248
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Corruption

249
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
That's what they decide is the big threat corruption

250
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:11,071
So when they're sitting in that room writing the Constitution yes they're talking about trade they're talkin about security but

251
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,631
Zephyr teachout says they keep coming back to

252
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
Corruption

253
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,727
The notebooks from the Constitutional Convention from

254
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
James Madison you'll see the word corrupt

255
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
Or corruption written in his

256
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,663
Longhand script 54 time

257
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
And yet

258
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,271
What I remember studying American history in high

259
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
It's cool I don't remember this

260
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Coming up an awful lot

261
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
The Monuments

262
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,463
No presidents and other elected officials have been so paranoid that they might

263
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
To be in violation of it

264
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
Did they do everything they can to avoid it

265
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,911
In fact in the handful of times it does come up it sounds ridiculous

266
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,983
Martin van Buren was given a shawl

267
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
Buy a foreign government

268
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
Really I said

269
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,895
Another horse

270
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
And

271
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
A sword

272
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,271
And Van Buren says I I can't accept

273
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,343
It's part of a it's a fundamental law of our Republic

274
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,183
Or if presidents are other us officials do except gif

275
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
They do what the Clause says they got to do

276
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
They asked Congress for permission

277
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,815
It doesn't come up very often

278
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
But when President Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace

279
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
Peace Prize which

280
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
1.4 million-dollar check

281
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
He did ask the justice department

282
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Can I keep

283
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
And they said yes

284
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,615
She could because it wasn't a government that gave him the

285
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
It was private money

286
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
And then Along Comes someone who can really

287
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
Test this part of the Constitution

288
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
President Donald

289
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
His entire being is prophet

290
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
He's a living in Monument

291
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,439
A president who ran on his

292
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
Is global business

293
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,279
I built a phenomenal business with

294
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
Incredible iconic acid

295
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,399
What Abby really truly great real estate business

296
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239
That some of his profits

297
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Duke

298
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,287
From foreign government

299
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
And that is what the lawsuit alleges

300
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
That money

301
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
Violate the emoluments

302
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
But here's where the confusion stop

303
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,503
No one's really pushed on this

304
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:10,367
No presidents been sued under the emoluments Clause until now

305
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
On the Monday after Trump was inaugurated

306
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,719
He didn't office about 70 hours

307
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
A team of lawyers files a suit says

308
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
You're violating the Constitution

309
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,095
That team includes

310
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,423
Zephyr teachout the law professor we heard from before we should also say

311
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
She's a Democrat

312
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
Who is running for office as a Democrat

313
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,775
It includes Richard painter

314
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,847
Who served as Chief ethics lawyer for George W bush

315
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
And Norm Eisen

316
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Who was Obama's

317
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,735
Their lawsuits has Trump is profiting in forward

318
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Let's do them number one rent

319
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
Like the Chinese government own bank paying rent

320
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Trump Tower

321
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,671
So you have a government of China in a position to make

322
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
The president of our country richer or poorer

323
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Through those lease

324
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
Negotiation

325
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
Number to foreign heads

326
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
State and foreign diplomats are

327
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
Staying at his hotels paying for hotel

328
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
Number three

329
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
Is television show The Apprentice

330
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,055
It is in countries like Britain and Vietnam

331
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
Where the television is state-owned

332
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
So at least

333
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
Indirectly

334
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Foreign governments are paying Donald

335
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,783
And number for the Trump organization does a lot of business over

336
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,855
In places like turkey and India and Indonesia

337
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
Does real estate deals require permit

338
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
And permits can be hard

339
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,279
To get infected a lot of these countries the permit process is not exact

340
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Ashley transparent

341
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
And this

342
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
Literally happened just

343
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
A couple days ago

344
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
The Chinese government granted

345
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,239
Preliminary approval for 38 trademarks linked

346
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,311
Two Donald Trump's name essentially giving him the right to

347
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,615
To use his name on things like

348
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,383
Spas

349
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
Massage parlors Gulf

350
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
Clubs hotels insurance

351
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
The list goes on and on this

352
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Is worth something

353
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
The Donald Trump

354
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,855
And again there is no proof that any of this

355
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
His made the president act in an unethical way

356
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,023
Or a corrupt way or that there was any exchange of favors between him and try

357
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
That though is not

358
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
The point

359
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,423
The point is the Constitution doesn't even seem to want us

360
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Have this

361
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
Discussion because it doesn't say in the Constitution you have to get something in return for an emolument it just says.

362
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
Take a mulligan

363
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
And this is the argument that

364
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:13,247
Zephyr and the team of lawyers want to make in court in a big question is

365
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,551
What is President Trump have to say about all this

366
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
I emailed the White House

367
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
I didn't hear back

368
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,439
But right before Trump took office he held a press conference

369
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
To address someone

370
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,559
He stood a table he was surrounded by piles and piles of manila folder

371
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,351
And he said look this is

372
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,679
I'm turning over Trump organization to my sons

373
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Even though

374
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
He does still own ever

375
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
Andy introduces lawyer Sheri Dillon

376
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,567
And she got right to it

377
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
On emoluments and info

378
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,407
No one would have thought

379
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
When the Constitution was written

380
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
Not paying your hotel bill

381
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
What's an emolument

382
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,087
She said when the founding fathers said emoluments

383
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
They were thinking about profits you make

384
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
Because you're the president

385
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
Not profits you make

386
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
Because you're a businessman selling something of value that people want

387
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,119
Until when someone pays a hotel bill

388
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,959
They're not paying President Trump who was inaugurated in January

389
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,287
They're paying businessman Trump who's been in business for decades

390
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
They're actually paying his

391
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
Organization

392
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,871
Which employs thousands of people

393
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
But even so Trump's lawyer said at the press conference

394
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,503
We're going to throw all you haters and Bone

395
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,063
President-elect Trump has decided

396
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
We are announcing today

397
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,647
That he is going to voluntarily donate

398
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
All Prophets

399
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,463
From foreign government payments

400
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
Made to his hotel

401
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
The United States Treasury

402
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
This way

403
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
It is the American people

404
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Who will profit

405
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
And that sounds good

406
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,287
But there is no Clause that says all profits made during one's time in office go to the treasure

407
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
It says

408
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
No

409
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,359
Prophets

410
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
Any present emolument office

411
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
What's the title of any kind,

412
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Whatever whatever

413
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
Like you just like I don't know

414
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
It sounds bad whatever whatever you come up with

415
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,623
Now in order for this lawsuit to

416
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
The lawyers still have to get it in

417
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
In a lawsuit like this you have to have something called Stand

418
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,535
Standing means

419
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,863
You need to prove you're being hurt by these alleged violations

420
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Constitute

421
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
So for instance

422
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
The Marriott Corp

423
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
Mary owns many hotels

424
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,775
DC area and they could say hey

425
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,567
All the diplomats want to stay at

426
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:18,175
Fancy Pants Trump Hotel man not staying at our hotel like they're actually materially hurt

427
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Yes

428
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Exactly

429
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
Except

430
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,295
It's not Marriott hotels that has filed a lawsuit

431
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
It's a bunch of lawyers

432
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Forester field psychic

433
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,439
Moral and ethical pain not just that

434
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,023
They say they do have standing they say they are being hard

435
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
They belong to a government watchdog

436
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
Monitor government ethics

437
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:43,007
We can't monitor the government at this point because all of our time and energy is

438
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
Is being spent

439
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,079
Watching the President of the United States

440
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,871
We can't do our job

441
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
So we're being hurt

442
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,991
I am not a liar but I am going to say that that sounds like a bit of a stir

443
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,575
I talked to some lawyers for this story who agree with you

444
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
They say yeah this is borderline

445
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
But I also talked to a law professor who's not part of the

446
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
And he says

447
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Winning it

448
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
Forcing the president to divest

449
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,327
That might not be

450
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
The point here

451
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,167
Maybe the point is to keep the heat on the president

452
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
Ben Franklin him ascend

453
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
Play to keep everyone talking about this

454
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Get to let him know

455
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,871
We're going to be watching and as far as your business deals over Caesar concerned

456
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
The founding fathers

457
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
Have got their eyes on you

458
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
We have one more part of the story after the break

459
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,159
Whatever happened to Ben Franklin's diamonds

460
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:36,767
Support for Planet Money and the following message come from ishares

Tell Robert

467
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,151
When I started reporting this story I kept asking people

468
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,271
Whatever happened to the portrait and the Diamonds that King Louis XVI gave Benjamin Franklin

469
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
Because you wanted to describe it and tell p

470
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,671
What this thing is like and no one seemed to know where they had gone but

471
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
I finally found them

472
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:10,559
You found them I found them at the American philosophical Society museum in Philadelphia

473
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
Do they have a little tiny room for that little tiny portrait

474
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
No it is not on display

475
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,983
At this point only the portrait is left

476
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
When Ben Franklin died

477
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,591
He will the picture and the Diamonds to his daughter Sarah

478
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Gesture for toothache

479
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,151
Please don't wear them in

480
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,943
Start a fancy jewelry trend

481
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
And please

482
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Don't sell them

483
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
Selena when she did

484
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
Oh she totally saw them

485
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,927
She started crying them off and selling them some money to take a trip to France

486
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,487
Got your Ben Franklin wanted that

487
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,095
You know at the end of the musical Ben Franklin in Paris

488
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
I don't think this music will ever be performed

489
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Okay

490
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,703
Franklin give the speech

491
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
And he says I wish I wouldn't die

492
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
I wish I could go to sleep

493
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
For 200 years

494
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
And then wake up

495
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,663
Stand once more on Pennsylvania lamb

496
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
And breathe the free air

497
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
I know in my heart somehow it will be free I know it

498
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
I know it even know

499
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
And I wonder

500
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
I wonder how I should find them then

501
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,655
Those Americans to whom the name American

502
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Will not be new

503
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
Will they love Liberty

504
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,615
Been giving it out right in the crib for nothing

505
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,223
And will they know that if you are not free

506
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
You are so lost without open

507
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
And will they

508
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
This Harvest of ideas

509
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,303
Be willing to strive to preserve them

510
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
As we so willingly
