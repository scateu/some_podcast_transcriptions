Monday around Thanksgiving of

16
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,264
Sil Turner noticed it

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,080
It seems like suddenly everybody was talking about

18
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,872
He thinks himself

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,432
I thought about that in Forever

20
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
I definitely used to have some of the

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,784
It's Amigos online

22
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
And holy crap

23
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,624
The price of Bitcoin

24
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
Was up to

25
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Hen

26
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,440

00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
Dollars

28
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744
Hey cell

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,768
Hey

30
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:10,144
It's 3 days later it's a Saturday still at his house outside of Atlanta and he's starting to get in

31
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,168
Because

32
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,240
The price of Bitcoin is now up to 11000

33
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Dollars

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
Still wants to find his Bitcoin

35
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,848
And he says there's like a chance

36
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,640
Maybe they're in his attic

37
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
On an old hard drive

38
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
In-N-Out

39
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
Computer

40
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,296
But I'm 900 miles away I can't get there to search

41
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,904
Testing 3 2 1

42
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:37,536
Who lives closer to self and ask her can you please drive over there as soon as possible and hopefully

43
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,352
We can record the moment sill Turner

44
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
Find a fortune

45
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
There's nothing to do right now

46
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
So

47
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,592
You want me to just go straight up to the Attic

48
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,176

Maybe one and a half

58
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
And they were worthless when he got them but

59
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Today

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,960

61
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
Alright so

Of all kinds of stuff

71
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,096

Exploded over the last year this has created the class of overnight Bitcoin millionaires

Stepped on something still digging through his Attic in Georgia

97
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
Frisbee

98
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,887
So is a software developer but like the rest of us he doesn't really understand how Bitcoin

99
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
You heard about it right when it launched in

100
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
In 2009

101
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
Figured I can't wait to have some of this stuff

102
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
It was worth pennies

103
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
He treated it like

104
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Loose change

105
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,407
Never kept track didn't really know how many

106
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,455
She had and then eventually

107
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
Let it fall between the

108
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
Virtual couch

109
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:43,135
Or whatever all right so I think it's one of these computers inside of computer up

110
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Is an old hard drive

111
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,207
With an old file

112
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
Call Bitcoin

113
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Coin wallet

114
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
That would give him access to his bit

115
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
What you would then sell immediately

116
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,399
Make something like $25,000

117
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
And then probably put that in

118
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
College fund

119
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
For his one-year-old son

120
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
We start taking these computers

121
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
I think we should take a hard drive out of this one anyway just

122
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
In case but I don't think

123
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
Pretty sure that is not the right hard drive

124
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
Pride open the second computer

125
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,831
Okay go go there is a hard drive

126
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Oh my goodness

127
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
Oh my God

128
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,951
Double chances are really

129
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
Did not expect to see hard drive

130
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
I'm here to be honest what did you think it happened

131
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
My thought was

132
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
I took the hard drive

133
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,447
Out of this one and I think I really do think it is this hard drive this one terabyte

134
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,775
Oh man I just actually really shocking to me

135
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
Because I actually did not think the

136
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,895
This hard drive is going to be in here I mean should we just checked should we just checked that one now

137
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
Yeah let's look at the

138
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
Seal head back downstairs with a hard drive

139
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,879
Baby wakes up hey buddy old hard drive

140
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,231
And so is worried that he erased this at some point and use it for video game

141
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
What

142
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
He's hoping

143
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,607
Searching for any sign of this wallet file

144
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
Alright so

145
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,935
I got to wear

146
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
I believe this

147
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Would be

148
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
There is a Bitcoin

149
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
Directory

150
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,359
In here where it should be

151
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,455
Or if it's in there

152
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
There's stuff in here

153
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
There's a wallet

154
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:19,391
There's a wallet and there's blocked okay I don't know what this means but I'm going to copy this out to my hard drive

155
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,439
Seals pretty shirt

156
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
And find out how much Bitcoin is on there

157
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,303
He explains that he needs to wait

158
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
Well another piece of software downloads

159
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
The entire history

160
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
Of every single Bitcoin transaction

161
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,239
In the world

162
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
Onto his home computer

163
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
It is going to take

164
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Hours

165
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
And unfortunately there's just no way to steam and Ike

166
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Stick around for that

167
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
But how are you feeling right now like okay so what I'm feeling right now is my my hands are very sweaty

168
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
I'm just kind of I'm kind of

169
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Amazing

170
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
They looking for the

171
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
Pennies in the couch cushions though that part of it I think I found it but it's encrusted with some kind of like I like I smell

172
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Beer in the couch

173
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,447
I like this thing is kind of stuck there and I don't know how to get

174
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,495
Get it off without ruining it yet

175
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:12,383
So I think what we should do like when it's ready I think you and your wife should

176
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,783
Just record yourselves figuring out how much is in there okay is that sounds good idea

177
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,159
So while still is waiting to learn his bit

178
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:29,023
I started to get curious about how many sill Turner's are out there in the

179
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
And the first thing that comes up when you search

180
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Locbit

181
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,143
Is the story

182
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
Of James Howells

183
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
It was the summer you were working through the stuff in your office and he found the hard drive why did you throw it out

184
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,639
I haven't used it for 3 years

185
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199
This is a BBC interview with

186
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
James

187
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,759
She threw away a hard drive

188
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,831
With 7 and 1/2 million dollars worth of

189
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
In fact this interview

190
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,183
Is at the landfill where he

191
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
He thinks the hard drive may have wound.

192
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
Yesterday they basically told me that anything that goes into the household scrap bin is compressed on

193
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
And buried by the way this interview

194
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,751
It's from 2013 a lot has happened since

195
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,639
More legitimate vendors start accepting Bitcoin Big Time investors started trading at

196
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,967
And as more and more people saw Bitcoin as a way to make money

197
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
The price has Skyrocket

198
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
Those bitcoin's James Howells lost

199
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,647
Are now worth more than a hundred million

200
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:33,791
James I'm sure there's an awful lot of people feeling for you right now how do you feel sticky

201
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
Absolutely devastated as you can imagine

202
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,679
I just wish I could go back in time and

203
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
I'm not so that joy joy

204
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Lost Bitcoin

205
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,311
Has been this legendary thing within the bit

206
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Community

207
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
It's also been kind of anecdote

208
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,431
I wanted to get a sense of the actual scale of

209
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,527
And of course there were Economist already on this Quest

210
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,367
Are you outside I guess I didn't ask if you either do our individual Bitcoin

211
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
A very small amount of

212
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,535
I was writing a paper in 2012 I think on bitcoin I bought a couple

213
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
Also very small amount but

214
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
So is it my turn

215
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,007
Nor did I take it seriously at any point until

216
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
About three way

217
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,103
Weeks ago this is Kimberly grauer and Jonathan Levine

218
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,967
Kimberly is senior Economist of a company called chainalysis Jonathan is a co-founder

219
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,759
The company makes software that can

220
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Can dissect Bitcoin transactions

221
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
Despot money laundering

222
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
Detect illicit Behavior but also just to learn about

223
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Bitcoin

224
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:38,815
What what do people actually say Bitcoin Bitcoins you can have Bitcoins on bitcoin is by the currency in

225
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
Okay

226
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,423
To understand how the James Howells and the sill Turner's of the world

227
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
Can lose or nearly low

228
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
Whois Bitcoin

229
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,543
We need to clear up a common misconception that

230
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
I totally did not understand either

231
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
There are no big

232
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
Which I know. Digital.

233
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
Real but no

234
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
No no

235
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
There are not even digital things

236
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,319
Been traded back and forth

237
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
With unique serial numbers are

238
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
That is not how the system

239
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Yeah yeah

240
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
So if I send you Bitcoins

241
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,047
I sent Bitcoin to your account on the Bitcoin blockchain

242
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Blockchain

243
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
Big word sherbet

244
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,703
Here is very non-technical way of understanding what it

245
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,519
Imagine with me if you will

246
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
A massive

247
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
Auditorium

248
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:22,847
Filled

249
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,383
With Bitcoin book

250
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,455
That Jonathan wants to send me one bit

251
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
She walks on stage

252
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
In front of all these bookkeeper

253
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
Step Up 2

254
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,647
And he's like

255
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,951
Hello entire Bitcoin universe

256
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
Is all of your book show

257
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
I Jonathan

258
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
Have 3 Bitcoins

259
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
To my name of course it would

260
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
Not be named Olivia

261
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,727
Anonymize account number I would like everyone here to know

262
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
Did I am giving

263
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,543
1 Bitcoin

264
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,895
To Kenny after Jonathan says this all of these virtual Ledger keeper

265
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,199
Scribble this transaction down

266
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,807
Duct one Bitcoin from Jonathan's account increase Kenny's account by one

267
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
And that

268
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
Is a Bitcoin transaction

269
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
Nothing is really transferred

270
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
It's more like an instantaneous

271
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Adjustment

272
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Across a whole bunch

273
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
When people talk about the blockchain

274
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
They're talking about this system

275
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
Weather is no Central Booking

276
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
And here's we're losing Bitcoin

277
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
It's interesting because

278
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
Bitcoin never disappears

279
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,871
All of those computers keeping all of those books

280
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:32,735
All show that my account now has one Bitcoin the one that Jonathan gay

281
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
However

282
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
If I lose the key to that account

283
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,647
There is no customer service line

284
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Call there's no

285
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
Bank I can plead

286
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,303
There's exactly one way into this virtual vault

287
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
And it is with

288
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,351
My private

289
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
What is a private key look like

290
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,007
I'm it's a string of letters and numbers that's pretty long a

291
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Can you give me an example

292
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:03,967
B987 3D 7c 6870 c0

293
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
B6

294
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,527
Aa5778

295
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,599
Skip 64 randomly

296
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
Generated numbers and letters this

297
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
Is on for a while 33262

298
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
Virtually impossible to remember

299
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,351
And if you lose this key and never find again

300
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,935
The Bitcoins inside your virtual Vault will sit there for

301
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
So when

302
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
We talked about lost Bitcoin

303
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
Coin what we really mean is

304
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
Eternally Frozen

305
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Bitcoin account

306
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Okay so now we know how

307
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
When transactions are

308
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,063
I recorded we know about the private key and how you can lose Bitcoin

309
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
The next big question

310
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
Is how much Bitcoin

311
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Is lost forever

312
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,351
Listen to up on my plate on my first day senior Economist at chainalysis

313
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,703
We are sitting around brainstorming some of the most interesting economic questions that we could tackle

314
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
And this was

315
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,031
Something that came up right away

316
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Bitcoin is not

317
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
Like other currency

318
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
There's no

319
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
Government that is going to just print more of it

320
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
The system was created so that

321
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,015
For the rest of time there will be a

322
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,039
Finite amount

323
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
We even know this number it's about

324
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,135
21 million Bitcoin

325
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,463
And people are now buying and selling Bitcoin

326
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,279
Because it has this scarce Resource Property

327
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,095
But we don't know exactly how scarce

328
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,679
Because some of those 21 million Bitcoins are already lost

329
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Forever

330
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471
In a garbage dump

331
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
So that's why Kimberly

332
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
Analysis and really anyone even thinking about

333
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,895
Bitcoin is interested in this question

334
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,223
Kimberly was able to work some fancy Analytics

335
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,575
And identify millions and millions of Bitcoins no one has touched

336
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
In a long time

337
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
Baidu.com

338
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,695
There are two main reasons those may have gone on to

339
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
The first

340
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
Is it maybe

341
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,047
The owners of those coins are just

342
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Really Savvy investors they

343
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:01,215
Why didn't early and they are still holding on waiting for the right time to sell

344
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,591
These are essentially if you're in the know in the Bitcoin Community they're called toddlers

345
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,127
Hodl

346
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,783
Earth it's an acronym for hold on for dear life hold on for dear life coins

347
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,879
That is an investment strategy where bottle is like

348
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
Early adopter

349
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,719
Going to believe the sky is the limit

350
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
Yes the coins you bought

351
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,119
For two cents are now worth $15,000 but

352
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,167
Hold on for dear life

353
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Because remember

354
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
You believe they could be worth

355
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
50 or even $100,000

356
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,871
So some percentage of those out of circulation coins

357
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
The Kimberly identified

358
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Are being

359
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
Hodl what is the other chunk then

360
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,759
Well I check if those are going to be lost

361
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
What do the name for those for those people

362
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,135
I don't have a name for those people I'm going to suggest

363
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Loser

364
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
Losers. Bad meme

365
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
What about ogwen

366
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Which stands for

367
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Oh God

368
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
Where is my Bitcoin

369
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Ogwen

370
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,191
Yeah it's not

371
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,031
That catchy of a word

372
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Toddler is not

373
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
I like it okay

374
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
We're all in the same picture

375
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
Yeah I did

376
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
Kimberly was able to estimate

377
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,479
Of that finite chunk of Bitcoin

378
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,295
Remember to only ever be 21 million of them

379
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
There is a

380
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
Painful amount

381
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
Locked away forever

382
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,975
Soda Springs AR grand total 2

383
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
Between

384
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,583
2.7 and 3.7 million lost Bitcoins

385
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,399
I feel like we should just let that sit for a second

386
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,495
At current prices that's more than 40

387
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,287
Billion dollars

388
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
A forever sunken

389
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
In on one hand

390
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,943
It shows the most obvious problem

391
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,991
With a ruthlessly decentralize money

392
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
There's no kitty

393
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
There's no option if you lose your private key

394
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
You lose your Bitcoin

395
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,487
In a centralized system in if you had a sack of u.s. dollars and they caught fire

396
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,791
The US government has an office that will

397
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,375
Look at your case maybe even give you a new money we did a whole episode

398
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
On the other hand

399
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,983
All of this lost Bitcoin illustrates

400
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,543
Something like paradoxical almost about

401
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
Think of it as it's a femoral thing

402
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,895
That can just disappear

403
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
But it's there forever

404
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:24,319
And no one's making new Bitcoin is only going to be 21 million estimated Bitcoin in

405
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
The history of the stuff

406
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
All of this lost Bitcoin

407
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Is reminder that

408
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
This

409
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
Is digital yes

410
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
And you could lose it easily yes

411
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
But it is truly

412
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
Is scarce

413
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Digital

414
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
Resource

415
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Whatever that mean

416
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
The other thing to note Kim says

417
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,847
Is it the vast majority of these lost coins were lost in the early years of Bitcoin

418
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
When the coins were essentially

419
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,431
Worthless

420
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
People going forward

421
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:57,599
Probably won't be losing at such a high rate probably most of the losing his

422
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
Already happened

423
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Because

424
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
Who cares about letting

425
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
A penny fall through the couch cushions

426
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,767
But if you happen to know that it's a

427
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,631
Very rare very expensive penny worth $17,000 you're probably going to

428
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Take better care of it

429
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Exactly

430
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,471
Even if Bitcoin goes back down to pennies

431
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,751
I think people will be more care

432
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
About their keys

433
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
Because I know one day

434
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
It could be this

435
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,175
All right so I believe

436
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,271
This is probably done this is a recording seal Turner eventually sent

437
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
So we can see what

438
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
How much Bitcoin is in this wallet

439
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:35,231
My baby is crying, he and his wife Jackie or sitting next

440
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,559
Computer sales got his digital wallet he's got his private

441
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,887
Keep and for the first time in nearly a decade

442
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,191
He is able to open up his

443
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Virtual Bitcoin fault

444
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Sigalert

445
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
Excited

446
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
Leaving is going to be

447
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Nothing

448
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
Alright let's see

449
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
Point

450
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
02

451
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
I think

452
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Oh wait

453
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,815
I sent .02 from this

454
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
To where

455
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
I don't know

456
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
What is

457
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,007
Dawning on sale

458
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
Is it he is Bitcoin

459
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Vault

460
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Is

461
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
Not only is it empty

462
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
He can check the history and he can see

463
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
The dis is

464
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Clearly the wrong

465
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
Account

466
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
She must have liked setup

467
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
A second account of test account

468
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:38,463
My friend must have transferred him a little bit coin and instill transferred it right back

469
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
I don't know how this works

470
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
This must be my other wallet

471
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,607
Oh man

472
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
She's continued

473
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,959
You know what to do now

474
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Alright well

475
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
This is where we're at right now

476
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
After the break

477
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,407
We get porcile Turner

478
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431

00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,487

484
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
So now it's time to protect

485
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,839

495
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Xidan

496
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,159
This is Kimberly and Jonathan from chainalysis

497
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
I got on the phone with them

498
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,535
And we called still turn case still yeah I've got

499
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,375
Jonathan and Kim on the line

500
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
Doing good

501
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
So we have gathered here today

502
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
To try and resurrect

503
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,519
Seals lost Bitcoin

504
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
And

505
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,127
I know we should say here that the chainalysis company does not want you to

506
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,663
Call them about your life

507
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
But

508
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
They are very smart and they're very kind

509
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
And they agreed

510
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,319
To hear porcile Turner story

511
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,111
And see if there was anything that can

512
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
Alright so

513
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,975
Probably 2009 or 2010 summer

514
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,303
So we tell them the whole story how he's been back into his attic

515
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,375
And there is not another hard drive is not another private

516
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
Keep a keen nose

517
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,215
There is another account with Bitcoins in it

518
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,751
So that's where I'm at

519
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Okay

520
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:31,871
Yeah boy it's a real shame to hear but it wasn't the right hard drive

521
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
Unfortunately

522
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,759
Well we need to find the needle in the haystack is even like

523
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,039
A little bit of the

524
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Chucky

525
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,391
What Jonathan is saying is the Bitcoin private keys

526
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
Are designed to be unguessable

527
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,975
Even by the most powerful

528
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
Computers that we have right

529
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,119
It still happened to write down part of his key at some point

530
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,935
There companies that will use that information

531
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
To help still

532
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
Break into his own account

533
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,567
The charge him a fee or ask for some of his Bitcoin

534
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,359
Stellar Bitcoin Bounty Hunter

But

538
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
You have to have some

539
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759

What kind of things do you say to somebody in Sims position

547
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
People that have

00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,984
Lost Debit coins I say
