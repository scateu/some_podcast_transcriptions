00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,360
And we trying to see how it's playing out in some other corner of the world maybe get a

60
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Perspective shift

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,248
In this case Ukraine is actually the place where some of Russia's fake news tactics were first

62
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
Developed tested

63
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296

The way I would like the whole country leave

116

Talking to each other discussing issues discussing problems

119
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
The reason I went to Ukraine back in 2014 was because the country just had approached

120
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
Democracy Revolution

121
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,103
Protesters in the capitol

Russia

00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
Russia opposed this Uprising it wanted Ukraine

00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535

126
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
It's much cheaper.

127
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
But when the protesters succeeded and the

128
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Pro-russian president

129
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,239
Flat respond realize that Russia was fighting back

130
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,055

131
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,639
Russian tanks

From fascist in Kiev

142
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
But they want a fascist

143
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,895
Respond could look at his window and see the streets were peaceful

144
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
Barricades on the Square in Kiev

145
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
Covered with fresh flowers

146
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,783
But ukrainians who are not in

147
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Got scared

148
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,647
So while respond would watch these stories and think

149
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
Some some b*******

150
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
In other parts of the country

151
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
Free people started standing guard

152
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Ukrainians in Crimea

153
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Rose up

154
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
They rejected the regular

155
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
They want to be but everybody everyone is Russia and

156
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,871
The Grammy Awards Russian before protesters

157
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
In Crimea

158
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,455
Quoted the Russian TV stories about fascist

159
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
Big Russian troops to save them

160
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,599
Kind of feeling that the new government in Kiev is

161
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,183
Hostile to Russian speakers and ethnic Russians here

162
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
Russian troops arrived

163
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
And Crimea voted to secede

164
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:33,887
Ukraine wanted to fight back in a solution that came up with was a news blockade

165
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,751
A complete ban on Russian news channel 5 has a game stat decision

166
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,567
I was in favor of

167
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,383
Esmarch sources of information is possible

168
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
Ukraine the band media

169
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
This is not democratic

170
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:54,111
But that was the Ukraine that the Revolution fought for Ukraine if you want to be a democracy should allow

171
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,207
How to have another opinion and Western diplomats agreed this is censorship

172
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,839
The government back down

173
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Free speech

174
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Democracy

175
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,191
And respond came up with a radical new plan

176
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
To fight back

177
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,287
A team of top journalist would fact-check Russian news

178
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
And broadcaster

179
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
The results

180
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
And the time

181
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
That's a really scary

182
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
To me it actually meant that I'm

183
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
Kind of putting my life on the line

184
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,575
This is Marco Gonzales she was tapped to host a show that would

185
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
Debunk Russian fake

186
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
It so it would be her face on the screen.

187
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,463
Any Kremlin agents might

188
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
Knees shaking

189
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,143
I need shaking for half an hour what did you tell yourself before you went on the first time

190
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
I'm doing this

191
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Because

192
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
I think this is

193
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
What should be done

194
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
And

195
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
I

196
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,663
Like I'm coping with all the consequences it can bring with it

197
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,735
It was actually kind of the first moment

198
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
I

199
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,855
Really felt connection with would like my people you can say

200
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
The name of this new show

201
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
It even sounded like a

202
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,487
Journalist superhero

203
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,583
Show scope stop fake

204
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,143
It's a Roundup of all the false stories you might have missed that we

205
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
Welcome to stop fake

206
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:18,079
There's also an English version of the broadcast

207
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:24,479
Ballet dancer Sergei polunin is a not sending food riots in Russian

208
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
Included nasal septum

209
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,111
Sphincters stopped 18 woodtrace how false quotes were shared

210
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
From Outlet to outlet

211
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:37,791
Videos to show where the vial of fake blood might be hiding publish the story with this misleading headlines

212
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,631
I'm here many of the stories saying is poised to enact a new language law

213
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:48,031
Which will ban Russian and Russian speakers being persecuted in Ukraine only Ukrainian cafes and shops in it

214
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,103
Pending legislation on the Ukrainian language

215
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
To understand what was going on

216
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
On here it helps to think

217
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Ukraine is kind of

218
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
2u grants

219
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
East and west

220
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,367
The East borders Russia got more Russian speakers

221
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
The West borders Europe

222
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
That's more Ukrainian speaker

223
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,231
And east and west different

224
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
Ethnicities there more like cultural group

225
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
But there has been friction in

226
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
The past

227
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,935
Responses it was easy for Russian news to insert itself into this divided they want

228
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,215
One part of

229
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
The country russian-speaking

230
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
To hate another bottle

231
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
The country ukrainian-speaking

232
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,175
Scented water to the pool shell

233
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
This was one of the stories on Russian tea

234
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,295
It reported that Ukrainian soldiers had

235
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,575
Seize the Russian speak

236
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Toddler

237
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
Ritually stabbed him in the nail them to a plank of wood

238
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
A literal person

239
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:41,791
Evil tattoos in the mom in the closer mom will dish of it

240
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
It looked into the story

241
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
There were no other Witnesses

242
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
This crucifixion supposedly happened in front of the

243
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Huge crowd

244
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
Stop fake also found

245
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,711
Extremely similar phrasing in the Facebook post of a Russian extremist

246
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Published three days

247
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
Before the TV channel

248
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Reported it

249
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:09,695
And a few months before that a very similar crucifixion scene playing out in a show that is very popular in Russia

250
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:15,583
Game of Thrones

251
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
That's it for this week

252
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
Doing fake news is bad for your health

253
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Your brain

254
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
And a psychological climate of society

255
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:30,175
The first stop taking success beyond what responded even imagine

256
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
The debug stories were hit on social media and

257
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
And other news outlets picked up their stories

258
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
More than that

259
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,647
Stop pit crew volunteers felt like they were winning the war

260
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
The war

261
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
And then

262
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,631
The real working the situation in eastern Ukraine seems to be getting worse separatist malicious or rising up

263
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,215
And all kinds of Eastern City Line wasn't strong enough

264
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,287
Came under heavy attack to rejecting the government of Kiev

265
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
Declaring allegiance to Moscow

266
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Getting help from Russia

267
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
This morning gunman in camouflage fatigues

268
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,735
Respondus watching his country split into

269
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
Wondering what did I miss

270
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,599
What more could he have done

271
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,927
The clue came one sleepless night after watching all this morning

272
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Outback

273
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
One of the stories idiot

274
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
Debunked months before

275
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
It was a little story

276
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,167
Russian media claimed that thousands of ukrainians were fleeing over the border to Russia

277
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,471
This was back before the war started when

278
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Ukraine with peaceful

279
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,359
Yeah so I called the federal migration service of Russia

280
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
He take the phone call. Big asked

281
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
The the person from from

282
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,295
Federal immigration service if it's true or not

283
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,743
Was it true that even though there was no war no violence in

284
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:52,863
Crane the thousands of people in the East were abandoning their homes for Refugee status in

285
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
She told me

286
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
No this is not true

287
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
We we have just

288
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Several phone calls

289
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Sender

290
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Oh yeah we have nothing unusual

291
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
Thousands of ukrainians

292
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
We're not

293
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
Cleaning to Russia

294
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,967
Why would that right I mean

295
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
Ukraine is totally piece

296
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
Except respond did not hang up

297
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
He kept talking to this Russian official

298
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,999
And what she told him next he would not realize the significance of until months later

299
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Months later when War

300
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
Had competition

301
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,863
And thousands of people were fleeing their home

302
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
It was

303
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,751
Several months later in the middle of the night when I remember that

304
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
Phone conversation Island

305
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
I went to my computer

306
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,359
And I

307
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,479
Cindy's conversation again and Bam it was

308
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
Kind of

309
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
Thunderstrike to my head

310
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,671
What she told him was that yes there were no refugees right now

311
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
But she told me that

312
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:55,583
We have received an order from Moscow to prepare places for refugees

313
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,703
So they will know refugees but they've starting preparation process for refugees

314
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,287
Responded that the news was not true actually

315
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,151
It just wasn't true yet yes sometimes they just preparing you

316
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
Four events that

317
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Still

318
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Not happen

319
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
This seemed like something a lot weirder

320
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
And a lot more dangerous

321
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,463
Before he known the fake news could Inspire fear and distrust

322
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
But now it seems

323
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
To be planting ideas in people's heads

324
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,887
And for her son this little moment on the phone with Russian official

325
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
It felt like he accidentally

326
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,471
I pulled back the curtain on the stage set

327
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Before it was done

328
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,055
To know when I saw something

329
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
Russian television

330
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,175
I usually ask myself what might be their plan

331
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,807
Respond started to doubt the truth alone could win this war

332
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,903
Especially if today is fake news could become tomorrow's reality

333
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,487
When rough translation returns we're going to go east

334
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
To the place where the information War

335
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
And the real war

336
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607

Ukrainian Army checkpoint

If you imagine Texas which is about the same size as you

351
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,559
Imagine a piece of Texas pledge allegiance to Mexico and started trading in pesos

352
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
There is now a line that's

353
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,679
Dividing eastern Ukraine and on one side of that line are separatists

354
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,471
Who reject the government in Kiev

355
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Get help from Moscow

356
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,567
This side of the line is controlled by Ukrainian government true

357
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,991
I am the 500 miles east of Kiev 500 miles from responds Picket Fences and his Lexington Ave

00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,071
I'm out here to follow up on that odd thing that respond told me

374
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,863
That how today's fake news

375
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,167
Me tell you what really happened tomorrow

376
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,239
It all the folks I'm eating a vehicle it feels like

377
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,591
Alexander the sky show me run as backyard is the most likely to have an answer

378
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,199
Because he is this town only newspaper seller

379
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,551
I met him earlier that morning in a market at the center of town

380
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,135
In his corrugated metal Shack filled with newspapers

381
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,999
It's a market where you see if locals mixing with soldiers and their green uniforms buying provisions

382
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Army trucks are rolling by

383
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,143
Alexander Scott laffline all of his face including

384
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,679
Front of ears like sideburns

385
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
Everyone seems to know him

386
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
I'm just calling Uncle Sasha

387
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,919
They come here to ribbon with jokes

388
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,063
And to discuss the news discuss the news with people

389
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
Carne asada

390
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Yes course

391
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,487
Wishing on Forgiatos nuts

392
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
Cochrane review

393
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,863
He says they very much want to know what's going on

394
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
How ukrainians live

395
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
That means a lot

396
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
You know we don't want to be cut off in the country

397
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
Which makes what he tells me next

398
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
So odd

399
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,711
He reads the news all the time but when he sees a journalist coming around

400
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
You get scared

401
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,319
Narcissistic

402
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,903
If the television crew show up that's when the shelling begin

403
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,463
I don't get it though what that means

404
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,023
The journal is coming in they start selling Li

405
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:47,167
Mass Effect 3 that's why our relationship with the Press is very

406
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
10cc

407
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
When he sees a TV crew

408
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,055
He says they try to leave immediately because

409
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,871
They start to Shell in exactly that place

410
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Gregory

411
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
A little later different part of town

412
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,831
The two other guys waving me away as soon as I approached my interpreter

413
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,135
Let me introduce ourselves as journalist

414
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
Alex please

415
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:14,559
Don't come to the spot

416
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
I'm not I didn't do the Shelly

417
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
You can hear it I've still treating this like a joke

418
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,703
I just don't get

419
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Then

420
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:27,103
A few minutes later when those guys have left I'm standing on the same street corner with my interpreter and son

421
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,943
Sis you know you know everybody like strong Leviticus

422
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,503
Every time you arrived

423
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Massage kind of dogs

424
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,183
Every town on the front lines will be will be a doctor because

425
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
When journalists arrived was a boss.

426
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,095
When journalists arrive the war starts

427
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
I couldn't put this out of my mind

428
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:59,615
Because it means the people here believe that this war is being fought mainly so that someone else can watch it on TV

429
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:03,455
Like a reality show War but with real bullets

430
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,271
And Alexander is one of the unwilling extras

431
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,623
Alexander even told me

432
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
We already know in advance it's a show

433
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
And we don't like it

434
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,631
There's actually an old Russian joke

435
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,751
In America you do X but in Russia

436
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,567
Xsu example in America

437
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,127
You can always find a party in Russia the party fight

438
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
In America

439
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,527
You break the law in Russia the law breaks you there's so many versions of this joke

440
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,063
Actually has a name

441
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
The Russian reversal

442
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:46,719
And listening to the people in a vehicle I felt like I'd walked into the middle of that joke

443
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,887
I came to see how people watched the news and they're telling me no here on the frontlines the news watches you

444
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:02,079
Back in Kiev

445
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
Unresponsive patio

446
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,455
Is chopping wood with this little acts like Ukrainian Village Meats

447
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
Suburban

448
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,087
Firing up the grill first family favorite Sunday meal cheeseburger

449
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,159
I want to ask Christian to make sense

450
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
But I'd heard in the front lines

451
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
About this being

452
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
Some kind of reality show War

453
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,328
But before I can even bring it up he wants to show me something

454
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,632
He leads me through living room

455
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,936
Is this kid playing on the floor

456
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,984
What is a separatist TV channel

457
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,104
On the screen is a guy in camouflage fatigues he's one of the Ukrainian separatists smooth

458
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
Cleared Independence

459
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:36,896
Tokyo

460
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,224
The press conference is actually taking place on the other side of that Frontline

461
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
But respond is not

462
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,808
Apparently interested in what that guy say

463
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
The channels on mute

464
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,696
He directs my attention down to the bottom of the screen where are the microphones are made on the podium

465
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,768
He's counting the Russian Mike's

466
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
When you see one or two mics

467
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,608
This a local

468
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
TV channels

469
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
It's okay

470
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
But when you see

471
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
10 Mikes from Russian TV Naruto

472
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,056
It means they're going to to do something

473
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
It is a shalling

474
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
Or

475
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
Some

476
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
Kind of events that might be Danger

477
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,784
See other people in a few can know that because when I came

478
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,112
They said we don't like you journalists cuz when you journalists come

479
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
It yeah

480
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,928
So I think local people

481
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
They have not

482
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,024
Is this correlation

483
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,072
There's this one

484
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,680
Really unnerving difference between his theory and the one that I heard out the front line

485
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
Respond

486
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
The Russian might say you have to watch out for

487
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,312
They're there to make Ukraine look bad

488
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
But for Alexander

489
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,944
It's the Ukrainian Mike's aiming to make Russia look like the bad guy

490
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
Which is

491
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,040
Improbable but almost impossible to fact-check

492
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
In the fog of War

493
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,904
The perception that it is true though is almost scary

494
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,464
Both respond and Alexander believe

495
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
The journalist are in

496
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Foods with their government

497
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,072
Fighting the information War

498
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Alongside

499
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
The real one

500
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
And if you believe that

501
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,728
You can just ignore any piece of news you don't agree with

502
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,032
Just chalk it up to enemy strategy

503
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:16,736
Back in Kiev respond decided that the Russian media

504
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,504
Was the

505
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
In fact checking with not going to save you

506
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
So

507
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
Then we realized that

508
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,672
We need to protect

509
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Not just

510
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
Our profession but

511
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,792
To protect the whole country because it was

512
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,888
A question of survival for food for Ukraine

513
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,192
Empress and the only option left

514
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:39,008
What's the one that he'd once begged the Ukrainian government not to do

515
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
Censor the Russian news

516
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,848
I change my mind

517
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Dramatically

518
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:51,296
I was hundred percent sure I was damn sure that we need to cut it right away

519
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
Stoptech handle

520
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,488
It's Archive of Russian propaganda techniques to the Ukrainian government

521
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,536
Which probably used it as evidence

522
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
If we

523
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Did it

524
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
Earlier

525
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
I think

526
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
We might

527
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
Avoid

528
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
A lot of

529
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Deaths

530
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,336
Rahsaan believes this band did stop the front line from moving further west

531
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,408
It prevented more Ukrainian cities from falling under separatist

532
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,176
Control

533
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,992
It also opened his mind

534
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
To the power center

535
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,368
Watching TV one day with the three-year-old

536
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
You're the host at this Russian kid show

537
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,208
Praising Vladimir Putin

538
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,744
For protecting Ukraine

539
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,328
Respond sent an angry tweet and that shows pulled off the air

540
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,192
And then also cut where Russian talk to us soap operas

541
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,752
A wildlife Channel hunting and fishing show

542
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
And respond to $10

543
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
I'm not sure if

544
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
We Hunted

545
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,664
Percent protected right now but at least we are

546
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Moving

547
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
In these

548
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,016
In the right direction to protect ourselves

549
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
Ukraine

550
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
Then took this direction

551
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Further

552
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,648
Ukrainian hacker group

553
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:04,000
Types of the government published a list of every journalist to cross that front-line to interview

554
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
Do people on the other side

555
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,584
Thousands of journalists were on this list

556
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
Pudding

557
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,656
International journalist from NPR

558
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,680
From The New York Times

559
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,984
The title of this list was simply

560
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
Scoundrels

561
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,664
Ukrainian lawmaker called them terrorists collaborators simply because they just gone over to the separatists out of the line

562
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Interview people

563
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,272
Respond did not see any problem with the list

564
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Why not

565
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,440
I think what they do is is useful

566
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
Publishing

567
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,744
Names

568
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,048
Email sender

569
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
Personal information of

570
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
Reporters

571
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
It might be okay

572
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,216
But labeling them

573
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
Enemies

574
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
It was

575
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
It was stupid

576
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,920
Wasn't worse than stupid though I mean

577
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,688
Seems

578
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
Pretty

579
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Intimidating

580
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,760
Journalist

581
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
Yes

582
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
Naming them

583
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,624
Traitorous

584
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
That was

585
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
Knox

586
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Right

587
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,536
Sometimes it's not very easy to

588
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,560
To tell

589
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
Be up to be just

590
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
Straightforward enter

591
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Nutria

592
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Yeah

593
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,568
We want this country

594
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
2xist

595
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,168
There are costs to fighting the information War

596
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
The obvious one of these start

597
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
To adopt the tactics of your enemy

598
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:57,152
Today's comedy or critic of Ukrainian government tagged a Kremlin agent Virginia term for someone who's an

599
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:02,016
Agent without actually getting money or direction from Russia they're called an unwitting agent

600
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:05,344
Crescendo talks about a different cost

601
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,160
Spending so much of his time fact-checking fakes

602
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,232
You got no time to write stories about Ukrainian two are making

603
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
Despite their differences

604
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:18,400
The sort of story that he imagined himself writing when he first moved to that house with the picket fence

605
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
Stories that Inspire other people

606
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
This

607
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
This inspires

608
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
This is true drone journalism

609
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,896
How to check somebody's lies into

610
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,224
Keep somebody accountable I cannot tell that

611
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,552
I'd be happy to do it all my life

612
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
Crate

613
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,440
I'm afraid that Russian distance 8 +

614
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,768
They do their best to

615
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
To make

616
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,584
Us enemies forever

617
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
And

618
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:52,448
At the end of the day it will be very difficult to see.

619
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,008
The table and talk like

620
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
Like France

621
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:07,552
Blah blah blah

622
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:25,216

626
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
Something that has been globalized
