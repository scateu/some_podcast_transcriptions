00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,224
The 1970s

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,272
Where this very weird moment

14
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,552
Find an American economic

15
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,112
Industries were dying

16
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
It was an oil embargo

17
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,720
And by the end of the decade inflation was out of control

18
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:35,072
I kind of live through it and I totally remember the price of comic books going up

19
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,352
Like every month

20
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,144
I collected them for a few years and

21
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,240
I was paying $0.25 at the start and like a dollar twenty-five when I just gave up

22
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,288
And a little inflation

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
Is actually good for the economy

24
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
Army to 3%

25
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,688
But by 1980 inflation was at thirteen percent

26
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
Was making America

27
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
Crazy like

28
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
How do you decide whether to buy a new house or make a new Factory

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
If you don't know how much

30
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
Dollars going to be worth

31
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
A year from now

32
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,208
What's really interesting about ammoman

33
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,560
Like that is that the inflation is caused by all these different parts of the economy

34
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:11,680
But the power to do anything about it basically rests with one Institution

35
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
Federal Reserve Bank

36
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
America Central Bank

37
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,080
The bank that basically set interest rates

38
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,872
All of the other banks in the country

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
In 1979

40
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,968
The FED got a new chairman

41
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,760
Six foot seven

42
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,040
Cigar-chomping economy

43
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
Paul volcker

44
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
Volker new

45
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,928
There was one Surefire way to bring down in

46
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
Raise interest

47
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,280
Where are you

48
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,352
Exercises to improve.

49
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
Conditions in the long run

50
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,216
Volkers exercise was Raising interest rates to

51
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
Crazy level

52
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,032
20% of 20%

53
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,824
I guess it's something like that

54
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,128
Operation is not much fun

55
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
But in terms of if you got something the matter you better have the operation

56
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,112
High interest rates would make it expensive to borrow money

57
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,160
Consumers wouldn't spend as much

58
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
Businesses would invest as much

59
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,488
The economy with

60
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,512
Cool down

61
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,072
And of course it's the same idea Works in Reverse to

62
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,864
The FED lowers interest rates

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
Borrowings easier so

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,448
People and companies will spend and invest more in

65
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
Inflation goes up

66
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,312
Raise interest rates inflation goes down lower interest rates

67
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
Inflation goes up

68
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
If you're a central Banker that interest

69
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
It's it's kind of all you got

70
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
At least historically like

71
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Boker

72
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,552
Is a very powerful tool

73
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
Invoker

74
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,624
Crank up interest rates to 20%

75
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
Can you change the entire economy

76
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,488
By 1983 inflation was down

77
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,304
Want to just about 3% millions of people's lives

78
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
Change

79
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
How many jobs there were

80
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
What you got paid

81
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
What stuff cost at the store all of it

82
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,216
Basically

83
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Because Volker

84
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
Decided it should

85
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
But that trillion-dollar lever that is the single tool that Central Bankers can use to completely remake the Econo

86
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
It's not working the same way it used to and people really don't know why hello

87
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,672
Welcome to Planet Money on Bryant and I'm Keith Romer

88
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,208
Today on the show

89
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,768
We try to get to the bottom of this mystery

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,840
What has changed is Paul volcker time

91
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,168
It is making me interest rate lever act so strangely

92
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,496
It's a super nerdy macroeconomic question

93
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
But it is also equipped

94
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
It gets to the heart

95
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,872
How much things cost at the grocery store

96
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
How much money you take home in your paycheck

97
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,528
To answer this central question we go to the Center of Central Banking

98
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
Annual meeting in

99
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
In Jackson Hole Wyoming

100
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,184
Where the world's most powerful lever pullers are trying to figure out

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,976
What the hell is going on

102
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Going

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
To the central bank is cover

104

We should explain

119
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
Why the central bank

120
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
His conference is in Wyoming

121
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
Back in 1982

122
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,567
The organizers were trying to figure out

123
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,871
Where to get a hold of meeting that would attract

124
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
The big name in Central Bank

125
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Paul Walker

126
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,527
And the only thing that balker love more than fighting inflation

127
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
And cigars I guess was fly fish

128
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,647
And apparently at the end of the summer Jackson Hole

129
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Is the place

130
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Bass Pro fly fish

131
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,231
So they put the conference there

132
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Bokeh couldn't resist

133
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
He showed up

134
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
And even though he hasn't been there for years

135
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,631
Everyone's still goes out to Jackson Hole

136
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,703
So we sit around all day obsessing over wage stagnation

137
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
In the natural rate of on

138
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,543
Unemployment in the money supply so the chance to go to a central

139
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
Bankers conference

140
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,127
Who's like nerd fantasy can't we were totally in

141
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Jackson Hole local * 1159 would like to thank

142
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,879
Thank you for flying with us today we hope you have a pleasant experience

143
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
It was such a pleasant experience it is gorgeous there and it's about a 45-minute drive through just beautiful

144
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,679
Straight to the conference it's a 45-minute drive if you don't stop every two miles

145
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
What about lunch it's just a Cunningham cabin

146
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
Fancy we got their teeth

147
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,455
There is the Jackson Lake Lodge

148
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,527
Giant Mountain Lodge smack in the middle

149
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Grand Teton National

150
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,903
It has 60 foot windows that look out over the mountains

151
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,719
It's all wood beams and paintings of bighorn sheep

152
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
That's kind of nice because the Bankers Trust placed it was hard to get to but you know if you are obsessed with monetary policy

153
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
You could just basically show up which is

154
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,263
What we did we were not technically invited we were

155
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
We already invited

156
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,151
But now is open to the public

157
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,687
The lobby is filled with

158
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Hikers

159
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Families with the

160
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
The kids

161
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
And then

162
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
There are the central Banker

163
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,463
I mastergeorge I'm the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City

164
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
The Kansas City fed they host this meeting every

165
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
And she's essentially the person who decides

166
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,375
What the conference is going to be about each year

167
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,239
So she's a pretty obvious place for us to start as we're trying to figure out what's going on

168
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,335
With the lever but talking to a central Banker is not like talking to your uncle

169
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,407
If your uncle's like all the economy's going to hell like nothing happen

170
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,991
Central Banker says that the economy actually will go to hell

171
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,039
So people like Esther George

172
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
Are understandably

173
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
Very careful when they talk to journalists

174
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
Bryant

175
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
If you can translate

176
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
What we've noticed is globally

177
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
The advance

178
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Central banks

179
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
7 pudding

180
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
A lot of accommodation

181
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
Enter their economy

182
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
And yet not seen inflation

183
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Rise

184
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,287
So that's George saying we're keeping interest rates low but inflation isn't going up The Way We Were

185
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,407
I tried to get her to give me her actual opinion about what was causing the lever to work funny

186
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,735
Not too much I want to be careful that I don't

187
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:22,879
Front run the conference that I don't influence the dialogue there that's pretty much her saying she is not going to answer you

188
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
In short the person who organize the conference

189
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,487
She's not about to explain what's wrong with

190
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
But it wasn't like she was the only person we

191
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,607
I mean we were in a conference filled with people

192
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
So the conference

193
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,703
Is held in a room just off the lobby called

194
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
The Explorers

195
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
Tablecloths

196
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,639
Chandeliers we hung out outside and we just watched as the endless stream of bankers

197
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Can you buy all these like

198
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Regional Federal

199
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
Academic heavyweight they were Central bankers

200
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Iceland

201
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
Israel

202
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
South Africa

203
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
I run just walking up with a little plastic covered name

204
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,231
I'm super close to Jerome Powell

205
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,767
That would have not been a good idea

206
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,583
John Powell he is the chairman of the Federal Reserve

207
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
And according to Brian you're not allowed to touch you

208
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
I think it's a good guideline we also met

209
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
This guy Sean Sebastian in the lobby

210
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
I just talked to his fourth year coming

211
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,151
A whole Bank of photographers comes in and it's like the Oscars for

212
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
Economic nerd

213
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
Like us Sean

214
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Not invited

215
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
But John is not here.

216
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
No he's actually here to protest

217
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,879
He's with a group called Fed Up

218
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
Clever name

219
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
The Covenant

220
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,535
I thought about it a lot and I'm on the fence about how clever.

221
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Actually it up

222
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Cuz it has fed but then the up just

223
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,751
Oh are they saying

224
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
They get means like you've had enough

225
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,615
You get it you see I would think if they took another swing out of there would be happy

226
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,639
Okay but

227
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,991
Protesting the Federal Reserve is not really like protesting your local school

228
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
There's a lot that we're not allowed

229
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
You're not allowed to have sign

230
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,415
They can hand out leaflets

231
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:05,791
Make a disturbance and I don't know like yeah they'll tell us what their definition of that is

232
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
The Deshawn is referring to of these

233
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,423
Pretty tough-looking dudes from the Federal Reserve police which is actually a

234
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,007
Special police force like the Secret Service

235
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:20,383
And they have these matching tan like fishing vests on and the earpieces it was like

236
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,223
Imagine the Secret Service went on this like 10 day fishing trip

237
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
That's what he said

238
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,807
Since the protesters aren't allowed to hold signs

239
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
I swear hand out leaflets

240
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,903
They come up with this kind of brilliant work around

241
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
They put their message

242
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
Right on the t-shirts are all where

243
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
And this

244
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
This is what I love about this

245
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
Even the protesters

246
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
Are in deep deep nerd mode

247
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,215
Like the front of their shirts say things like

248
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Wordful employment

249
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,543
Nah ask me about my story

250
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
But the back

251
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
Is where the magic

252
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,919
Okay I don't have a side in this

253
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
But I have to admire that t-shirt

254
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
Percentile graph

255
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,599
On the bottom and has the years from 1950 to 2020

256
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,695
And it shows that productivity and hourly compensation has been diverging

257
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
Remarkably since 1980

258
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
973

259
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
73

260
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,887
Flat wages below Target inflation Rising e p o p

261
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
Look at the data

262
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
Talk to us

263
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
And the color scheme is nice

264
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
It's just a serious serious t-shirt

265
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
That graph

266
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
It's basically about how wages really haven't

267
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
Grown the way Economist expect

268
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
And wage growth

269
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:32,319
Is one of those things we were talking about before that's been behaving so weirdly in the economy

270
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
You always want to grab drone Palace

271
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
Don't do that part of Italy

272
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
Anagrams room

273
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,719
What you want

274
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
To grab drone

275
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
And say look at the graph

276
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
What is happy

277
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,143
But before we can ask Tyrone Powell or anyone else

278
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,191
Anything they close the doors on the Explorer

279
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
One of the Fed

280
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
Police fishing agent best guy steps

281
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,079
In front in the lobby goes back

282
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
To just hikers

283
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
And Planet Money reporters

284
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,223
And several dozen very very well-behaved protesters

285
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Des Tucson

286
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551
At this point we've got the lay of the land

287
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
And we know how this place

288
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
The go back to the lobby

289
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,415
And we start grabbing economist

290
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
Bankers Adda

291
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Quickly as we can

292
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,023
Before the organizers ring the cowbell

293
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
It says the next session is starting the Explorer

294
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,215
The highlight of the conference is not the views

295
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
Or the antlers it's

296
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
The papers

297
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
Economic

298
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
And everyone keeps telling us

299
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
Dr. John Van reenen

300
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,431
Because his paper

301
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
It's the one

302
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
So I track him down

303
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
And we agreed to meet up later

304
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,623
In front of the giant stuffed grizzly bear just outside the Explorer

305
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
I'm John Van reenen I'm

306
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,791
Professor in the department of Economics MIT and the Sloan School of Management

307
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,607
Been raining paper has some really interesting

308
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
Today's big question everyone is here to solve

309
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,727
Why the interest rate lever isn't worth

310
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
He started by looking at how all these giant new company

311
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
Things like apple and Facebook

312
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,639
Amazon have been concentrating all of this power in

313
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
But I think

314
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,991
What's rhe surprised me when I first started looking at this

315
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
Is that mass increase of concentration

316
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,599
How to build faster than bows high-tech Market

317
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,159
But you also see it happening in

318
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
The majority of other markets

319
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
So you look at

320
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
You've got retail

321
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,815
Shipping thanking Healthcare Airlines insurance

322
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Utilities

323
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
All consolidated

324
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
Actually happening

325
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
Across the wide range of sex

326
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,471
Sectors of the American economy

327
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
And all of these big new companies it might be

328
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
They're what make

329
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
Cantilever racks

330
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
We see this in a Century 3 Way

331
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,919
The first way is

332
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Pricing

333
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,991
The Amazons and Walmart's of the world

334
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,807
The one thing they all do really really well

335
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Is a furlough

336
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Which we like

337
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,767
But those low prices are messing with how Central Bankers should even understand what inflation means

338
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
Back in Paul volcker's day

339
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,839
Prices going down

340
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,143
Might have meant that economy was in trouble

341
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,215
But now it might just mean these giant companies

342
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
Are getting more and more efficient

343
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,847
The second wave andrean says that the giant companies are making the economy Act

344
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
Weird is through borrowing

345
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Used to be

346
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
To become a giant company the important thing was to

347
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,527
Build the best factories and buy the newest machines

348
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
But these days

349
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
The way you win is a company

350
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,695
Is by owning the best version of what Economist call intangible cap

351
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Things like Patton

352
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Software think about Walmart

353
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Increase

354
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
How much school you think

355
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
Low-tax

356
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Exacto

357
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,911
But will not start

358
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
Is that it's invested huge amounts of money

359
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
In building up Vasa

360
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Software

361
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
Because Walmart is just a company would like a

362
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,615
Katana trucks and Warehouse

363
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,431
It's a company that's used all this technology

364
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
To get somewhere

365
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
Now it understands better than any other company

366
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,343
How to move these trucks around the warehouse is really really efficient

367
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
What about the truck

368
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
It's about how you move

369
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
And this is how it ties back to borrow

370
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,815
Another way that the interest rate lever is supposed to work

371
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,655
Is by making it cheaper or more expensive for businesses to grow

372
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:04,031
But companies may not need as many loans to build factories and warehouses that they used to

373
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,847
And that means that the lever won't work on businesses

374
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
The way it used to

375
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,455
The third wave and weed and says big companies might be messing with the levers

376
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
Is wages

377
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
And that one

378
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Might be on us

379
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
So you going to think about so you

380
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Google

381
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,927
Google dominates search and I were to use a Google I would like to search for things

382
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,999
So why is it the Google so Donuts

383
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,559
It's been raining says it's because we as consumer

384
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Made it so

385
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
Right when I want to looks

386
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
Something up

387
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,959
I'm not asking geez I'm not going to be

388
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,031
I'm using Google because Google works fast easy

389
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,639
Amazon if I need something like a new garlic press I'm not going to go look on 10th

390
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Isport

391
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
There's this other thing that happen

392
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,015
We're going to Google and we're going to Amazon

393
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
To get information

394
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Buy something

395
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
We're also giving them

396
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
All this information

397
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
About

398
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
What we want and how we

399
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,791
Think and that actually allows Google and Amazon to make their products even more what we

400
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,631
The Kranks is kind of virtuous circle this kind of chicken and egg

401
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,959
Where buy if you can get to be a kind of a bigger

402
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
Open your kind of platform

403
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,055
You could cut a window most in timeout

404
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
As consumers

405
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
We're actually being pretty well served by all these giant

406
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
At least for now

407
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
But by all of us picking Amazon to be the company

408
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
For buying

409
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Everything

410
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
We're actually changing the job

411
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
How much workers get paid

412
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,999
Which brings us back to the protesters nerdy green tea

413
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,351
The ones with the graph that shows how wages haven't grown all that much

414
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,375
Since the early nine

415
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,679
I showed John Van reenen

416
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Photo of Fisher

417
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Yes

418
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
So this is a

419
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
A famous

420
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,847
Take the statistics graph is a famous girl from the 6

421
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
It says

422
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
Flat wages below target inflation

423
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,991
Rising Appalachia

424
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
Which I believe means

425
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Employments

426
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
Population ratio

427
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
Fraction of people jobs in the population

428
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Veteran says

429
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
The graph is basically right

430
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,303
Bigger and bigger share of profits has been going to all these

431
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Shipping companies

432
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
Smaller and smaller share

433
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
Has been going to work

434
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
It's amazing you can fit this on the T-shirt

435
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
And remember

436
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
4 years

437
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,311
A lot of Economist. Wages would rise with inflation

438
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,639
That was something that they could really control and count on

439
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
This is one of my angel puzzles and

440
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,735
I can only assume social science

441
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
Why you seem respectful to The Baby Show

442
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,903
So this is something we're still trying to understand the need of my post review

443
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,463
Is that there's not a single explanation

444
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,999
The protesters Sean

445
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,023
His theory

446
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
Is that all of this is because of

447
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
Decline in Union

448
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Been reading things that might

449
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Be part of it but not all of it

450
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,263
Is another story which is an economist open up Smith

451
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,335
Monopsony is like the less famous cousin to Monopoly

452
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
Imaginext just one company natal

453
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Nobody else

454
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
Is around with higher pay

455
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
And the company can pretty much decide how much it wants

456
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
To pay workers

457
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,063
They can take it or leave it

458
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
That's when I was

459
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
Even if you come and go Union

460
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,927
What larger firms in particular

461
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
I can do

462
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
Is that can actually drive down

463
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Wages

464
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
Below the competitive level s

465
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,887
Whether it's because of unions or whether it's because

466
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,911
Monopsony

467
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Either way

468
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
Workers end up with less money

469
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
And that

470
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
That matters the lever

471
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,335
Interest rates have been low

472
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
In unemployment

473
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
Has come way down its less than 4%

474
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
But wages

475
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
Wages of knock on a company should be

476
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,551
Be competing with each other to get all these new workers

477
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,879
Now last month we did see a pickup and wages

478
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,463
But in the long run nothing like what a decade would

479
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
Crazy low interest

480
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
Straits should have coffee

481
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,839
Prashant Sebastian and the other protesters

482
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
The solution seems

483
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,679
You just keep interest rates low

484
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,495
Run the economy hot and wages will eventually pick

485
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
Don't worry so much about inflation

486
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,127
A lot of these people at the fed or still shape

487
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Bye

488
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:57,759
The trauma of the 1970s inflation when inflation was actually quite

489
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:03,135
It shapes their entire worldview exactly why we're here and here in Jackson Hole is because they

490
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Worship

491
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,999
Play poker like a God and so we're here we're here in Jackson Hole because

492
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
Whatever 40 years ago he decide you want to go fly fishing

493
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
There was only so much we could

494
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
I talking to protesters and professor

495
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,031
We wanted to talk to somebody who would actually had to make a decision about pulling the

496
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
My name is raghuram Rajan

497
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
Raghu for short

498
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
Rajan is a professor

499
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,735
But he used to run India Central Bank

500
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
He and I sat on a bench under a pine tree

501
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
Looking out over the

502
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
And he told me

503
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
Sean Swayze actually made a lot of sense.

504
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,975
People are not satisfied with the quality of the

505
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,047
C1 finish up what if all those jobs are in a few phones

506
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
What restaurant have good

507
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,935
Still Rajan knows that Central Bankers don't have the luck

508
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
Adjust

509
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,751
Keying in on one element in the

510
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
I'm trying to fix that

511
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,591
Wages interest rates

512
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
Inflation prices

513
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
They all affect one another

514
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Even if we're less sure

515
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
What this kind of conference

516
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
Highlights is weird

517
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Uncertain about

518
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
What really is going on

519
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,159
Central Bankers have the dog with making decisions

520
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,231
When everything is clouded with uncertainty

521
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
And it's not an easy job

522
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,631
What might be hardest about the job of central Bankers isn't deciding whether or not.

523
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
Pull the interest rate lever

524
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,495
It's deciding what description of the economy is true

525
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
On the one hand

526
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
It could just

527
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,871
That this is one more case of economic trend

528
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,919
Taking a long time to sort themselves

529
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,735
All of this weirdness it could just be a blip

530
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
After a decade or two

531
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,879
Wage growth and inflation and everything else it might just start tracking the way it always did

532
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
If that's the explanation

533
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
It might be that the liver is work

534
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,303
It's just working more slowly than we want

535
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
But on the other hand

536
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,887
Maybe everything really has changed

537
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,679
A lot of economist

538
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
Think these giant companies

539
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Have remade

540
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
The way the lever works

541
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,615
And our take away after spending three days with all these sent

542
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Bankers

543
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
Place

544
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,991
Is that the central Bankers don't really know

545
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,295
And so for now

546
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
They're making these

547
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,367
Tiny little moves with a lever

548
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
And just

549
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671
Hoping it will all
