Presenting the podcast against the rules

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,984
Michael Lewis explores the corrosion of fairness in America

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,568
And what it has done to our society mostly without our noticing

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,640
Listen to against the rules wherever you get your pot

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,456
Hey it's Stacey Vanek Smith

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:24,576
And we Planet Money got the feeling that we're going to be hearing a lot about immigration

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,344
For the next team

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:31,232
So we wanted to replay an episode we did a couple of years ago that answers a fundamental question

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
What happens to the economy when a bunch of new immigrants come into a country

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,608
At 1

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,168
Fidel Castro had a problem

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,960
It Was 1980

14
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
And the Cuban economy was in

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
In terrible shape

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,640
For one of the first times in the strictly controlled country there was open to send

17
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
Thousand

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,432
Cubans

19
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
We're trying to leave

20
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
If the country

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
Until this time

22
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:57,088
Castro had basically kept people inside Cube

23
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
But then at this moment

24
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
Overnight

25
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,928
He switch tactic

26
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,976
He went on TV and he said

27
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
You know what

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,792
The people who want to leave Cuba

29
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Are defective

30
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
They don't have

31
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
Revolutionary blood

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
You said we don't want them

33
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
We don't need them

34
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,664
Pastor said

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,944
You want to leave Cuba

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
Findlay

37
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,528
Go to the port of Montreal near Havana

38
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
And go

39
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
On any boat you can

40
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
And Cubans did

41
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
They filled thousands of boats

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Fishing boat sailboats little makeshift rafts

43
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,280
Unexploded 224 mi

44
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Florida

45
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,864
Tens of thousands of Cubans are fleeing the repression

46
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,400
The US Coast Guard is asked

47
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
The Cuban Border guard to stop over loaded boats from leaving Mario Harbor

48
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Key West Florida

49
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,920
Over the course of the next few months more than a hundred thousand Cuban

50
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
Stepped out of those boats

51
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,992
And onto US soil

52
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Jobs

53
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
Didn't have anything with the

54
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
And the US

55
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Now what

56
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
You may see where we're going with this

57
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
I seem very much like this

58
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,512
Is playing out right now in Europe

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
Desperate

60
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
People fleeing their home countries on both

61
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
Coming to try and make a noose

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,472
European countries on the receiving end are asking

63
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,056
Now what hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob Goldstein

64
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
And I'm Stacey Vanek

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,176
When tens of thousands of migrants appear in a country

66
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
There are two big economic

67
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
Number one

68
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,344
They're never going to get jobs and they're going to cost our country a ton of money

69
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
And number two

70
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
They are going to get job

71
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,464
They're going to take my job

72
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:45,120
Today on the show we find out what happened when tens of thousands of migrants showed up in Miami in 1980

73
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Looking for work

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
And we try to figure out what it means for Europe today

00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:42,976
Back in 1980 when Castro said get out mirta ojito was just 16 years old and living in Hawaii

87
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
I just sat down to have lunch

88
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,584
It was an egg sandwich

89
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
With ketchup

90
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,912
Which is when the police

91
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,728
Kings Warehouse knocks on the door and sunset

92
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
Boat waiting for you on the porch

93
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
And

94
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,664
And we left everything behind exactly as it was including my lunch

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
On the table

96
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:07,040
After Castro speech Naruto's father had been one of the first people to get in line

97
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,320
Intel keeping Authority

98
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
He wanted

99
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,392
And mirta was ready to go

100
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
Knew what you was going to grab

101
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,952
2 pens

102
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
Lipstick

103
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
Head handkerchief

104
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
A cheap headed to the port of Mariel with her family

105
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,655
Castro had arranged for public shaming of people like nurses family

106
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
We're leaving

107
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
Musical dear hecklers chanting outside

108
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
Let them go let them go

109
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
Mirta's pens work

110
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
And she and her family

111
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
Crowded onto a little tugboat

112
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
Call Dominion

113
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
They set sail for the US

114
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,599
Mitchell remembers falling asleep outside on the deck of the boat

115
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
With her mother

116
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
Holding her hand

117
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,463
I woke up in the morning the sun woke me up

118
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,095
And by then we could already tell that we were very near the United States because our last one that's above surround

119
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,679
And we talked on in Key West around

120
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Noon

121
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,751
The boat docked and mirta and her family

122
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Walk onto the

123
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
They were surrounded by thousands of other red

124
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
Myrtis parents had no formal education

125
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
They didn't see

126
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Speak any English

127
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
We arrived with

128
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,575
Absolutely nothing and no way to prove who we were

129
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:17,183
And like tens of thousands of other refugees coming from Cuba at the time

130
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
You're just parents

131
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
Headed for Miami

132
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
And started to look for work

133
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
A few years after all this

134
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
An economist

135
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Name David card

136
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Look at this

137
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
And

138
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
Because he's in the car

139
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
He thought this is this kind of

140
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,847
Beautiful unintentional experiment that could help answer a really big

141
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Question

142
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,735
What does a massive sudden wave of immigration due to an economy

143
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
So he crunched the numbers

144
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,879
He compared what happened in Miami's economy before and after the Mariel boatlift

145
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
With what happened in other US cities

146
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
It is at the same time

147
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
Did unemployment go way up

148
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,839
Did all the new people competing for jobs Drive wages down

149
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
The prevailing view was that we would expect

150
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,447
At least a short-run effect

151
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
So what did you find

152
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
Why didn't find any evidence of that

153
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
80000

154
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,199
Refugees came to Miami and there was no effect on the economy

155
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
Couldn't detect

156
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
Eddie

157
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
Strong evidence of an effect one way or the other

158
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,647
Now there is some debate about

159
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
Some Economist argue that in the short run

160
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
Wages for low-skilled workers

161
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,327
Can fall when lots of low-skilled immigrants

162
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
Arrive

163
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,191
But on the bigger questions about immigration in the economy

164
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,983
Pretty much

165
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,823
Greek for most workers immigration is not a problem

166
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
For most workers immigrants do not drive down

167
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
They don't

168
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Steel Arch

169
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
And the reason for this

170
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
Is that there is not

171
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,783
Fixed number of jobs in it

172
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
Win a bunch of new people show up

173
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
Yes they get you

174
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,719
But they also start buying stuff right away

175
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
Start getting haircuts and going to

176
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
Go to the grocery store

177
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,119
And that means there need to be more Barbers and more Grocers

178
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
That creates more jobs

179
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,799
Yep pretty much the second her family arrived in the US they had to start buying stuff

180
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,359
From the get-go you become a consumer

181
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,687
You need that skinny mattresses you need sheets you need

182
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
Everything

183
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
2

184
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,319
Set up Ally them in the less you bring the more you consume

185
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
No to be cleared this does not mean we can just

186
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,207
Look at what happened in Miami in 1980 and say okay great

187
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,303
We can just let in some unlimited number of people and no matter what the economy is

188
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095

00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,423
The Economist says there are very particular circumstances

190
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
That allow a country to

191
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,751
To take in a large number

192
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
People at once

193
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
The first thing is that the country needs to have

194
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,895
Pretty strong economy

195
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
Because in the short-term there is a cost

196
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,223
To accepting Emery

197
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Healthcare shelter

198
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Social Services

199
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,343
And that burden can be pretty big

200
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,695
Germany did this calculation and it found that one Refugee cost

201
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
About $14,000

202
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
A fragile economy could get crushed by

203
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
David cards

204
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
Second rule the second circumstance

205
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,935
It needs to be true is

206
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
People who come to a new country

207
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
Have to be able to get jobs

208
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Pretty quickly

209
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
Because of course that's when they start contributing to the economy that's when they start

210
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
New jobs

211
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:20,223
In the case of what happened in Miami back in 1980

212
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,807
There was a huge Cuban Community already in place

213
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,903
It was the Cuban community that really helped out in your toes mom and dad

214
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,999
Your friend of a friend somebody who knew him from Q I found him a job

215
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,815
Driving a truck of bananas

216
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
Company called yes bananas

217
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
And my mother found work

218
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
Sodium ions in in effect

219
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,567
An incredible thing to me about the story at about the United States is that

220
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,127
We arrived Monday

221
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
My Thursday my parents were working

222
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,503
On the following Monday I started summer school

223
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,575
Weirdest parents didn't speak any English

224
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
What's a huge Cuban community

225
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
They didn't need to

226
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,695
My father figure out that he only needed to learn if

227
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
Few words

228
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:08,095
To understand what was going on with the truck and I wrote him out for him once I knew that myself

229
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,423
He put him in the pocket of his shirt and there he went

230
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
For all of the fear that there was on both sides

231
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
The Cuban refugees

232
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,311
Did just fine in Miami

233
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,871
And Miami did just fine

234
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
But the Cuban refugees

235
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Tokay

236
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,247
What does this tell us about what's happening today in Europe

237
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:30,879
Because clearly all those things that mere to live through are happening right now 35 years

238
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
I'm home run Cafe

239
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,351
I'm 23 and I'm from Damascus Syria his brother about

240
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,935
They went to Turkey and they hired a Smuggler

241
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
Anytime $1,200 each

242
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
And what about four together

243
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
People the crowded onto this little

244
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,871
Inflatable raft and they set sail for

245
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,247
About an hour into their for our journey the boat began to deflate

246
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,783
Water started flooding in

247
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,831
Pitch black outside

248
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
No one could see

249
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,415
Omar's brother got so scared

250
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
He fainted

251
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,303
Screaming door even fighting some people are fighting

252
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
Toto's crazy

253
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
I have nothing to do about praying and

254
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
I just hope that we could

255
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Survive

256
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,591
Homerun held onto his brother with one arm and with the other he grabbed

257
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
Plastic bottle in Sparta

258
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
Bailing water out

259
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Eventually they made

260
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
To this tiny Greek Island

261
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Call danira

262
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
As soon as home run caught his breath

263
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
He texted his mom

264
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
Told her that we're okay

265
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,183
Can I call you once I get the chance

266
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
Omarion and his brother like a lot of migrants

267
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
Began to make their way to the

268
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
Wealthier part of Europe to Western Europe

269
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,399
David card The Economist he says

270
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,519
Western Europe meets his first Criterion for being able to absorb vitamin success

271
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,359
Despite the economic troubles in Europe we've heard a lot about

272
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:01,247
Western Europe is still Rich enough still has a big enough robust enough economy to absorb that the migrants that are coming in

273
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,343
And remember David cards rule number to getting jobs quickly

274
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
This is a little different

275
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
For the Syrian

276
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,743
There's not a huge establish Syrian community in Western Europe the way it was

277
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
Cute established Cuban community in Florida

278
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
But the syrians have something else

279
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Going for them

280
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423

Workers are retiring

Unless people can come in to fill those jobs

314
