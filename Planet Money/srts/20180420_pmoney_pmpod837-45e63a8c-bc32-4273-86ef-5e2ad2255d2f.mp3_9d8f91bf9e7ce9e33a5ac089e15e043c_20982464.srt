00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,792
The story today

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,584
It's going to take us around the world

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,864
But it starts in New York City

4
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:07,424
About a year ago there was this conference

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,216
In a fancy room some

6
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:09,984
Diplomats

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,752
The senator from

8
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
Virginia former senator from

9
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,592

00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:18,176
This guy comes up to the podium he's wearing a purple shirt

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen

12
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
Good afternoon

13
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:25,088
His name is Patrick ho

14
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,368
He's from Hong Kong

15
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,952
And he's becoming a regular fixture at these types of events

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,280
It's not quite clear what he does but he does run a think tank

17
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,328
Seems to have a ton of money to spend

18
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:39,168
One of his favorite subjects is China Centre under the global stage

19
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,192
He says it's

20
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,752
Crucial in this increasingly unequal world

21
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,544
The top 10% of earners

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,336
Fa exceedingly well

23
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,128

Ultimate

27
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,296
Everyone is harmed by India

28
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
Equality

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,856
Houses the rise of China

30
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,624
Is a force

31
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,904
For good the world

32
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
Globe lights

33
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488

36
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,352
A reorganization of the world

37
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
Balance of power

38
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,704
Patrick Howe was on a mission to make it happen

39
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
Well think tank

40
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,520
We're dedicated

41
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
To addressing issues

42
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,128
Relating to the emerging

43
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,408
Decisions

44
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
China

45
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
Besides me a thing tag

46
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
We're also a dual tank

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,576
Which we don't only think

48
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
We do things

49
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:31,904
So

50
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
Not just a think tank

51
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744

52
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,280

Was doing a lot

54
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
What people at that event didn't know

55
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,656
Is that over the past few years

56
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,448

A game of trying to gain power

70
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Smaller countries

We find something else

75
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,208
Including secret Bank transfers to world leaders

76
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,048
Mysterious Tycoon and the global rush to control African soil in

77
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,888

Kira Noir

79
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,472

Is an arrest

At JFK

93
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
On a cloudy afternoon last November

94
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,504
Hoe gets picked up by the FBI

95
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
They pick him up because Federal authorities

96
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,600
Saho wasn't just a talker

97
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
He was a major fixer

98
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,952
We called his lawyer he declined a comment

99
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,768
But according to the US attorney this fixer

100
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
Patrick ho

101
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
Was bribing foreign officials

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
In one transfer through New York Bank

103
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
He allegedly said

104
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
$500,000

105
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
To a guy from East Africa

106
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
Find out why we're going

107
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
Do you got that I talk to you

108
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,992
Journalist in Kampala

109
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,552
We're calling him by his middle name up Willie

110
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,392
We're not going to use his full name because you've done is not a safe place for Journal

111
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
What's right now

112
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
A lot of them are getting arrested lately

113
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,303
A police told me that recently he noticed something changing

114
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,631
And it has to do with the barber

115
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,703
Normally when he goes to the barber in Kampala

116
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
Ecc's photos on loud

117
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
You definitely find Ludacris

118
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Will Smith

119
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,127
Usher American celebrities

120
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
Stylish haircuts

121
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,247
If they collected royalties from the barbers in Africa orgasm make a ton of

122
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
That's true

123
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
But recently a Puli

124
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,671
Barbers popping up around Kampala

125
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
With no Usher on the outside

126
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
No lyrics

127
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
Is a barbershop Chinese words

128
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,095
And the Bob has a Chinese

129
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,935
It makes sense a lot of Chinese people are moving to Uganda

130
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
They need haircuts

131
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
But the Chinese people in Uganda

132
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,079
They're building more than just Barbershop

133
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,919
Everything from roads to buildings to Malta hotels

134
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
That Ministry of Foreign Affairs was built by

135
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
The Chinese the president's office

136
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,807
Whitby built

137
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,367
The president's office

138
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,695
Oh man and they built the Ministry of Foreign Affairs

139
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
Yes it did the living Ministry of Foreign Affairs

140
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
That's like

141
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,071
The equivalent of the state department in

142
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
In the US

143
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,167
Yeah and remember Patrick ho from Hong Kong the fixer

144
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,263
He has a connection to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uganda

145
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
The criminal complaint against ho

146
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Says that he

147
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
He said half a million dollar bribe

148
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,919
That minister

149
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
A guy

150
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
Sam kutesa

151
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Whatever

152
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,319
Issue of corruption that comes up in the country

153
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
Sample thesis

154
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
Gonzalo Vega

155
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,047
This is Owen cabin gay the Ugandan journalist he's working on a story about Chinese business in Uganda

156
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,375
We met up in New York you just gotten back from Kampala

157
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
And he has met Sam kutesa

158
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,495
He's one of the

159
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
What do you call the Untouchables

160
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
I mean he's well-connected

161
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
He's a very wealthy man

162
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
He knows all the players

163
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
And he's smart

164
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:15,295
He's on the top of the food chain if I'm a city

165
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,855
And there's another reason he's untouchable

166
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,903
His in-laws with the president

167
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
Can't get fired

168
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
Ana president

169
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,279
He's around the country longer than I've been alive

170
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
Since 1986

171
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
His arguments

172
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,167
Which is valid is that

173
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:37,567
He is elected whenever he runs as president

174
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,127
Goats are like that is

175
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Debatable

176
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
He's gotten rid of term limits

177
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
He controls the army

178
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
But they do have elections in Uganda

179
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Ndk

180
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
Is where the half a million dollar bracket

181
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:57,279
When that fixer Patrick ho send emails about that half a million dollars he was sending to Uganda

182
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
He called it a donation to The re-election of the president

183
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,167
So Sam kutesa he takes this

184
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,007
Donation to his in-laws the president

185
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
He's happy the president's happy and they win an election and what do the Chinese get

186
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
In one of those

187
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Household rights

188
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
Just give me a list of all the major projects

189
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,135
Text from infrastructure energy agriculture to finance and banking

190
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
And we will bring the relevant heads

191
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
To your country

192
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Kickstart

193
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,631
Project this is the thing is that many of these companies bidding to get these contracts from the Ugandan

194
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
Government to build

195
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
All this infrastructure

196
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
These are Chinese companies

197
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,543
And guess where they're getting their money

198
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
Vidya Balan got me just going to borrow money

199
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
From the Chinese Banks to undertake

200
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,271
Major construction of an infrastructure project

201
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
If I'm

202
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
The Ugandan

203
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
Ministry of Roads

204
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,183
I will get a loan from

205
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,535
A Chinese bank and then use that money from a Chinese Bank

206
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
To pay a Chinese construct

207
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:09,471
Right and under the government of you guys going to go through a transparent process of calling out for beads

208
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
You used air quotes again

209
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,127
It's actually called the Ugandan national roads Authority but you get the

210
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
The Chinese companies

211
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
Always seem to get the

212
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
And it's not just infrastructure

213
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,807
Also natural resources

214
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
Because the thing about Uganda

215
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
It has oil

216
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Daughter Thai

217
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,231
They've only gotten into the game relatively recently

218
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
But China needs oil

219
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,863
They need a lot of oil nearly 1.4 billion people

220
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,423
That's a legit amount of people

221
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,031
China wants to get in on the ground floor of uganda's oil into

222
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
Mystery just as it started

223
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
Do you want access

224
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
Titties potential energy Reese

225
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,479
And these resources are all over after

226
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,039
The country of Chad also has oil

227
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
And guess what

228
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,159
Federal authorities say Patrick Howe ride the president of Chad to

229
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,231
And this is why Patrick ho is bribing these guys

230
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
He wants things for his think

231
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Yes

232
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,351
But he also wants things for China

233
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Next we find out

234
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Where all this money is coming from

235
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,263
Right it comes from a huge Chinese oil company

236
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
That appeared out of nowhere in the lab

237
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
They spent money all around the world

238
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
They're worth 40 billion dollars

239
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
They're called cefc

240
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,759
Atracoes Think Tank was funded by

241
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
And Workforce

242
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
Okay so we're leaving Uganda

243
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623
And headed to Prague

244
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391

3% share of a bank

257

00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
Journalist here in China begin wondering

296
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
Who are these

297
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039

They learn from the company's website that ya used to be connected to China's military

303
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
And then when they ask the company about this

304
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,607
It responded by deleting that information

305
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Website

306
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,215
At the time Scott cendrowski was working for fortune in Beijing

307
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
He was baffled

308
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,311
Company just had gotten very scan coverage

309
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,407
Even in the the Chinese press no one really knew anything

310
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,479
Scott's been two years trying to land an interview with the agent

311
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Finally

312
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783

You had kind of a nervous are around him

317
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
Scott said ye was surrounded by minders

318
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
People whispering in his ear

319
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
Call them

320
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
The chairman

321
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,031
Who's the prettiest tilted interview you know right off the bat he asked it to be off the Record and

322
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,359
We're travels from Beijing to Shanghai and that's

323
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,199
What's the last thing you want to hear before you ask your first question so I can

324
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
Quickly it's a deal was on the record

325

00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,375
How do you private Oil Company like cefc rise so quickly

329
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
In a country where the energy sector is

330
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,727
Controlled so tightly by China's government

331
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
How does a guy like yeah young man with a murky

332
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,359
He passed behind a company now worth more than 40

333

A billion dollars

334
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
Who is this guy a business genius

335
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
China's government engineered all of this

All the other companies in this industry are

343
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
So we need to look

00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047

00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,063
Only the most powerful men in China have red phones on there.

00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,343
Top leaders

368
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,879
In the heads of state-owned

It's so they can call each other up

370
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
Quick without worrying about being

00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Bugged

It's behind him whenever he delivers an address to the nation

The phone day of course I said no no no that's

378
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,031
Just internal line

379
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
But

380
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
The impression is

381
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:43,967
The guest know that she also has a red phone in his office so it's impressive that he has one as well

382
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,759
And that leads us to Xi Jinping

383
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
A leader with big plans for China

384
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,415
Plans that the insta Tycoon and the jail fixer

385
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
Are putting in jeopardy

386
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
To explain these plans I bring you

387
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,863
A bedtime story sponsored by the Chinese government

388
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
Once Upon a Time

389
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,935
Sample route slip

390
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,239
Central Asia Europe

391
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,055
It was called Silk Road

392
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
People

393
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,711
You got to see this video it's a Kiki looking blonde guy who starts reading this very odd

394
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
Bedtime story to his daughter

395
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Who seems

396
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
Way to win

397
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,599
Interested I'm watching this in this is very weird

398
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
Well they got the guy just looks away

399
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
And they got a mad frog

400
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
Show me the girl with the mask

401
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,351
Camels

402
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Okay

403
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,911
Rub what is this

404
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,519
It's a propaganda video on the website of the state news Outlet the China Daily

405
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,823
It's official government communication mint

406
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
To reach a foreigner

407
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
Few years ago it's like the old routes

408
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
Even bigger

409
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:57,951
Belt and Road initiative and Road initiative

410
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,791
When he took power 5 years ago Xi Jinping wanted China

411
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Had to play a more prominent role in

412
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Global affairs

413
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,911
The belt and Road initiative was how he

414
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
Plan to do it

415
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
A global trading Network

416
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Led by China

417
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
Its banks and Company

418
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
Way to spread Chinese investment and influence abroad

419
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,687
It aims to be the largest infrastructure an investment project

420
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
History

421
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:25,599
But people start paying attention when you're working on the largest global investment project in history

422
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,903
NAD being influenced to do it

423
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,511
After Chinese company won the bid to build a high-speed rail network in Hungary

424
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,559
Investigation into building violations

425
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
Same thing happened in Nepal

426
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
The Chinese Dam

427
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
Last year in Sri Lanka

428
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,751
Chinese company bought one of the country's largest ports

429
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,543
A 99 year lease

430
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Started a riot

431
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
That fortune writer

432
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
Scott cendrowski

433
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,735
He says that in much of the developing World China state-owned Enterprises

434
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
Is there they're called SOS

435
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,831
We're becoming synonymous with corruption

436
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,439
Chinese SOS don't have the the sparkling reputation

437
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
In Africa

438
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,071
Wire or other parts of the world where they've done business and in fact

439
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,911
Save tarnished the reputation of Chinese companies that come in after them

440
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
I interviewed

441
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,703
Several China

442
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,543
All of them had come to the same conclusion about Yaya

443
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
Is mysterious company

444
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
They said

445
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,455
Because China's state-run companies that develop such bad reputations worldwide

446
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
China's government may have essential

447
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
Chosun CEO

448
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,807
A private company

449
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,343
Seemingly no cover

450
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Connections

451
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,647
To begin taking their place

452
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,183
Because the Optics

453
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
Is China's government

454
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Is behind

455
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
CFC

456
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
This might explain why Patrick ho

457
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
Who works for yay in the US

458
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,959
If so many presentations about China's belt and Road initiative

459
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
At that event in New York

460
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,055
Even then he was talking about the Belton

461
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,455
Ncfc with sending money to the president of Chad it wasn't just to secure a lease or build a road

462
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:00,831
It was a hell of a larger Chinese state-run company reduce a billion dollar fine

463
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
That's really weird

464
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,415
Normal companies don't help the competition

465
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,695
CFC

466
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,975
Seems kind of like

467
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Trojan Horse

468
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Air China

469
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:13,887
They make friends with these guys like the foreign minister of Uganda the president of Chad

470
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,983
So that the Chinese government and its companies can March in

471
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,055
And this is what happens when your power hits its peak

472
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,871
You get involved in countries across the world

473
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:29,759
Yeah you end up robbing up some less than democratic governments as we've seen in Uganda

474
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,575
Because it's easier to bribe them and get what you want

475
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,391
And the same thing happened with the British Empire the

476
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,207
The US in the details can get pretty ugly

477
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,511
And seeing how the sausage gets made

478
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,559
It can undermine all your globulin

479
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
This right here is a real look

480
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Into the sauce

481
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,239
Robert Peck is a former New York criminal defense at

482
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,055
Who divides his time between the US and honk

483
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,359
What's striking about this cases

484
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:00,991
How complete of the picture is that supplied by these emails it's almost as if

485
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,623
The emails and the criminal complaint that reads like a Hollywood script it's so complete

486
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,183
He's read the indictment of patrico and he says

487
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
The case against him is

488
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Is so damning

489
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,047
He thinks it's likely cold will have little choice but

490
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
Cooperating

491
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,375
With prosecutors and tell them what he knows about

492
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,655
About CFCs activities

493
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,703
And it's connections inside China's government

494
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
And about China's Global plan

495
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
So this case

496
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
And the whole

497
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
Question of

498
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,687
Foreign corruption by Chinese companies has huge implications

499
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:34,271
For the belt and Road initiative if it turns out

500
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,599
And that Chinese companies are routinely bribing

501
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
Foreign officials than that

502
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
Is a stain on me

503
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,303
Belt and Road initiative and it's a it's a huge embarrassment

504
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,119
It is already pretty embarrassing

505
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
China's government

506
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:55,775
And that may be why lately it's been pretty hard to find the insta Tycoon

507
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Asian

508
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,591
He has now disappeared

509
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,407
He's reportedly under investigation by Chinese authorities

510
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,455
Nobody seems to know where he is now

511
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,271
State Farm is taking over the company and its

512
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,063
Began selling off all its proper

513
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
Ask for a fixer Patrick ho

514
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
He's in jail in New York

515
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,719
Robert Praxis are clues that he

516
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,487
Please cooperate

517
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
With Federal Prosser

518
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Scooters

519
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,607
Hose agreed to a trial date in November of this year

520
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,191
I thinks his lawyers want to negotiate with us official

521
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:31,103
It's a terrible dilemma because if he goes to trial it's very likely he'll be convicted in face years in jail

522
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
On the other hand

523
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,735
If he pleads guilty and he implicates others that's going to have a Fallout

524
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
As well

525
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,575
It could mean the people will turn against him

526
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,623
They they will label him

527
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
A Trader

528
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:48,767
Put pressure on family members in Hong Kong

529
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,631
Who might be the targets of actions by powerful people in the mainland

530
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,703

Connections

533
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:02,079
The Chinese government and its role in seeing things belt and Road initiative

534
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,919
The safest place for him might just be his current address

535
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
A jail cell

536
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,223
