The unwritten rules of power

20
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,672

It was that the world is rigged

30
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,104
The ends justify the means and

31
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,664
You're either pulling the strings or you're the puppet

32
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
And

33
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224

Not to earn his love

41
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,864
I was willing to do illegal and unethical things

42
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912

00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,984

00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648

Working with Wall Street whistleblowers to bring cases against some of the biggest banks in the world

49
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792

During and after the financial crisis

70
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,312
Jordan Thomas worked as a lawyer at the SEC the Securities and Exchange

71
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
That's one of the federal agencies that regulate wall

72
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,224
While he was there he helped create this new whistleblower program

73
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,576
What is the program people who see Banks or other companies breaking the rules

74
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,880
Can anonymously report it to the SEC

75
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
If the SEC follows

76
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,232
Tip and whines up collecting money from the bank

77
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
The Whistleblower is eligible for an award

78
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
It's like a bounty

79
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
After the program was up and running

80
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
Jordan went into private practice

81
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,216
Helping whistleblowers bring their cases to the SEC

82
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,336
In exchange if his clients get paid a bounty his firm gets a chunk of the money

83
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,408
He's become one of the preeminent lawyers in the field

84
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,992
The clients have provided tips that have helped the SEC

85
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,832
Collect hundreds of millions of dollars from some of the biggest banks in the world

86
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,416
He told me he thinks there are a few reasons for his success

87
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,976
One is we're very selective

88
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:18,047
We get in contact with all kinds of people

89
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
Whack jobs Washington security theories and Foxhole conference looking for get-out-of-jail-free

90
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,567
Our job is to come figure out who the good guys are

91
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
The real whistleblowers

92
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:35,199
The ones who know where the bodies are buried in the ones that can lead us to the

93
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
And

94
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
Pretty good at that

95
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
I think the

96
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
II

97
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
Thing is that were

98
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
John Hardin realest

99
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
We understand how things really work

100
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
And

101
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
Are willing to use non-traditional tactics

102
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
Grey the grey Arts if you will

103
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,887
Good example is csec

104
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
Is not permitted

105
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
2

106
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
Covertly record conversations

107
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Well

108
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,407
IRS whistleblower Advocate working with my clients can

109
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
Covertly record conversations

110
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,039
In many states in the United States including New York

111
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Cracked

112
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,927
And I'm sometimes joke that some of my clients must have been trained by Mossad because

113
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,791
They have enough recordings of of people that are good that are game changers

114
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
So in the past the SEC

115
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,703
Would have to build cases from the ground-up circumstantial

116
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,775
Now my clients are bringing them

117
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:36,383
You know countless recordings of senior people talking about wrong doing

118
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,943
It doesn't get much better than that

119
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,039
What can you tell me about specific clients of

120
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,951
Not much our clients tend to be a senior people with a lot to lose

121
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
And actually

122
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,559
The number one question that was a lower come to

123
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
What's a bar council with is

124
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Will I lose my job

125
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,751
Will I be blacklisted in my career

126
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
And

127
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
Other than to see what's above program

128
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
You can report anonymously

129
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
And so

130
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
Yeah and many of our

131
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,991
Anonymous whistleblower cases

132
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
We will

133
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,367
Make arrangements for the SEC to speak to that the client

134
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
By phone

135
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:24,255
We will use voice change technology to change the gender

136
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
Timber of

137
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:31,935
The whistleblowers voice so the SEC itself can't even identify the voice of The Wiz

138
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,215
Whistleblower right

139
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,799
You said you can't talk about the clients

140
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
I know that

141
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,687
You mentioned a few cases are there instances where you can talk about the case

142
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
Now let me give you the example of

143
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,271
JP Morgan

144
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,855
JPMorgan was still was telling its clients

145
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
That they would

146
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,743
Objectively pek of the best funds

147
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
For their clients

148
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,863
When in fact they had a bias toward picking

149
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,679
Dietary products in which they made more money

150
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,751
And sometimes as products and work performance

151
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,335
Because they they were able to make greater fees

152
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,687
And our client along with another whistleblower not represented by us

153
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,063
We're able to provide evidence of that to the SEC and the SEC was able to confirm that

154
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,135
This is something that affected over a hundred thousand

155
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
JP Morgan clients

156
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,511
And was stopped because of our our client

157
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,839
And what happened to JP Morgan

158
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,911
What would they have to do as a result

159
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
And pay over 300 million

160
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:42,079
And Jordans client in that case got an award of 13 million dollars

161
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,175
Second whistleblower in that case represented by a different attorney

162
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
Got over 30 million.

163
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:54,879
Those awards were announced just a couple months ago and that was the third biggest case in the history of the SEC whistleblower program

164
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,279
The biggest award was last year in that taste Merrill Lynch got in trouble for misusing customer funds

165
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,607
And three whistleblowers all represented by Jordan Thomas

166
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,935
Rewarded a total of 83 million dollar

167
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,055
Even now does Merrill Lynch know who the whistleblowers were who your clients were

168
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Now they don't

169
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Wow

170
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,223
The same as JP Morgan if we do if we do our job well

171
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,575
Our clients can and do continue working

172
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
At

173
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
The organizations in which they reported

174
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,743
Even though they can buy an island some of them like working so they keep working

175
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,279
I mean not to be

176
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
Glib but there is that

177
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
There's like

178
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Hey Bob

179
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,215
How to show up in a Lamborghini today

181
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:54,783
Machete I am calm secret Millionaire's and I'll people who won The Whistleblower award but choose to keep working

182
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
At the same firm

183
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
It does happen

Well

204
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
My mom is a former nun

205
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
I like a joke that my

206
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,287
My mother is a cross between Mary Poppins and Mother Teresa

207
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,823
Seems pretty good

208
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
Ya know she is

209
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
One of the most loving

210
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
People that I've ever known

211
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,039
But she's also not a worldly person

212
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,319
And

213
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:37,695
As a result I think that the world I wasn't hasn't always been kind to her

214
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,511
How did she and your father

215
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Get get to

216
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,863
Together they sound like they were living in very different worlds

217
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
Well my mother

218
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
She was in a Convent in

219
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
Compton California

220
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,383
And my father was working in politics in Los Angeles

221
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
And she and another none

222
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Went to

223
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:05,855
Hey public hearing to advocate for crosswalk near the the school if she worked for

224
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
And

225
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
Somehow struck up a conversation

226
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
And

227
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
A year or so later she

228
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,791
Left the convent

229
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
And

230
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
Began dating my father

231
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
And

232
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
Shortly thereafter

233
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
They had a surprise

234
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
And that was me

235
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,567
My parents weren't married long and she were married my stepfather

236
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
Who was regularly unemployed

237
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,687
And kind of saw me as an anime

238
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,807
At different times in my early life I was neglected

239
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,111
Abused and homeless

240
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,927
But I got glimpses of

241
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
More Glamorous Life

242
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
When I visit my father

243
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
What did he do what was his

244
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,607
Jabra weltmeister

245
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:52,191
My father was a rising star as a Young Man

246
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
He

247
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
I came from nothing

248
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:00,895
Went to Community College then went to a night law on unaccredited night law school and then ended up working for

249
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,967
The County Supervisors in Los Angeles

250
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
And then

251
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Was

252
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:10,879
The first elected black judge in Southern California

253
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
And

254
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
Then

255
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,231
Abortion I got in a serious car accident

256
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
And

257
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,071
The car accident require them to take prescription

258
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
Painkillers and

259
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,703
Prescription painkillers affect your ability to

260
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
Affects your judgement

261
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,055
And so he was medically retired from the bench

262
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
And kind of all of his dreams

263
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,431
Future seem to fade away

264
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
So after

265
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
His

266
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,271
His path is career ended

267
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Key

268
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,367
Confused of what he knew

269
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
To solve problems for

270
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
People if people wanted to

271
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,815
Be appointed to certain positions he would help them get a point into those positions if he wanted

272
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:54,655
To receive federal funds for something he would I use his

273
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
Political connections

274
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
Sure Builder

275
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,311
And I you wanted to build beyond the code

276
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Music I you go to

277
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,943
He solve problems and help people kind of Leverage

278
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
The government

279
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
How did you think about your

280
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,855
Dad when you were a kid and how did that change as you were growing up

281
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
You know I idolized my father

282
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,975
He was everything that I hoped

283
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
To be

284
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
He know he knew famous people

285
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:28,191
Party with celebrities drove fancy cars lived on the beach or near the beach

286
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
How to farm in Hawaii

287
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,799
I mean it was so hot he was he

288
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,871
And cuz that was his existence

289
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,687
Now he ate every meal out

290
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
Flashy kind of a successful

291
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
For the person and

292
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,135
Turn up the alternate universe that I lived in was

293
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,183
How is my mother and stepfather

294
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,255
+ mobile home parks we didn't have a lot of money

295
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,095
I remember going regularly to the day old bread store

296
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,191
Scrape off the mold and you know eat them bread and

297
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
It was that it was stark contrast

298
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,287
The life we lived

299
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
And

300
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,383
I guess every son wants to be like his father but

301
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,663
For me

302
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
He was everything

303
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
My dream

304
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
Wants to be

305
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
I his number two

306
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,391
And my father's plan

307
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,743
Was for me to enter some form of politics

308
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
And then

309
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
Cop with that

310
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Sort of

311
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
Station

312
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Will power

313
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
And influence

314
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
It's interesting I mean

315
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
I could imagine

316
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
Going up to a different way if you

317
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,151
You know going to the day old bread store and Senior

318
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,735
Father go out to a restaurant at every meal wondering

319
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
Well why he isn't

320
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
Giving your mom money

321
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
Take care of you

322
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:56,255
Yeah I think that that is something that I didn't appreciate when I was younger

323
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,583
I'm by began to appreciate more later

324
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,119
As I Grew Older

325
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,679
In my teenage years

326
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,983
Turn my idealized image of my father

327
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
I began to crack

328
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:13,151
As a student at UCLA I was finally living close to him and began to

329
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
To see him at his worst

330
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
Dishonest with those close to him

331
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,063
Motivated by self-interest and

332
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,879
Dependent on prescription drugs

333
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,487
I saw him for who he actually was not who I wanted him to be

334
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
And during the start time

335
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,119
I became depressed and you're suicidal

336
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
When was that

337
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
When I was 19

338
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Patrick close call

339
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:43,871
More drunk behind the wheel on a Steep Ravine and in the Malibu Hills almost died on

340
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
I'm driving

341
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
Anyway I need cat needed to break away

342
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Entirely

343
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
Brokers my father

344
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
Shortly thereafter

345
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,415
And that point I decided to reinvent myself

346
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Essentially

347
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,023
Putting myself into a witness protection program kind of

348
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,327
Of my own making

349
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
What's an interesting choice of phrase

350
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,775
What do you mean by that I didn't believe that if I stayed in Los Angeles

351
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
I could

352
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
Can't wait for my father and his info

353
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
And

354
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,455
I thought my best chance of

355
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Having a new beginning

356
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
Was to

357
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
Get lost

358
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
And

359
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,439
I didn't know it at the time but it also was important for me to find myself

360
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
And so

361
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:35,583
I sold everything I could I couldn't backed up my old Volkswagen Bug and

362
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,935
Transferred across country to Paddington on the well-known modern dance school in Vermont

363
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
It was like the farthest away

364
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
From

365
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
Where I was

366
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,359
And I never been there and

367
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:52,991
Help make this transition I legally change my name to Jordan Thomas

368
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:59,391
My first name was Jordan because I I love Michael Jordan love playing basketball

369
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
Adam.

370
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,743
So I thought that would be a good first name and

371
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,583
My last name was Thomas at it because it had some

372
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
Titan

373
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
My

374
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
Old man Thompson

375
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:15,263
And my middle name have a good store to it I think

376
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,591
Insight eye related to kind of Michael Corleone's

377
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,919
Efforts to legitimize himself in The Godfather

378
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
I took Corleone's

379
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,063
Original name and Delaney as my middle name and

380
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:33,439
That point fully detached for my family friends and kind of former life

381
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,767
It didn't end well for Michael Corleone it didn't end well

382
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,167
I suppose I didn't think through that had as much as I should have but it has ended well for me

383
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,007
What was your name before you were Jordan Thomas

384
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Paul Thompson

385
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
Does anybody still call you Paul

386
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
No

387
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,503
Do you think of yourself as as Paul Thompson at all

388
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
I don't

389
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
You know

390
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
Up until very recently

391
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
I couldn't remember anything

392
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
About my

393
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
My life prior to

394
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Changing my name

395
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:14,655
4 million dollars on a gameshow I couldn't have told you

396
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,751
One name of a friend teacher coach girlfriend

397
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
Even today after

398
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,615
Going back and trying to remember

399
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,175
I don't remember much about

400
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Call

401
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
I think that

402
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
Most of of

403
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,599
His life was was very difficult

404
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,391
It's amazing that you called

405
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,695
Can you use the word his

406
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
Rain-X like it's somebody else

407
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
It really is

408
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,959
You said until recently you didn't remember anything was there something that cause you to remember

409
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
There was

410
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,335
There was a New York Times story that came out

411
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:58,431
But that profiles me and alluded to some of

412
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
My past

413
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
And

414
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
It felt

415
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Surprisingly

416
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
Made me feel lighter

417
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,207
But I felt like because of that feeling

418
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,791
I realize that I hadn't fully dealt with

419
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
My past

420
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
And

421
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
As a result

422
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Have encouraged by

423
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,751
My clients and some of the readers of the profile

424
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,567
You told me that day that I inspired them

425
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,919
I decided to revisit and investigate my history

426
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,479
So what I did is I

427
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,039
Took time from working and travel

428
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
2

429
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,391
All the places that I once lived and

430
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,695
Sought out people who knew me then

431
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
Grand

432
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
Try to

433
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
Remember

434
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
What had happened

435
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Attempt

436
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
Terrifying

437
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
It was

438
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,703
But

439
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
Necessary

440
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:58,335
Jordan gathered up old family photos and letters he kept stored away

441
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:03,455
He got on a plane to fly out to the West Coast to talk to people who knew him but he was Paul Thomas

442
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
And

443
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,111
For me that was a moment and I was at 35000 feet or something like that and I was reading

444
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,951
Old letters that I've written and looking at pictures and

445
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
All of a sudden

446
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,303
My memories started flooding back and

447
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,911
Literally the woman next to me said are you alright because I was just like

448
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,703
Clearly affected

449
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
And

450
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,591
That was the beginning of me beginning to see

451
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,407
What I hadn't been able to come

452
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Revisit

453
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,015
Were there any particular moments on that trip

454
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,855
That that stand out specific conversations you had

455
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
Places you went

456
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,415
You know I

457
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
I had

458
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:49,535
I talked to you about the airplane experience night light

459
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,863
I also remember I had a different point

460
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
Meeting with my

461
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
Cousin near me

462
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
When I was a teenager

463
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
Hand

464
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
Her describing

465
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
An incident where

466
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
Chuze babysitting

467
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
And I

468
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
I wanted to make pancakes

469
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
Somehow

470
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
I made batter and then

471
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,319
Toaster

472
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
Honda

473
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,647
Obviously that didn't go well

474
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
And

475
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,976
She would calls talk talking to me about

476
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,512
My reaction

477
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,816
What was your reaction

478
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,400
Apparently I lost my mind and it was like

479
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:32,288
I'm not going to be tonight was going to be as soon as he was like the world's end it was like

480
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
There's just

481
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,872
Hide me

482
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,152
And

483
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
Some of these conversations help

484
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
Just to see that

485
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Terrified child

486
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
And

487
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
Can grieve for

488
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,512
One of the things that I've kind of learned from my clients is that

489
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,072
Secrets are rarely empowering

490
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
So

491
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Part of

492
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,912
My decision

493
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,936
Was

494
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,032
To no longer keep the secrets and that's why I'm speaking you today

495
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
Reflecting on

496
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
Where I am today

497
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
I know that

498
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
I wouldn't be doing the work I do

499
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,504
But for

500
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,552
Encouragement my mother

501
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,160
I wouldn't be as successful as I am and doing what I do

502
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
But for the training

503
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,280
Google dark arts

504
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
By my father

505
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
And

506
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
I would have had the courage

507
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,424
Two kind of

508
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,496
To take this unconventional path

509
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,544
But for the difficult

510
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,640
Times in my life and the need to recreate myself

511
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
So

512
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
I've been kind of holding on to

513
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,248
2 secrets

514
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,832
My nose have been the foundation

515
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
Of my life my success

516
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,696
Who I am

517
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,936
