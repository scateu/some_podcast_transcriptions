We pull it in McPherson Kansas late at night

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,200
It is a small town just off the highway

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,248
But it has the skyline

8
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
It looks like

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,296
Manhattan I swear

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,064
Towers

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
Shooting into the sky all lit up

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,672
You see the lights way before you see it and start wondering

13
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
WhatsApp

14
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,536
Vince Pinkston lives in McPherson and he works in those bright hour

15
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,584
This is an oil refinery

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,608
It's run by CHS

17
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,912
I mean everybody that's here they know what it is

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:44,032
Is it home it is a very strange home as we can see the next morning when we get it to her

19
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,640
Maybe you've driven past these things before but I never been inside it is amazing

20
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
Thousand

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,944
Pipes tanks

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,504
Little cat walks up on the Smoke Stacks

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,832
Noises that single flame burning from the highest stack

24
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,112
Yes the pilot light

25
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,720
This is where the Planet Money oil is going to be turned into gasoline

26
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:09,376
Evap sensor sounds crazy go back a couple of episodes we bought a hundred barrels of crude oil from a Kansas preacher

27
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
We got a pump

28
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,984
And tested and slurped into a pipeline and headed here

29
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,312
And this Refinery is where the magic is about to happen

30
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,896
Just so you can picture it we are wearing hard hats and blue lab coat

31
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,480
And we are the only humans walking around between the pipes

32
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,784
I have always wanted to ask this

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
What if by refinery

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,392
Do you really need so many pipes

35
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:37,536
I mean there are thousands and thousands and thousands of twisting and turning pipes and it seems except

36
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
3 fishing yet

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:45,984
All this time we've been talking about crude oil like it's one thing just this thick black liquid that

38
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
Pull out of the ground in

39
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
Can touch and smell

40
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,616
But a Refinery does not look at crude that

41
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
Them crude oil is a mixture of

42
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
All these different

43
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
Different kinds of molecule

44
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
These long and short hydrocarbon

45
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Blocks all jumbled

46
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:06,720
It's like how I used to pick up my kids toys at the end of every single day and sort all the Legos in two different Bass

47
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
But basically Refinery does

48
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,304
It's sort like with like

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
Gasoline with gasoline diesel

50
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
With diesel

51
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,680
Sorting and separating over and

52
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,800
Which sounds easy until you think that all those different kinds of fuels are of course

53
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
Inside

54
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Royal

55
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
That's why refineries

56
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Are so cute

57
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Extraction overacre

58
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
Miles and miles of pipes

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
Because at each step

60
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
Tank they get a little more usable

61
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
Fuel out of our oil and after

62
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Gasoline

63
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
Diesel

64
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
Propane butane

65
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
The bits left goes to something called

66
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,352
CHS just got a new Coker

67
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,912
And the entire Refinery was buzzing about

68
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,240
Everyone says I look

69
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
This is our new Coker

70
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
Boheme online in February

71
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:58,688
Okay this thing that is tall and has also took like little balconies on it

72
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
Turn off the new thing

73
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Yes

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
There is no way

75
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,368
To describe this we've been in this huge debate about how

76
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Picture this

77
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
Powers and spiral

78
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
The best thing we came up with was a sort of

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
Post-industrial water park

80
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
And the Coker is made up of

81
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
These two enormous

82
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,656
Black Smoke Stack look

83
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,424
Thanks

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Tower over everything

85
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
And where you separate all the

86
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
Different sizes of Molly

87
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
What's the like with like

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
Is essentially by cooking crude

89
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
In tray

90
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,968
In this koeckeritz like a very tall Ava

91
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
They called the column

92
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,576
Realize there's more heat at the bottom of the column then at the top

93
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,136
So how hot in the bottom and how hot is the top

94
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
And I'm excited about 840 on the bottom to call him

95
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,584
40 degrees Fahrenheit 60 on top

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,704
So you can cook a steak basically the bottom and the top is more like a cake temperature

97
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,520
Good sear on a good steak on the bottom yet

98
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,080
So I should cooking the crude oil be black

99
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
Car light

100
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,920
Gook stays at the bottom of the column the gases

101
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Move up to the top

102
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
Are all the different kinds of petroleum products

103
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
Sort themselves out in between

104
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,136
Can you list off the different things that are oil will become here

105
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,976
Natural Gas Propane butane

106
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
Gasoline diesel

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,911
Are some of the sulfur that removed in other processes goes into fertilizer

108
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,495
Will get turned into butane propane

109
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,567
Gasoline and fertilizer so if we

110
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,967
Go eat a sandwich in town we could be eating our oil

111
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
Really

112
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
That's surprising

113
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,207
Defected a pretty good chance of that because CHS who runs this Refinery it is owned by a

114
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
Cooperative of farmers

115
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
So they are really interested in the diesel and

116
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
The fertilizer

117
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
But after they take that out I mean nothing else

118
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,399
He's wasted effect

119
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,471
The reason this Refinery is so huge

120
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
Is it they're trying to squeeze

121
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,103
Every last molecule of hydrocarbon out of our crude oil

122
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
Oil is in everything

123
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
It is in plastic

124
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,831
Of course but it is also in the toothpaste I brush my teeth with when I got up it's in the shampoo I used it's in my phone

125
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
It's my radio recorder

126
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
It's my sneakers and my shirt

127
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,463
It is even in the aspirin I took after drinking

128
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
A little too much at Montana Mike's

129
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,143
Hello and welcome to Planet Money and Stacey Vanek Smith

130

And I'm Robert Smith today in the show

131
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
How oil got into everything

132
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
And why we're having a pretty hard time getting the oil out

133
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Of everything

134
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
Just Jack and Noah King have it story

135

The story of how oil got into everything

150
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
Starts with one man

151
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,487
A chemist named Leo Baker

152
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
And as far as we can tell

153
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
He thought about chemistry

154
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
All the time

155
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,655
Yeah we heard this one story from someone in Leo's

156
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
Extended family like

157
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
He's very extended family

158
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
Call Kauffman is a

159
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,103
Great grandson-in-law or a great step grandson

160
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
I'll take it

161
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:40,895
Carl says

162
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,967
Leo had this unusual way of dealing with hot summer

163
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
He would simply

164
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Walking Dead

165
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,575
The pool with his clothes on

166
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Get himself nice

167
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,415
She soakin wet walk out cool off and

168
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
Go on about his business

169
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Search without ever

170
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
Putting on a swimsuit or anything else is he said

171
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Evaporation

172
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
The cooling process

173
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
Thinking like a chemist

174
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
Drinking like a camel

175
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Exactly

176
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,543
The clothes that Leo wore into the pool would have been made of some natural fiber like

177
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
Because this is how things work back then

178
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,175
His toothbrush handle would have been made of sterling silver

179
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,991
And his comb was probably tortoiseshell

180
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,575
And I If he if he smoked his cigarette holder would have been

181
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
This world is all natural

182
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
And it was really expensive

183
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,999
Leo had the comb in the suit and all these things

184
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
Because he was a rich guy

185
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
Not everyone could afford these things

186
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,655
Susan Frankl a science writer says

187
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
It wasn't just

188
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Expensive

189
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
Getting all her stuff from nature

190
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
What's hard

191
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,871
Now this is around the time that scientists are tinkering with electricity

192
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,687
Which of course will make life much easier

193
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,759
But at the moment it's presenting a huge challenge

194
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,575
Which has electricity starts a lot of fires

195
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,159
You've got plugs and sockets and wires and they need coding

196
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
Because Sparks are flying

197
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,255
And right now you know what they're using is coding

198
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
Something again all natural

199
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Bucks

200
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
Bear using bugs

201
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,679
The wonderful and beautiful Lac Beetle that she

202
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
Black beetle

203
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,495
Get it not the guy last

204
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
Beatles the shellac Beetle shellac

205
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,919
The people weren't lifting up the skirts of millions of hugs and pulling out the lady ones

206
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
The shellac bug

207
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
Excreta kind of resin on tree branches

208
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:25,087
And people collect that resin and make that into shellac

209
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
But still it was a

210
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
It took 6 months

211
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,975
And 15,000 Beatles

212
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,791
To get a pound of this Reza

213
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
Leah was looking at tallac

214
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
And he saw a problem

215
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,191
Kind of shellac all these new electrical plugs in

216
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,727
Sockets and whatever

217
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,287
Just wouldn't work on such a big scale

218
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,943
And we know he was thinking about the shellac conundrum because Leah was one of those people who wrote down

219
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
Everything in his big lab notebooks

220
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
And I am amazed little diary

221
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,647
His step great-grandson Carl says he'd write down everything in those dire

222
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,255
What he even that day what he thought of the wine he had a dinner what time he went to bed

223
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Who he was mad at

224
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,119
Sewing show came to visit me and he had a good idea but he's such a

225
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Sabor

226
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,983
So he talked smack kids talk smack about people

227
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,079
He was very candid about it she talk smack about a lot of other chemists

228
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
And, smack talk is like

229
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
Oh so and so has a good idea but he

230
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
She's not controlling the conditions of his experiment

231
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
At the time there were lots of other camera

232
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
Looking for a solution

233
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
Some alternative

234
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
Shellac bug

235
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,743
And there was this one very abundant

236
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
Oil

237
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
It was mostly being used

238
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,583
Ways to make kerosene

239
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,351
For lighting

240
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,655
But after you made the kerosene

241
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
There was all this Gunk left over

242
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
With all these chemicals

243
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,519
It seems like

244
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
It should be useful somehow

245
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,383
But Susan Frankel says no one knew how to use it

246
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,991
John D Rockefeller looked out over his oil refinery one day and he saw these like

247
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
Blue flames coming off the

248
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
The top of the

249
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:04,671
Smoke stacks and it's like what's that somebody said well that's definitely answer you know we don't use it sweet

250
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Just Burn It Off

251
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,023
It's like I don't want to waste anything you know find something to do with that

252
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
We don't know if that story is true

253
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Not the way you like it

254
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,351
It works for us

255
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,423
The chemist for playing around with this oil-based

256
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
And the waste from coal

257
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,031
And hoping to invent a better insulator at the Lac bug

258
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,615
Process chemist would try different combinations of stuff

259
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,663
But the results were always a mess

260
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
The thing would boil over and there would be

261
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
Baby stuff splattering all over the place and you'd end up with

262
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
The spongy Mass

263
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
A useless gun

264
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Useless gun

265
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Uselessjunk

266
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:41,535
It would give off an odor so powerful that three weeks later you still couldn't go in the room with it will obviously

267
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,119
You can't use it for anything if it stinks so badly you can't live with it

268
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,935
You know you can kind of Imagine Leo writing in his

269
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
Is Diary like

270
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
These other chemist just don't know what they're doing

271
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,287
I'm going to do them one better

272
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Let me try this

273
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
That's what he does he

274
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,431
He starts doing his own experiments in his personal lab

275
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
And it was dangerous at first

276
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
NFL

277
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
The reaction going on with

278
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Is hot enough

279
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,111
There was a good chance that as you poured this in

280
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,671
The fumes of this alcohol like me

281
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Material

282
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
Would burst into flame immediately

283
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,583
Hope you have a room full of propane gas and somebody throws a matching

284
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Boom

285
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
The gas is

286
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
Explosion

287
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
There were

288
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,983
Yeah there were flash fire

289
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:27,359
Just put it that way and make it sound so delicate butterflies fire sounds

290
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
It was terrifying

291
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,199
Bill looked around his expensive laboratory and thought

292
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
No

293
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,783
So he said okay will do that in the garage so I can

294
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
Can afford to burn down my garage

295
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
I got kind of burnt out by Laboratory

296
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
For five years Leo tank

297
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
First videos

298
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
What's the big problem

299
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,511
The flash fire

300
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
He gets those under control

301
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,839
But the stuff is getting out of here

302
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Experiments

303
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
Still a mess

304
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
He just keeps making goo

305
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
He realizes

306
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
He needs a special oven

307
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
That can give him first

308
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
Control of temperature and the pressure

309
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
But nothing like that exists

310
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,455
This might have stopped other chemist

311
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,759
But it doesn't stop the

312
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,295
Out in his garage

313
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
He bailed

314
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
His special

315
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:14,207
It's a couple of feet high and it's shaped like an egg in that was there pressure vessel

316
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
And you could control

317
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
Both the temperature and the

318
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
Pounds of pressure very precise

319
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
We have a picture of it here

320
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
And it does

321
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
Just look like a giant egg

322
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
Is made of iron

323
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,055
Yeah it's it's all soldered together and it's got a

324
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
Pipe running in one side

325
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
And then it's got this wheel up top that I guess you

326
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
Crank to open it

327
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
It just kind of looks

328
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Steampunk

329
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,575
Musically memes his new machine after himself

330
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Of course he calls it

331
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,671
The big lizer

332
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,791
And one day in 1907 he prepares his latest mixer for the bay kleiser

333
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
And this is for the chemistry Geeks

334
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
To take something called spino but you can get

335
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,239
From oil or coal tar and adds an alcohol

336
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
He uses formaldehyde

337
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,103
Combined sum in a test tube and put it in the bay kleiser

338
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
He sets his oven to

339
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
Exactly the right

340
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
And when the time is right he opens it up

341
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
And this time what he finds is not

342
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Goo

343
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,623
He finds this hard amber colored material

344
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
And it is molded in the shape of a test

345
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,279
He just made plastic in a lab for the first time

346
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
And he calls it

347
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Bakelite

348
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
I'm nursing a trend here he's not

349
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
Recreation

350
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,983
We haven't diary entry for this day

351
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,567
He didn't write Eureka in all caps on the page

352
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
But here's what he wrote

353
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,199
I consider this day is very successful work which has put me on the knot of

354
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
Several new and interesting products

355
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
Which may have a wide application as

356
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
Plastics

357
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
And varnish

358
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
And they complained about some chemist dinner that he's got to go to

359
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,719
Leoda's note start shopping around his new material

360
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,791
He talks to people making those newfangled electrical thing

361
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Things and tell them

362
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
Stop messing with all those bugs

363
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
You can use this new thing I've made

364
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
From fossil

365
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Eagle Eye

366
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,239
It doesn't melt

367
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
Burnt you can use it for those light bulb bases

368
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,847
Electrical sockets or light switches

369
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
And he talks to the Ford Company

370
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,711
The Model T had just come out and this was

371
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
Perfect timing

372
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
They needed something heat resist

373
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,391
Assistant for the guts of the car in the engine for things like spark plugs and distributor cap

374
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
Bakelite with it

375
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
And this is the moment when a boil starts

376
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
Peeping into everything we know

377
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,607
Because companies love this cheap new material

378
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,423
Soon everything we know is being made from plastic

379
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
And at the time

380
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,519
It was the really hot stuff

381
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
There was no other plastic

382
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
Compete with it there's nothing else

383
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
We had anything like the properties of Bakelite

384
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
That was it

385
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
So bakeland had in effect

386
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,087
He wasn't just part of the plastic manager he was Supply

387
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,207
In 1924 Leo made the cover of Time Magazine

388
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,303
Susan Frankel the science writer actually dug up a copy of the article

389
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,887
It's a breathless review of this thing made from oil

390
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
The material Bakelite

391
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,055
From the time that a man brushes his teeth in the morning with a Bakelite handled brush

392
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,919
Until the moment when he removes his last cigarette from a Bakelite holder

393
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,223
Extinguishes it in a baked like

394
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
Ashtray

395
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,319
And falls back Upon A Bakelite bed

396
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
All that he

397
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Touches

398
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Cease

399
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
Uses

400
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,231
Will be made of this material of a thousand years

401
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,047
Time Magazine wasn't overstating it

402
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,887
One-wheel figured out how to make plastic out of fossil fuel waste

403
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,983
He took us from a world where toothbrushes are made of sterling silver

404
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
Like how much would that cost

405
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
Two world where they're made of plastic

406
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
And you can get one for a couple bucks

407
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
This is

408
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Huge

409
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
Everyone can get one of everything

410
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Process

411
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
This was important to Leo

412
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,855
He was proud to be part of that he thought that was important he thought the

413
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
It is just to make products

414
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
The only

415
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
The crown jewels

416
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
Could afford to buy you know

417
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Fun

418
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
But he would not have

419
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,447
Been interested in Bakelite on the Seesaw mass-market sport

420
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,263
And very widespread applications that would

421
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
In effect

422
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,383
We're down to the value of the middle class not just the elite

423
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
Bill Beekman Farm to company

424
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
And the company started calling Bakelite

425
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
The 4th

426
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Kingdom

427
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,831
As an animal vegetable mineral and now

428
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Bakelite

429
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
A whole new category of

430
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Stuff

431
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:34,303
Leo had cracked this big chemical mystery using waste from fossil fuels and other chemists cop.

432
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
It's like

433
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:40,191
We had this molecule here and we get Ziploc bags we had this molecule and we get styrofoam

434
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
You had a different molecule

435
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
You get your kids Legos

436
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
And today

437
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
It's infinite

438
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,943
The shoes that I'm wearing have definitely got petroleum materials not just the plastic but the pigments in

439
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,247
In the coding this is John Warner

440
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,807
He's a chemist the telephone that I'm holding

441
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
Certainly have petroleum materials

442
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,183
I have a little plastic sticky thing on my phone

443
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,511
That my three-year-old daughter gave me I don't even really know what it is

444
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
Left made of petroleum

445
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,351
I've got a little statue of

446
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Bach

447
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
On my desk and that's made out of

448
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Petroleum

449
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
So what do we make

450
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Of all of this

451
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,567
So basically today if you're going to have anything

452
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,639
It's going to be partly made of oil or fossils

453
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,687
That's Leo's Legacy

454
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
And Karl wishes

455
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,247
That Leo could be

456
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Celebrate it

457
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:30,367
That he could be remembered like Thomas Edison like a great inventor

458
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
Any kind of frustrated he is it

459
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
But

460
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,231
Some of Leo's other

461
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
Extended family his great-grandkids

462
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,839
They have more complicated feelings about plastic

463
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:45,983
Because oil is so cheap and plentiful plastic is also cheap and plentiful and everywhere

464
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
Including the ocean and piling up in landfills we had this conversation with Leo's great-granddaughter Roberta roller

465
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
And she says

466
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,711
She's proud of Leo baekeland and plastic

467
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
He created

468
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
But she also tries to avoid using it

469
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
I try not to buy

470
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,415
Stopping plastic I don't buy my vegetables wrapped in plastic

471
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,207
You know things like that

472
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,791
No it's unavoidable sometimes

473
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,119
I order something from Amazon it all comes wrapped in plastic

474
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:18,751
And Leos great-grandson Hugh told us he goes around picking plastic bags up off the side of the road

475
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
People feel uneasy about pasta

476
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,127
What chemists are doing now is basically

477
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,455
Trying to undo what Leo baekeland discovered in

478
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,039
His lap I feel kind of a cosmic connection to Leo baekeland

479
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
The Blob Discovery was made

480
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
On my birthday

481
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,695
No I kind of make that connection

482
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,767
Killmeyer is a chemist at the University of Minnesota

483
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
And Mark has

484
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,351
Two big problems with the way we make plastic

485
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
He says for one thing

486
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,983
Plastic can hang around forever it's not biodegradable

487
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
And second

488
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
Oil is limited

489
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,151
But Mark story is a really good illustration of how hard it is to make

490
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
A new kind of plastic

491
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,479
One that is not made from oil

492
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
He's trying to make one made of bets

493
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,343
You bring an ear of corn to a knife fight

494
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,903
Yeah

495
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
Astride corn

496
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,255
Also coconut orange peels caraway seeds

497
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
And you know what worked

498
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Peppermint

499
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Menthol

500
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,631
We came up with them using menthol

501
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,935
Hot the same menthol

502
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,471
That's in cigarettes and candy

503
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,007
I think in my gum

504
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
Exactly like peppermint gum

505
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
The plastic made out of peppermint was

506
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,383
Durable like regular plastic

507
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
And it was biodegradable

508
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
We broke down in water

509
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,527
Marx thought you could probably use this to make a lot of stuff

510
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Sneakers that hold up

511
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,879
Just like regular running shoes

512
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,927
But when you're ready to throw him out

513
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
Bury them in your backyard

514
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,767
Compostable sneakers and Mark

515
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,815
Published his research and got the word out

516
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
To the big pots

517
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
Look at what we can do

518
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,959
It was a beautiful success

519
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Nobody was

520
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
It just was not

521
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,663
Inexpensive enough

522
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,783
To to make a product that would compete with a petroleum-based counterpart

523
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,623
You don't even get to make your peppermint and corn shoes and then have

524
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,951
People say I'm not going to pay $97 for those when I can get them for

525
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
450

526
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
You just didn't even have anyone ask

527
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Try

528
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:23,167
That's right and I mean it's not really 97 versus 57

529
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,495
It kind of fits the shoes cost 57 these would cost 500

530
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,127
Peppermint is a lot more expensive than the oil-based ingredient

531
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
Polyethylene

532
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
Peppermint oil is 20 bucks

533
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
What's a kilogram Mark told us

534
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
Polyethylene is $2

535
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,855
Mark went back to the lab and tried a totally new strategy

536
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,927
Instead of trying to find the molecules he needed

537
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Nature

538
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
He got a biochemist

539
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,767
Make them

540
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,815
A genetically modified

541
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,351
E-coli bacteria

542
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,423
Which I normally think of something that would make me sick

543
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
But in this case he use the coli

544
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Turn sugar into a

545
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
Key ingredient for plastic

546
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,639
And he remembers a colleague bursting through his office door

547
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Showing him this

548
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,967
Plastic made from a coli bacteria

549
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,247
I was thrilled

550
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,039
I was absolutely thrilled

551
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
What did it feel like

552
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,623
When you held at

553
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:18,464
Stretchy material that bounces back so much like a rubber band

554
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:22,048
When I had this material in my hand I do from my experience

555
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
The years working on these

556
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
Have projects that

557
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,400
We really had something

558
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,984
Mark says this plastic made from bacteria is just as

559
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
Cheap as the stuff made from oil

560
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,848
But it's new plastic isn't in stores yet

561
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,896
Cubes in a couple years you bites

562
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,200
Car tires or a box of Band-Aids

563
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
And you might be buying

564
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
E-coli

565
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,576
Still marks plastic only works

566
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
For certain things

567
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,880
Only about a fifth

568
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,648
Of the plastic

569
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Fix Wii U

570
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,488
And it took him 20 years to get this far

571
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,280
This is hard to do without oil

572
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
So just

573
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
Marc hillmyer actually sent you some of his

574
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Is e-coli

575
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,680
Has taken the mail right

576
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,984
He did and he also said he's sending

577
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Two pairs of

578
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Gloves

579
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
So I'm actually a little bit nervous.

580
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
For I don't know

581
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Yeah

582
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
Moment of Truth year

583
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
Oh my god there are glass

584
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:22,976
Oh this is it okay put your clothes on it's in a little ziplock baggie

585
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,768
The little square it's like

586
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
I don't know an inch and 1/2 by 2 in

587
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,352
And it's

588
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
It's hard plastic action

589
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
It's like the kind of plastic

590
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,728
I think about

591
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,032
I don't know maybe Tupperware

592
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
Something like that

593
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,616
Except stretchable Tupperware

594
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
End

595
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,200
And it's clear and it's clear

596
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,224
See through it

597
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
It doesn't look

598
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
It doesn't look like cutting edge.

599
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,856
No I do really want it

600
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,160
I dare you to lick it

601
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
I dare you to lick the occult LaPlace

602
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
Okay we will do it

603
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,400
You licked it you licked it

604
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
Oh my God

605
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:09,568
We're wearing gloves can I didn't really curious

606
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600

Into Augusta

613
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:37,472
Yes actual people will be using our oil we hope

614
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:43,104
Vince Pinkston showed us the very noisy pipeline that takes are refined fuel from the refinery out

615
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
And where is this pipeline going

616
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
Council Bluffs

617
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
Where is that

618
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224

619
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760

Ends were going with it

00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,720
It's like a graduation

625
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:05,120
It is like a graduation Let It Go with the oil but the oil is do something bigger and better

626
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,448
The other side and now it was graduated into a usable product
