1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,048
When Richard feiler was in grads

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,632
He had this economics professor who was also a wine color

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,192
Bobby had a firm rule that he would

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,728
Pay more than

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,752
$30

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:11,776
Parabola

7
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,848
This professor would sometimes buy bottles of wine in

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,384
And then store them for decades

9
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,224
At some point Taylor found out the in this collection were a few bottles

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:25,344
Professor bought for like ten bucks and they had aged into Beauties and $100 bottles

11
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
And in fact

12
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
There was

13
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:31,488
A wine store in town that was happy to buy his

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,048
Old weld preserve bottles

15
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:38,144
But the professor would not sell those old well-preserved hundred dollar bar

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,192
He saved them to drink himself on

17
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
Special occasion

18
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
Which sounds reasonable enough but

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,592
Given the professor's refusal to spend more than $30

20
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,616
On a bottle of wine

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:52,224
It didn't make sense to Richard sailor it seems like a violation of basic economic

22
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,040
If you're not willing to pay

23
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,064
100

24
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,368
To buy a bottle of wine then you should

25
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,160
Sell it rather than drinking

26
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:06,304
When he's drinking a bottle of wine that cost $100 he's effectively sing I'm not going to sell this and get $100

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,632
I'm going to drink exactly effectively paying a hundred bucks

28
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Exact

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,472
Richard sailor became obsessed with these kinds of stores

30
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:17,568
Where people are violating the basic rules of economic

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,616
Until we started keeping a list of them

32
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,408
On the chalkboard in his office

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456
The list disorder

34
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,760
Dumb stuff people do

35
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,600
Like for example when people want fewer choices rather than more

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
Or when they go to a movie

37
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
I know 10 minutes and that it's going to be awful

38
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,512
But then they sit through the whole thing just cuz they paid for the

39
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:42,400
Taylor got pretty excited about this list and he even at some point showed it to his dissertation advisor

40
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
He didn't

41
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Much

42
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,592
And Andy never did

43
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,504
The New York Times later reported that the advisor thought sailor had wasted a promising career

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob and I'm Kenny Malone today on the show how Richard sailor went be on Netflix

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,256
Help save us from ourselves and won this year's Nobel prize in economics

46
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,816
Like I'm nerd superhero origins

47
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,680
This message comes from NPR sponsor Capital One

48
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
Capital One is reimagining banking

49
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:23,104
I offering accounts with no fees or minimums that can be open from anywhere in 5 minutes

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Capital One

51
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
What's in your wallet

52
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
Capital One na

53
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,272
Richard thaler got his PhD from the University of

54
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,088
And took a job there as an assistant professor of echo

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
So I'm teaching there

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,696
And I'm kind of floundering a bit

57
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:41,536
I was writing papers on the economics of crime and things like

58
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
And you know I'd decide line

59
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
Nobody really took it seriously

60
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
Goodbye sideline he means

61
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
That list on the Choctaw

62
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
Richard turned into a sort of obsession

63
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
Analyzing Waze

64
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
These people behave

65
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,640
Irrational when he talked about this list other account

66
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,432
Yeah yeah yeah

67
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
We know

68
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,784
Lots of people are dumb

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
Everybody you don't need a pot and storm around

70
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
Overall on

71
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
Average they're going to be rash

72
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,256
And this is a core Assumption of echo

73
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
People on average behave rash

74
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,936
The model that Economist build the predictions they make are based largely on this

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,776
And then one day Richard sailor meets this other young actor

76
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
Psychologist

77
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,616
Anntaylor starts telling him about his list

78
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
You know what you should check out

79
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
This research

80
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
By these two guys I used to work with in Israel

81
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Daniel Kahneman

82
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,576
And Amos tversky

83
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,368
Tok Taylor walks over to the

84
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,952
And I had to find a whole new section of the library

85
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
The psychology section

86
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
He starts pulling down these papers by continent

87
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,144
And I got very very

88
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
I'm like racing

89
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Through

90
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,496
One paper after another

91
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,312
Willits is like watching

92
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
Thriller on

93
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
With a big screen

94
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,016
I just to remind everyone you're reading psychology papers I'm reading psychology papers and my heart is beating

95
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,088
It's the most excitement

96
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648
I've ever felt SSI

97
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,232
Really is that still true is that still true now

98
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
Yeah that was like the big light bulb

99
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
Here's what that light bulb was

100
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:25,215
Kahneman and tversky we're proving that there were all of these ways where people are

101
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,799
Predictably consistently irrational you would take

102
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
Morales everybody in the world put them in a pot

103
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Sturm up

104
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,687
And these guys were fighting people do not

105
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
Behave rationally on

106
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
They were finding that people make the same kinds of mistakes

107
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
Over and over and

108
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
It starts to Dawn on

109
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
He's been making this list of life

110
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Random

111
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
Cute stories

112
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
People doing weed

113
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,863
Cure to psychologists who are doing actual science about those same kinds of things

114
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,703
I mean is there some sense of like I'm not alone in this

115
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
Well there was that

116
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
Although these two guys

117
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
Are over in Jerusalem

118
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
So you're still kind of alone

119
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,455
I'm pretty alone you know it's a long way from Rochester

120
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:08,991
But shortly after

121
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,111
Sailor found out the condiment and tversky were scheduled to be in California at Stanford University

122
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
For one year

123
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
And

124
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
I decided to just

125
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
That my entire life

126
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
On this

127
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
And

128
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Flew out to stand

129
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,143
Spent a few days sort of

130
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
Begging anyone

131
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
To give me a

132
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
Visiting position

133
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
So that

134
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,871
I could be there when my heroes arrived

135
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,199
And meet them and talk to them and learn stuff

136
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
You get the one-year giggetts

137
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Meet Kahneman tversky

138
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
And

139
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Everything clay

140
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
So I was teaching them economics in

141
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,231
They were teaching me psychology and

142
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,327
You know 40 years later Danny conoman is still my best friend

143
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,703
This work that condom in and tversky and sailor start doing trying to understand the ways in which

144
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
People are consistently

145
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
Irrational

146
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
It comes to be known

147
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
As behavioral economics

148
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
It's economics

149
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:09,919
With

150
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Real people

151
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
With Kahneman and tversky

152
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
Taylor is now able

153
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
To start pulling down those

154
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
Little anecdotes from his list

155
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:22,207
And test them and say okay is this just a cute little thing I noticed or

156
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,511
Is this one of those things that we are

157
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
Predictably irrational about

158
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,143
What are the famous studies they do together, and Taylor and one of the researcher do this

159
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
Is about mugs

160
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
Mugs as in

161
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
The thing you drink coffee

162
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
So they walk into class

163
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
And they just give me

164
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
The half of the students in the class

165
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
There were

166
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
44 students

167
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
So22 mugs

168
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,271
That special Mugsy's we're just things that Richard sailor picked up at the Student Union

169
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
And then they told the students who got them

170
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
This is yours to keep

171
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
If you want it

172
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,159
You can have it

173
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
But

174
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
You are also allowed to sell it to one of the other students

175
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Who did not get them

176
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,119
Play basically just said like Ready set go you don't have your money you all have money

177
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,935
So you guys have mugs buy it or sell it do whatever you

178
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
And what they found

179
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,775
What's the people who did not get a mug

180
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,567
Tended to offer

181
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
Like two or three bucks

182
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
The people who had the mumps like are you kidding me

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,503
Drive me to dollars is I would not sell it for a penny less than 5

184
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,343
I remember these people are holding onto their mugs for five bucks or better

185
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,415
There's some random they didn't have the mugs 5 minutes ago

186
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
Didn't have any sentimental value

187
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
And yet they value their mother

188
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,559
Twice as highly as people who have not been given mug

189
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:35,167
I didn't have this mug and care about this mug but now that I have that I'm not doing that

190
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,191
The discovery

191
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
With that simply

192
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
Having a thing

193
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
Makes you overvalue that thing

194
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,871
I ended up calling this the endowment effect

195
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,967
Like that professor of sailors who wouldn't sell that hundred dollar bottle of wine

196
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Indominus

197
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,367
You got World Series tickets for face value you know you could sell them to a scalper for 2,000 bucks

198
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
You go to the game anyway

199
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Endowment

200
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:03,071
Sofia ellar and Cottman and tversky and a few other people are doing more and more of these studies

201
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,911
Finding more and more ways where people are predictably irrational

202
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,983
But it's still just a few people

203
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:16,127
You know what they're doing is still pretty fringilla still basically outside of the mainstream of

204
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
And then Richard sailor gets this odd kind of

205
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
There's a big new economics Journal starting up

206
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
Call Dad

207
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
Journal of economic perspectives

208
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
The editor calls up sailor and he says

209
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
How much were to call in for

210
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
You can write about

211
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
The things that you and others are finding

212
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
In a column called anomalies

213
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
Was when Richard thaler and behavioral economics

214
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Blew up

215
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,447
Just calling what's the best thing in Journal of economic perspectives

216
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
Famous economist Tyler Cowen

217
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
And the professions

218
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
Just got addicted to this

219
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
Every issue would come out

220
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
People would be talking about Fowler

221
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,943
The other thing I did was it really grabbed the interest

222
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:57,343
Undergrads like myself famous economist Betsey Stevenson

223
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
Who are we meeting them

224
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:03,743
I'm thinking oh okay so I can ask these kinds of questions

225
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
What will that mean for my res

226
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,583
Famous economist Greg mankiw

227
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
I don't think people appreciated

228
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,215
At the time that this was going to open up a whole new field and it has

229
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
And also

230
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Famous economist

231
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Richard thaler

232
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
It's a soapbox

233
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,663
Not only are you up on your soapbox with people are gathering around tools

234
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Yeah

235
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,295
The column helped behavioral economics become a real thing

236
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
People were excited

237
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,159
But a lot of Economist had a pretty reasonable criticism

238
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
A lot of these findings were coming from classroom experiment

239
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Oncology

240
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Like the mug

241
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Sure

242
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,095
What is that really prove

243
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,399
Do these findings also hold up in the Rio

244
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,471
And there was always looking for ways to

245
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
The testes ideas in the real world

246
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,127
Overtime he found more and more one classic example came when he was spending a year in New York

247
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
Taking cabs around town

248
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,503
And started talking to the cab driver

249
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,855
And you weren't at the way this business works is the most drivers will rent the cab

250
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
12 hours

251
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,951
And then it's up to them whether they want to work the whole 12 hours or knockoff

252
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
ISO trailer is called

253
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,815
Start trying to figure out how do the cab driver sort of

254
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,167
Manage their dead how do they decide how long to work when did knock off

255
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,007
Very often the cab drivers have

256
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Some number in mind

257
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
At the start of their day

258
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
They think like okay I need to make

259
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
Say $500 in my date

260
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,223
And then when they hit that number they stop

261
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,807
So aesthetic 6 hours and then they hit five hundred bucks.

262
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,879
If it takes all 12 hours they work 12 hours

263
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:40,255
And then they stop this means that they wind up working less working shorter hours on the busy day

264
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,351
And they wind up working more working longer hours on the slow days

265
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
This is not at all what you would expect

266
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
If they were going to follow basic economic Prince

267
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
If they were trying to maximize their hourly pay

268
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,615
You know go the full 11 1/2 hours on the day

269
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
You're raking it in

270
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
And quit early on the day where there's nothing

271
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
To be mad

272
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
And people are doing the exact

273
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Opposite of

274
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,063
They're doing exactly

275
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,135
Sailor called this Behavior mental account

276
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
Taxi drivers

277
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
Or treating each day like it's a different account

278
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
It's a separate bucket

279
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:16,351
And it doesn't matter what happened the day before what's going to happen the day after

280
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
All that matters is the money that you're making too

281
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,007
And we all do this kind of mental Accounting in one way or another

282
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
You know like

283
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
The classic example

284
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:30,175
You spent all year trying to pile up a few thousand dollars couple thousand dollars in your favor

285
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
And then one day your tax refund

286
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
Like

287
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,391
Jeffrey money $2,000 tax refund I'm going to take a trip I'm going to buy a fancy watch

288
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:45,791
Know know that tax money is the same money it's dollars it counts the same towards everything

289
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
And yet we treated differently

290
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
That is mental

291
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
So okay fillers done the classroom work the mugs and stuff

292
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
He said he's real world studies like with

293
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:54,751
The cab drivers

294
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Eventually

295
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
She and other people in the face

296
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
Okay

297
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,663
Now we know all of these ways that people sort of

298
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Self-sabotage

299
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,015
Maybe we can set up the world or at least

300
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
Kind of tweak little corners of it

301
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
To help people get what they want

302
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
So one problem that sailor noticed

303
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
People don't save enough money

304
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,279
Which is literally news to Noah

305
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,583
What's Taylor and his colleagues realized

306
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,423
There might be some really easy things you could do to make it easier to say

307
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
So like when they started looking at this

308
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,335
It was typical when you started a job at a company with like a basic 401K retirement

309
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
You have to sign up

310
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,431
You know you had to say yeah put some of my money in the

311
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
But most people did not

312
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
Sign up so they learn his colleagues said I'd how about that

313
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
When you start a new job

314
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
You're automatically enrolled

315
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Into the 401K

316
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,231
You're going to automatically start contributing it's going to come right out of her

317
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:47,999
Your paycheck

318
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
And if you don't want to contribute

319
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
That's fine

320
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,607
You're just going to have to fill out some paperwork

321
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,631
And then no country

322
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
No big deal just had a huge

323
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
What's more people started country

324
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,799
But this default Optimum contribution was

325
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Very low

326
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,383
Companies with star people off at a very low rate

327
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Not enough not enough

328
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Not enough

329
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,479
Don't

330
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Stop at Throop

331
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,087
So another one of my students Shlomo Ben Arts

332
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
CN I tried to figure out a

333
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
And we called it save mortem

334
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,023
It's great cuz I don't miss I don't have to save more today first of all

335
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
I'm already exactly

336
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
Save more tomorrow means that

337
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
You start out at aloha

338
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
But then when you get a raise down the road

339
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,543
You automatically start saving a bigger and bigger portion of your paycheck

340
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
And all these ideas about retirement

341
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Took off

342
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
Can I say by the way

343
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
Bloomberg News just

344
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Yesterday

345
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,991
Publish the story that

346
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Said

347
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,879
Some 68% of large US companies now automatically enroll employees in 401k

348
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
And

349
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,743
Three-quarters of those employers bump up worker savings rates

350
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
Automatically every year

351
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
That's it

352
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
That's behavioral economics

353
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Enact

354
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,239
These little tweaks like changing the default option to opt-in

355
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
And automatically contributing money

356
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
Taylor and one of his colleagues started calling these

357
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Nudges

358
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
And people in power

359
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,431
They like these

360
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
And all of a sudden

361
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,527
Governments around the world were nudging there

362
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,903
In the UK the government created something that people started calling of the nudge unit switch

363
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,999
Sounds like some you know bad band out of Seattle in 1995 but

364
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
This group

365
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
Did figure out how to get more people to

366
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,143
The organ donors they got more people to pay their taxes on time

367
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:35,007
