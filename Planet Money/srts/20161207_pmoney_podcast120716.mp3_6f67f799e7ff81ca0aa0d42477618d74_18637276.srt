Spothero how can I help you

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,824
Working in a call center is a tough job

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,592
It's true

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:18,432
We visited one in Chicago the call center for this company called spothero

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,992
And it was basically just a bunch of people

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,040
Sitting in a row at a long table store

7
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,064
Anonymous Works B

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,112
And they were just taking call

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:26,880
Call

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:27,904
Call

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,208
Phone up phone down phone up phone down

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,352
And even just hearing their side of the calls you can tell that a lot of people calling in are not happy

13
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:41,216
Let me ask you this is there some joke that goes on

14
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,008
Spothero is a startup

15
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,544
It's this online company that rents out

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,592
Can spaces and people get

17
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
Very emotional

18
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:48,896
About parking

19
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,944
I went yesterday CookieSwirlC

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
Park my car

21
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,064
Did you get that he dated for my appointment

22
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
All I'm asking

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
I just want to be fun

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,024
60 year old man is having to talk to you for now over half an hour.

25
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,400
I really want somebody to call me back that's what I want

26
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:15,008
I would have a nervous breakdown I would just cry all the time

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
Every once in awhile one of the calls is

28
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,384
Truly memorably terrible

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,480
There's one at spothero that people still talk about today it's like a legend

30
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
Making bubbly

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
Took the call it was rude I would Reserve.

32
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
Parking spot but when he got there someone else's

33
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
Making a for standard response

34
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,744
I am so sorry we're young company we have some glitches but

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
I'm here to help

36
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
That was not

37
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,304
Right answer

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,632
I don't know what the right answer was but it was not that the customer started

39
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
Screaming and then he called me

40
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960
A word that

41
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
It's not appropriate for any

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Podcast TV show

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
The c word

44
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,200
Is that why you're telling me story you still look like your hands are shaking a little bit

45
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,760
Megan said she kind of went into shock

46
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:02,112
She put the phone down walked out of the office and started running down the sidewalk

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,416
She ran 13 blocks to Lake

48
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
Adult verbally like

49
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Scream at

50
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
It's a great place to scream

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
When Megan got back she went to talk to her man

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
Women named Julia Pott

53
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
They went into a little conference room

54
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,960
We asked

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
She started crying and

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
She said it's so much

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
And I knew how she felt

58
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,640
Call centers have really high turnover

59
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
Which makes sense

60
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
You're dealing with people who are anxious

61
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,552
And angry and frustrated all day everyday

62
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:38,208
You don't get paid a lot of money and it most companies you're at the bottom of the totem pole you're the person taking customer can

63
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
There's so many times and you

64
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
I just want to throw your headset off a

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
I just say

66
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
I'm done

67
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
And that's when I realized

68
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
I can't let my team have a

69
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544

72
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
It is not just a problem for call center

73
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Hospitals

74
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
Tech companies schools

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
They're all struggling with burnout

76
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
You just really hard to fix

77
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
Companies try

78
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
And most of them fail

79
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:12,000
Today on the show the 26 year-old call center manager tried to beat

80
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,560
Burnouts

81
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,400

The idea of burnout is not that all

92
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,800
The term wasn't even coined until the 1970s

93
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
It's by a guy named Herbert freudenberger

94
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
Psychologists in Manhattan

95
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,224
And he had a practice in a really ritzy area on the Opry

96
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
Practice was doing well it was thriving

97
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
Herbert wasn't satisfied

98
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,904
She was a very serious Driven Man

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
He was Holocaust Survivor

100
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
He fled Germany for the US when he was still just

101
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,327
His child kind of stopped at seven or eight

102
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:24,191
So you really did learn how to play cuz he had then had to grow up pretty quickly and surviving

103
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
New country

104
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,055
That's Herbert's daughter Lisa freudenberger Herbert died in 1999

105
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,359
We met with Lisa in Herbert's old office

106
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,407
She has her own psychology practice there now

107
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
In the states Herbert was taken in by his amp

108
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
She made him sleep in the Attic

109
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
Sitting upright in a chair

110
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,135
Herbert ran away and when he was a teenager he lived on the streets for a while

111
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,487
Gerber Grow Up to become someone who is always pushing himself to help people

112
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
And also to do more

113
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
In addition to his practice on the Upper East Side he opened up a storefront clinic on the Bowery which was New York Skid Row

114
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Any work with drug addict

115
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
These young people were really

116
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Struggling

117
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
Heroin

118
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Cocaine

119
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Acid

120
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,151
They were all becoming big problems back then

121
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
A lot of the kids he was working with words

122
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
Fried he would see them

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,831
Literally holding cigarettes and watch the cigarettes burn out

124
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
Herbert would work from 8 in the morning until

125
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,743
7 at night on the Upper East Side then you go down to the Bowery and work until 2 a.m.

126
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
With thousands of drug addicts

127
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
Filthy little free clinic

128
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,143
He began to get more and more fatigued

129
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,215
And he began to get stressed and he was

130
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:35,615
Not that Pleasant to live with what was that like was he a yeller was here

131
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,199
He had he didn't use his inside voice shall we say so

132
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
Tilly's kids tried to stay out of his way

133
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,063
His wife would say you look tired

134
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
And he'd say what do you want me to do

135
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
Abandon these people

136
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
When Lisa was about 5

137
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Her mom finally said

138
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,023
Enough is enough we are taking the family on vacation

139
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
California

140
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
Plane tickets

141
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
Hotel reservations

142
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Herbert got home

143
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
At 2 a.m. the day of the flight

144
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
And when it came time to wake up

145
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Cape Cod

146
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
He was in bed for 3 days

147
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
He never took that vacation

148
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,711
And that was the moment he started to realize that something was really wrong

149
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,759
But he was a therapist

150
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
He thought maybe he could figure out what was going on with him

151
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,415
So he took a cue from Freud and he started self

152
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Analysis

153
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,511
He would speak into a tape recorder for an hour or two

154
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
And then you take a little break

155
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,071
Kenny been analyzed

156
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
Himself as if he was

157
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
His own doctor

158
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
I don't know how to have fun

159
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
I don't know how to beat you really joyful this is Herbert freudenberger in an interview he did with the Shoah Foundation

160
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
I'm often very

161
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
Sad side

162
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
Play has not gotten me through

163
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
Something that I've avoided

164
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
I've never known how to do it

165
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
That's been hurtful

166
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
That's hurt me

167
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,207
Herbert realized what he was feeling

168
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Wasn't just exhaustion

169
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
It was not exactly depression

170
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
It was something else

171
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:03,679
It has to do with how hard he was working how much he cared about his job and the fact

172
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
Didn't always feel like he was making a

173
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,543
Prince he was diagnosing something new

174
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
And he needed a word for

175
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,431
So his mind went to those drug addicts that he worked with down on the Bowery with

176
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Their blank look

177
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Cigarettes

178
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Burning out

179
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
He called his illness

180
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:21,855
Burnout the same word that drug addicts use to describe themselves

181
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
See what a book about it

182
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
Burnout

183
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
High-cost

184
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
Of high achievement

185
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
And the concept

186
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,767
Totally took off all of these stressed out

187
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Social workers

188
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Doctors

189
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,119
Housewives of lawyers for like I have that

190
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
He felt like he was talking to them

191
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:40,031
But he was doing these radio shows around the country he was doing TV shows

192
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,663
Monday asked me how to wear makeup I was little worried

193
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,735
I like what's 14U makeup for kids

194
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:53,599
Is like well I think the Rings under my eyes a little dark I'm like so you need under eye cover

195
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
The TV

196
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,719
Herbert went on Oprah Phil Donahue

197
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
He met with President Jimmy Carter about burnout

198
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:07,679
He even came on NPR in 1981 are you forgetting appointments and deadlines are you increasingly irritable

199
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
Depressed fatigue

200
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,031
You may be suffering from burnout

201
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:18,687
NPR was going through like a psychedelic space Bernard Williams response to

202
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:25,087
The stress response to frustration it's a response to a demand that an individual my makeup on them self and turn

203
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,951
Pay requirements for protectionism or drive

204
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,255
Herbert became a burnout Guru

205
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
His book was a hit

206
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Burnout

207
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,607
With officially a thing

208
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:42,495
But also not officially a thing because burnout never made it into the DSM that's the

209
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,335
Official listing of mental disorders from the American Psychiatric Association

210
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,175
In 240 years later companies are struggling with that

211
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
If I go to HR and say I'm burned out

212
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
There's no protocol

213
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
Still treated like an individual problem

214
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,623
Like no elsbernd. She should take a personal day

215
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
Not like there's a problem with the workplace

216
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,487
Insult people are left alone

217
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
I get depressed they start missing work

218
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,095
But while you pocket was talking to Megan bubble

219
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
About that terrible call sheet

220
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
We thought

221
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,959
This is a workplace problem

222
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
I'm going to fix it

223
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,567
Yes she did Leah is like a mix of head cheerleader and

224
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
In class

225
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:23,199
She radiates confidence she's always smiling so he's taking spin classes

226
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
And we should say Leah works

227
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,295
But off she will take calls on her days off

228
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
I just remember

229
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
Wedding I was at a year-and-a-half ago

230
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,415
Because I spent

231
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Better

232
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,767
Part of the wedding in the lobby on the phone with a customer

233
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,815
I couldn't remember where I parked

234
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
I did my

235
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
So the first thing she did was something

236
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Obvious

237
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,519
She cut down the number of calls or people were take

238
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,311
It was not uncommon

239
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
Seriously not uncommon

240
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
Someone doing over a hundred calls

241
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
IRS2Go

242
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
And

243
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:03,391
Let him know that if you're okay with people taking a hundred calls and feeling burned out you're going to have high attrition

244
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
Did you have to fight for that

245
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
I'm trying to imagine like

246
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,279
Finally the CEO said okay

247
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
You can have a few more employees

248
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,679
And that made a big difference to people's workloads down from 90 hundred calls a day

249
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
More like 60 call today

250
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:22,847
But burnout is about more than workload and research has proven this again and again and again

251
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,455
Tulia went into phase two of her beat burnout plan

252
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
Give people capes and call them Heroes

253
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
That is not

254
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
A metaphor

255
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
It's not

256
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:39,487
When we did our very first hero day we bought capes and had everyone wear capes really got into it

257
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,559
I know where's our case

258
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,399
At the call center workers at spothero are referred to as

259
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Gyros

260
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,959
In addition to heroic

261
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,031
Appreciation day we started organizing a whole bunch of social of a

262
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
Bowling Happy Hours Pizza lunches

263
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,615
Talent show

264
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
Somebody the people taking customer complaint calls

265
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
Like the cool kids

266
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
They were doing all the fun stuff

267
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
They were the people having the best

268
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,903
We also wanted a place where people could go after a hard call

269
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,719
Sushi tuck this corner of the office and she

270
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,071
He converted it into a destress area called the shake.it.off area

271
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
After

272
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Taylor Swift

273
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
It was stress balls

274
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,215
It was a corset a picture of Taylor Swift

275
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,775
I'm so walking over there was

276
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
But you know

277
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
A signal to everyone else

278
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,407
Hey I just got off of work really hard call I'm feeling

279
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
It right now

280
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
That sounds a little

281
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,551
Yeah I am going to jump a little cheese

282
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
The right but it worked

283
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,927
It's for employees like Megyn Kelly the woman who took that really terrible call

284
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:48,095
The biggest Testament do I want to be here I have not had one day where I woke up and I was like I can't go into the office today I don't want to go into

285
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
What's today like

286
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,727
Being able to wake up and not invite not have the Sunday scaries so we always joke about like

287
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,263
Because all my friends are at the office

288
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,799
What am I going to do if I'm at home

289
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Styx

290
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
Edwin spothero move to new building

291
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
We got the CEO to take the

292
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Shake It Off area

293
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
Can you tell me where are we right now

294
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,343
So right now we're sitting in this spot hero Zen Den

295
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
The Zen Den

296
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Coloring books

297
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
Sand garden with little scraper

298
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,767
Big pouch sort of soothing colors everywhere

299
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,559
You got very into something called the

300
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,423
Buddha Board with anything with water and then it vanishes

301
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Okay but, we were both a little bit skeptical

302
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Why does zen room

303
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,687
Like why do you need this and why can't you just be like okay you're taking a hundred calls were going to have you take

304
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
670

305
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Where's the fun in that

306
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Then

307
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,575
Maybe they won't be burned out

308
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
How much work they have

309
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
But they'll be burnt out emotionally from

310
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
Feeling kind of like

311
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Empty or not

312
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
Really thinking their work matters when

313
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
The birthday do is just

314
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:50,815
So

315
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
So important

316
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
The work they do is just so

317
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
So

318
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Important

319
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,775
And this seems to be the final key

320
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
We Believe

321
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Actually believe

322
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,919
Did the people who work in the call center are making the world

323
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Better place

324
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,295
And she has somehow convinced everyone else at the company that this is the case

325
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,135
Executives the app developers the marketing team

326
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
Everybody it's bajirao is like

327
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Fast with their call center

328
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,839
Truly we talked to one employee Margo conroe's and we tried to see if we could get her to

329
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
It's absolute reference

330
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,959
I mean we call them Heroes and we feel like

331
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
They are the heroes

332
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
The rest of us are trying to make a good product

333
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
And help our company grow

334
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,687
The customer heroes are on the front lines making those

335
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,551
You know those minut improvements to humanity all the time all day everyday

336
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
I mean you guys are an app that sells parking space

337
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,439
You're talkin about a department that

338
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,303
Is pretty minor in the grand scheme of your app

339
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
And

340
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,935
Which I see head-shaking by missing keep going and which a lot of companies take care of

341
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
With a website

342
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
Like frequently asked questions

343
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,335
And you're talking about Humanity that is really

344
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Weird

345
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,199
I mean we think of them as another Heroes of the company

346
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
Because they're

347
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
You know

348
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
Heroes for individual

349
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,111
Humans are there in the world

350
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
But they just a customer complaints

351
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Do they know

352
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
She was not going to break

353
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
Maybe she should because here's the thing

354
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,887
This culture that we are created at spothero

355
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
I said a pretty powerful

356
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Result

357
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
Spothero call center has

358
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
0

359
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
Turn over nobody is quitting

360
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
And it's been this way for years

361
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
We haven't had

362
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
Anyone full-time leave

363
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
You know the

364
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
I actually honestly hadn't thought about it

365
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
Actual number

366
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,927
Was really next to zero companies are taking a similar approach

367
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,511
The Mayo Clinic is in a series of studies on burnout at

368
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,351
Problem for doctors and now male sponsors dinners were doctors

369
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Convened

370
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,447
And bond and it started workplace training that helps people deal with stress

371
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,519
The important thing is that companies are naming it

372
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
This is burnout

373
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,127
That also turned out to be the key for Herbert freudenberger

374
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,943
Burnout Guru who was so fried he couldn't get out of bed

375
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,039
That and recognition and respect that he got for his work

376
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
His daughter Lisa says he's

377
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
Still worked Around the Clock

378
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,671
But he was able to enjoy his life

379
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,023
More when Lisa was about 9 he actually went on a family vacation

380
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
They went to Lake Carmel in Upstate New York

381
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
And there's her dad

382
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
Who was never not in a suit and tie

383
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Wearing

384
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Swimming trunks

385
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,543
And she realized he was like a different person

386
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,639
Come let me let me show you how I swim let me show you how I swim

387
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
He then got into the lake

388
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
And he proceeded to do a dead man's float

389
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,343
Waiting to see any flapping of the arms are flapping of the legs or

390
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Something

391
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,903

392
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
Got up with a

393
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,743
Biggest Granite I could see like this little boy

394
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,535
This inner child and I'm just
