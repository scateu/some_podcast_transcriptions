00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:21,760
The other day I got an invitation that I wasn't expecting

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,040
It was from Walmart

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,624
In the past Walmart hasn't been the most open

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
Company safe

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
Famously kept the card

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,696
Cluster test

12
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,768
But for the last year they've been working on something

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:36,608
Project they wanted to tell the world about

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
And so I flew down there

15
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
Their headquarters

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960
In Bentonville Ark

17
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:47,872
At this is Julia at Walmart it is I get there and I'm introduced to a guy named Jack

18
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
Pastello

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,432
Konjac

20
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
Hi

21
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,992
Jack is in charge of Walmart

22
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,296
Culinary and Innovation Center

23
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,832
He walks me over this table

24
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
Brothers

25
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,904
Plate and on it is one of these

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
Culinary innovation

27
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,768
It is a bright red a pickle

28
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,560
It is a bright

29
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:11,936
Red decal and it's got a lot of fruit punch loaded unless you get if you pickle it with fruit punch

30
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,800
Walmart would like the world to know it is creating a tropical fruit punch

31
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Petco

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
They call this

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
The traffic

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,504
Jack says it's actually inspired by similar pickles you might find in BBQ joints in Mississippi

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,784
And you like me to try it

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,344
I can probably just cut it with a spark

37
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,232
I'm not sure

47

Amazon

These two companies are in a battle to be the place where we buy everything

49
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
And today on the show

50
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
How it may all come down

00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,960
This is Charles Fishman

Ocala

65
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,896
He's an author and reporter he wrote a book called The Wal-Mart effect

66
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,456
And he says that when Walmart first started

67
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,992
Food was not part of the

68
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,600
The first Walmart opened in 1962 in Rogers Arkansas

69
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:10,208
And the founder Sam Walton's plan was to sell all the other everyday stuff

70
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
Like toothpaste like laundry detergent

71
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
Like diapers

72
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
But

73
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
To sell those things

74
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
Cheaper than anybody else

75
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,168
And a sell everything cheap

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,704
The company had to

77
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
BG

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Sam Walton was

79
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
Legendarily

80
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,152
There's a story in trousers book about one of the company offices

81
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,456
Peach all that money for a desk

82
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,784
Chair but the chairs for the gas were

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Lawn chairs

84
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,880
That ain't another supplier had brought a sample

85
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Laugh

86
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,208
So instead of buying office furniture

87
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,024
Sam was like head the guy left your lawn chairs let's use them

88
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
And sure it's a funny story

89
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
But

90
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
As Walmart grew and grew

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,544
It got really good at these kinds of things that at inventive ways to save money and then sell stuff

92
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Ridiculously

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
At one point Walmart decided to

94
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
Only carry concentrated detergent fruit

95
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
Cut down on shipping and plastic

96
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
And of course

97
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Cost

98
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
It also decided to make it

99
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
Proceed shorter

100
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,880
It seems $7000000

101
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
A year

102
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:16,256
And they were known for not paying their employees very well

103
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,303
You gotten better on this but it's

104
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
Definitely a part of their cost-cutting hit

105
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
For better for worse though

106
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,959
These Cost Cuts resulted in big savings

107
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
Customer

108
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Savings

109
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,871
And by 1988 virtually every state in the country had a war

110
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,455
Sam understood that if he was going to grow

111
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
He was already selling as much

112
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Toothpaste

113
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,575
As much deodorant as many things like

114
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,927
Athletic socks that people buy and then we're out and then buy again

115
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,071
As as you can sell and you look around it's not hard to say what aren't we selling

116
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,399
Well we aren't selling milk and bread and chicken breast

117
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,959
And if we sell those things

118
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,263
We we change the game for ourselves

119
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,055
Until Walmart decides

120
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,335
To take on groceries

121
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,871
It started opening these

122
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,431
Supercenters that are basically Walmart

123
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Grocery store attached

124
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,319
Intern says that even though the existing grocery industry was this big

125
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Well oiled machine

126
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
It did not matter

127
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,183
Because in just ten years

128
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,975
Walmart had devastated the

129
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
When

130
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,583
A Supercenter opened near you as a grocery store

131
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,631
You immediately lost

132
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,959
The equivalent of a whole day sales each week

133
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
You lost one seventh of your sales

134
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,055
24

135
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,103
Regional grocery chains went bankrupt

136
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,639
As Wal-Mart rolled out across

137
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
Really yes

138
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
And they knew what they were doing

139
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,759
They were the number one seller of grocery

140
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
In the United States

141
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,951
Charles leader told us that he actually check that number and it was even more chance it went bankrupt because of Walmart it was 27

142
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
And in essence

143
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
Walmart became a different

144
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Company

145
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
With cross

146
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Speakers

147
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,447
Selling food meant that people just needed the store in a totally different way

148
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,263
People go to the grocery store once a week or twice a week

149
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
And by the way

150
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
If you're in the Walmart

151
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
To do a quick grocery shop

152
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
The grocery aisles of course a butt

153
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,503
The rest of the store the clothing

154
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
The underwear that light bulbs

155
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
And so you may just say oh I'm here

156
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
We need light bulbs let me go grab them

157
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,743
With the addition of groceries Walmart started making even more money

158
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,583
And eventually became the biggest company in the history of

159
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
The world

160
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
The biggest by Revenue

161
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,751
Last year Walmart made around 480 billion

162
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Dollars

163
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,311
Half a trillion dollars

164
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
In Revenue

165
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Which is to say that

166
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,175
There are now half a trillion reasons

167
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
For Walmart to do everything it can

168
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,295
To defend its grocery Empire

169
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Against

170
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
I don't know what to say

171
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
A company from Seattle

172
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
Who really wants to sell gross

173
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
We are getting some breaking news on Whole Food

174
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Such a game-changer

175
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
Amazon to buy Whole Foods

176
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
This is about 6 months ago and I think part of the shock that day

177
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
Was it not very long ago at all

178
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,639
Amazon was this website that just sold book

179
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
And holy cow

180
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,991
Now they're buying grocery stores

181
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
But the reality is

182
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
This kind of world domination

183
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,903
It was sort of baked into the identity of the company from the begin

184
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
Back in 19 it must have been 1995

185
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
They were

186
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,791
Discussing what to call Amazon

187
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,887
This is bradstone he wrote a biography about Jeff Bezos called

188
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
The everything

189
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,751
And they did register URLs like book mall.com

190
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,871
But he very clearly chose a name that had nothing to do with books that conveyed

191
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:50,015
A principle which was like the largest in the world the Amazon the largest river in the world the largest selection in the

192
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
The ambition was great even back

193
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,879
Brett says they also considered the name

194
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
Relentless.com even back then

195
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Besos

196
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
Has Walmart

197
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,023
Mine

198
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
He's reading and underlining the autobiography

199
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Sam Walton

200
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
Gets copies to

201
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
Play score

202
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Wisdom

203
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,215
In about ten years after starting the company

204
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,799
Bezos comes to the exact same realization that Sam Walton

205
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
In order to sell everything to everyone

206
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,407
You have to make the leap

207
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
Into selling food

208
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,503
They launched the service called Amazon Fresh

209
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:28,415
Excited I have my first-ever delivery

210
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Amazon

211
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,047
Sign out here there is an entire YouTube category

212
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,607
Of people receiving difference Amazon Fresh

213
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,911
Is a total rabbit-hole stay away we weren't

214
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,215
Many people were very excited

215
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,943
Giant sweet potatoes

216
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
Other people

217
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
Not as excited

218
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,319
I think it's the last time than Amazon Prime fresh

219
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,159
This because this guy his entire order was basically crushed when you got

220
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,511
What's this box of cereal.

221
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Damn C

222
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Brew

223
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
Everything's like that

224
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,679
What Amazon learned pretty quickly is that delivering groceries is

225
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Way more complicated

226
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
Then delivering a pair of socks

227
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Sucks don't go bad

228
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
And so Amazon's first crack at groceries

229
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
It didn't really go that well

230
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
Certainly

231
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
We should also say that

232
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,295
Walmart by revenue is still way bigger than him

233
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
You can still imagine

234
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Walmart

235
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,647
Is watching all of this from Arkansas

236
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
I'm still worried

237
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
Because Amazon has a ton of money

238
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,327
And eventually it did figure out a way to sell groceries well

239
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,119
Just buy

240
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Whole Foods

241
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Holy cow

242
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
Once Amazon bought Whole Foods

243
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:48,543
Immediately drop food prices and they drew a bunch of new customer

244
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,895
One survey showed about one-in-four of those new Amazon Whole Foods shoppers

245
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Came over from wall

246
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
And so Walmart is at a place

247
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
Where needs to get to Shoppers back

248
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
One way to do that

249
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
Used to sell food

250
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
The Amazon

251
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Can't possibly have

252
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
The kind of food

253
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
You might have to invent

254
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
In a secret Laboratory

255
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
Hidden in Bentonville Ark

256
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,655
Which is how I ended up going down to Walmart's headquarters

257
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
See what they're up to

258
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,007
And I'm imagining like this impenetrable Fortress

259
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,799
You know serious cigars it's

260
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
The front door

261
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
But nope

262
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,063
Blakeman a very enthusiastic employee of Walmart

263
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,367
We're at the front desk of Walmart head

264
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,975
Paris and she give me a pass to get through security there a couple levels of clearance

265
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
If you're just going to the vendor rooms here at that battle get you to that but you're going to pass that you'll need it the second one

266
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,679
Yes

267
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,287
Julie did they give you top clearance at Walmart I mean I don't know I don't know how high it goes but

268
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,847
I feel pretty good about it anyways

269
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,663
It's enough to get me back into the Walmart

270
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,735
Where there's a bunch of buildings they all look like Walmart

271
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,271
And eventually

272
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,599
We end up over at The Culinary and Innovations

273
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
Inside we walk down this

274
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,975
Hall where there's a bunch of identical kitchens that are meant to

275
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
Just look like you know

276
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,279
Average home kitchen

277
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,095
And this is where I meet Victorville I

278
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,447
Hi

279
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,079
Victor is one of a bunch of people who are trying to think up and invent entirely new

280
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
From Walmart

281
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,895
Please tell me he's in a lab coat

282
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,479
At now will more Silicon Valley than that something like

283
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
Patagonia

284
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
Soft shell

285
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,111
Do you know what that picture like a soft coat or light coat

286
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Soft coat

287
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,207
I don't know anyway this is job is

288
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
To create

289
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
Brand new kind of

290
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
PS4 Walmart

291
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,887
What were sitting there he pulls these little plastic bags out of his pocket

292
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Full

293
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Effete

294
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,847
We got wet but you scared to see some of these seeds are for a new tomato

295
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,895
I was at Walmart can ship long distances

296
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
But it still tastes really good

297
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
Sommerford Brandy

298
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
Cantaloupe they named it

299
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
The sweet Spark

300
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,343
Which is sweet even in the winter apparently a big problem

301
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Cantaloupe

302
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,927
And the rest of the seeds were a new kind

303
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Watermelon

304
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,255
Is watermelon is actually yellow skin

305
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
It's striped

306
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,631
In the bright red inside and the flavor is

307
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Unbelievable

308
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,983
He says the yellow color was actually an accident

309
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,055
But it does also give them a Competitive Edge

310
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,383
When a piece of fruit or vegetable looks odd

311
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,175
I didn't at first

312
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
You know it

313
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
People really have to try hard enough to get to taste it

314
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
But if we put Demos in the stores and they love it

315
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
And that becomes your best friend

316
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,231
Because your kid will tell you Mommy bring me the yellow watermelon that I love

317
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
Easy to recognize

318
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:54,911
This yellow watermelon is potentially exactly the kind of weapon they'll need in the food fight with Amazon

319
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
Because it will be found

320
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
Exclusively at Walmart

321
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,055
I keep thinking like imagine

322
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
You could only buy something

323
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
Like a baby carrot

324
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
At Walmart

325
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
But that would be a huge

326
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,783
If you're a parent and you have to go to Walmart

327
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
To buy baby

328
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
Carrots may as well buy your socks

329
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
Tattoo and toothpaste

330
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
And everything else you might need

331
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
Hand soap Walmart is in search

332
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,767
Of the next baby carrot and it started to put

333
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
Systems in place to

334
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
Testis as they invent

335
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
They have a laboratory

336
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Call the center

337
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,447
I went over there after seeing Victor and

338
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
And the way the testing works

339
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Expensive guitar

340
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
New watermelon say

341
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
Is it hundreds of employees

342
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Come through

343
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
The sensory lab and they taste it

344
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
And then there were eight

345
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,039
Turn on the damn there there are a bunch of things coming through

346
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:43,807
Protest test

347
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,855
I've been through them it with an employee

348
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,975
So we're going to do that

349
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,255
There's a whole route

350
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,303
NH Booth you sit

351
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
You face the wall

352
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,911
And then one by one these food inventions come out from this

353
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
Slots in the

354
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,287
Start with beautiful water to cleanse your palate Force

355
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,895
What were sitting there in the booth Reggie explain to me how this is going to work

356
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Doodle timeout

357
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,247
Taste it and then he'll write it on a scale from

358
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Dislike extremely

359
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Till like

360
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,159
First step out pop some Greek yogurts Reggie taste it and then

361
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,231
That's really good

362
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
There's a lemon poppy seed

363
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,095
This one I liked very much. Say

364
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,191
A chicken poblano burrito bowl

365
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Some onion bread

366
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
I know you like very much

367
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,823
Are you generally pretty positive guy ready

368
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Hemisphere

369
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Cersei

370
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
But you have to be nowadays folks

371
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
Pictures of no testing

372
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,087
Any breakthroughs as big as say

373
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,647
The tropical fruit punch pickle

374
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
Can't have a tropical everyday

375
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,279
But there has been some pretty groundbreaking research

376
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
Birthday cake flavored oatmeal

377
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Okay

378
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
The cotton candy grape

379
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
Would be delighted to hear that someone finally understand him and I didn't get to taste those those are not quite in

380
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,919
And what struck me while I was visiting the culinary and Innovation Center

381
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,015
Was that this grocery war between Amazon and Walmart has reached

382
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Almost

383
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Point

384
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
Amazon is buying actual

385
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
Stores Walmart is inventing

386
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
Grapes

387
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
And it's all part of this

388
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Bigger battle

389
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
Tubidy a store that sells everything

390
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,327
To everyone

391
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,863
What creates a whole new problem

392
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,679
Because what is the difference between two stores

393
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
That both sell everything

394
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,751
Why do you go to one person

395
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
The other how do you even choose

396
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,847
Annie's company seem to understand

397
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,919
What this means is that they need special stuff

398
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
Anything

399
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
You can offer that the other one

400
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Speaking of which

401
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,319
I'm going to go grab something

402
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
Julia is leaving the studio

403
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
I'm waiting studio for Julia

404
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
She has left

405
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Leftist Julia

406
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,863
Dawn has Julia Julie's coming back

407
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Acting studio

408
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,215

Kenny I want people to know what

418
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Fish tropical

419
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Tropical

420
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,943
I obviously tried it I also tried it

421
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
But it tastes like a salty

422
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,015
Capri Sun

423
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,575
But we realized we have no idea what to make

424
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,879
Got the tropical and so we brought in

425
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
Seafood expert

426
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,719
My name is Dan pashman podcast

427
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,743
Call the sporkful

428
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,071
Yes I certainly have that something that we would like you to try

429
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
It is a

430
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
Recent development of Walmart

431
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
Official I can just tell you it looks

432
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
Looks like Maraschino pickles

433
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
That's what it looks like

434
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
It is called

435
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Tropical

436
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,615
Here we go about her bite

437
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
It's very sweet

438
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,831
Could you imagine eating barbecue and and then in

439
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
Enjoying this as a side or like

440
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
I could actually

441
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,743
I couldn't because Dan said that the tropical reminded him of this food concept

442
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
Called the sweet

443
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,839
Doubt that he learned about while he was at a barbecue joint

444
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
In Centerville Tennessee

445
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
So we finished our barbecue lunch

446
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,215
We're having cake and pie

447
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
They left the barbecue on the table

448
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,847
After we're finished with dessert

449
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
My host said to me

450
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
Now it's time for

451
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,479
For the sweet out have one more Taste of salty BBQ

452
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,783
After the desert

453
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,111
And the barbecue was

454
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
Even better than beef

455
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,439
Exit tasted saltier and smoke here

456
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,231
After having just

457
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
The carrot cake in the chess pie

458
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
And

459
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,631
What what disease

460
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Tropicals are making me crave

461
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:22,591
Is some pulled pork more weird food

462
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
