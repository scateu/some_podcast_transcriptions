When it comes to investing

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,912
We all have Quest

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,472
And investor.gov has answers

6
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,776

Ghosting

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,992
The other day you and I went to Walmart

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,832
We got Peppers apples

13
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
Bread

14
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,880
I got a Halloween card

15
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,184
We are there cuz we're doing a story about self

16
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,000
We wanted to find out could we make it

17
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,536
Through self-checkout

18
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,840
One time just one time

19
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
Without getting some kind of

20
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
Error message

21
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,448
We were there with Howard Schneider

22
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,240
He lives a couple blocks away from this

23
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
Particular Walmart

24
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,896
And we were shopping there with him because he's kind of an expert on self checkout

25
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:54,528
It was Pucci right everything was going fine

26
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,832
Until we hit the red bell pepper

27
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,880
Maybe it's under red

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,720
You're scrolling through the pages looking for the right thing

29
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,512
Red peppers

30
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,072
D4 bell pepper

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,864
No peppers

32
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:14,496
It was not be for Bell Peppers doesn't even say what to do so then you're stuck here right now

33
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,288
Does even say get help or anything

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,640
And Felton would probably still be standing there trying to figure this out

35
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:27,040
But for the fact that Howard went and got a store employee who walked over and saved us by typing in the code for pepper

36
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,832
She just knew the number in Iran

37
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,928
The fact that the we have to call the attendant to process is little order

38
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
Expense is a failure really shouldn't happen and the Machine should deal with situations like that and why is self checkout a big

39
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Guilty you

40
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,424
Because I invented it right one when did they

41
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592

Before we went shopping at Walmart with Howard Stern

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
We went to his office to me

62
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
He's a doctor you practice Tai Chi

63
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,816
And his office is in this old shopping mall on the edge of Toronto

64
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,936
What he was telling us how to get there he said okay my office is upstairs from The Pickle Barrel restaurant

65
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,752
And Brake near this room where people come to play cards

66
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
It sprinkled Hazel's Bridge

67
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Think is that

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Hello

69
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,504
Is that there is a computer

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
It says please check in here

71
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
Snow person

72
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
Flight self check in

73
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,952
There's the standard beige counter where the receptionist with normal

74
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
There's no reception

75
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
There's no paper

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Tablet computer facing

77
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
Yes so we go up to that computer

78
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,144
Start popping through the check-in

79
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
Please answer questions before you see doctor

80
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Schneider

81
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
Do you have an appointment this person yes

82
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,872
I have told the person.

83
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,968
Is a great to see you and or interact with you please wait a few seconds

84
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Okay

85
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
And then Howard Walker

86
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,064
Hello hello

87
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,208
How are things late 50s he's got glasses curly hair

88
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
Black pants black polo

89
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Blue Spa

90
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,096
And there's something about Howard we like you can tell there's

91
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,912
There's this gap between what's going on on the outside

92
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
And what's going on in his head

93
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
There's alot going on in

94
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Yeah

95
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,056
So we started out with those those initial to cry

96
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:02,944
How did the doctor invent self-checkout innosphere time and Nick your question why does self checkout

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Still suck

98
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,248
And now I got another

99
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Which is

100
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
Why is the guy who invented self check

101
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,136
Check out this thing used in grocery stores all around the world

102
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,976
Was he working in a little office across from a bridge club in an old Mall in

103
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,815
We crowded into this room behind the empty receptionist area

104
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
And Howard told us

105
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
He said he always liked playing with computers tinkering with stuff

106
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,263
It was MIT studying engineering then came back to Canada for med school

107
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,567
He wound up working in an emergency room

108
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
Singh psychiatry

109
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
I'd see an average for boat

110
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
810 ambulances

111
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247
Sometimes walk-ins in in the yard per day

112
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:42,623
You don't need start really started you start thinking I mean you know what's really what's going on in the brain

113
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Have you seen all this psychiatry

114
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
If he starts thinking about

115
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,255
Cognition about what it means to think

116
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,303
At the same time you still interested in

117
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,071
Computers

118
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
Suigetsu this side project

119
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Start

120
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
Dreaming up a computer that can think

121
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
And this isn't just some like abstract age

122
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Actually

123
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:04,127
Lights out in like great detail his plan for how this is going to

124
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Silicon-based circuitry

125
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,759
Interconnected by 5 billion vertical interconnecting wires

126
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,319
You say 5 billion wires

127
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,415
5 billion vertical wires but there's trillions of other wires

128
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
He submits this paper to this big NASA conference and his paper gets accepted he flies down to DC talk to a bunch of really smart

129
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Scientist

130
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
But there's one problem

131
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
So is this a thing anyone could actually built

132
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
It hasn't been built yet essentially even though he's written it all down this is still some wild idea of some

133
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,383
Computer with

134
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,455
Williams of wires and you know it's just a dream

135
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
It's frustrating I mean Howard is a tinker

136
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
You know he likes

137
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,367
Building stuff he wants to come up with something that he can actually build in the real world

138
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
Around this time it's a ladies

139
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
ATMs are starting to be wise

140
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,559
And IBM in these other companies besides they're going to solve the next big problem

141
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Grocery store checkout

142
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
At the Howard it's like this weird challenge that he

143
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
He takes kind of person

144
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
He goes and tells his wife

145
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
This is my big project

146
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:11,199
My wife says you've never even gone to the grocery refuse to go shopping your you hate you you get very upset going to shopping malls

147
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
Howard our hero is not deterred

148
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,575
He walks over to his neighborhood Supermarket to get some date

149
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
And I had a clipboard

150
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,231
I had a stopwatch mechanical want you got the mechanical stopwatch like tick tick tick tick tick

151
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
Sitting here at the supermarket

152
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,607
Supermarket cashier isn't just some simple robot like

153
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,191
Being a cashier is more complicated than it seems

154
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
Supermarkets are missing varmints you have things for the barcodes your produce you have people trying to steal things people

155
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
Give me this make change do this

156
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,175
And that's a huge

157
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,735
Leap and cognition to go from Banking Machine

158
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,527
Replacing the person in the supermarket

159
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Power thought

160
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
Okay this is difficult

161
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,647
But it's also exciting

162
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
Here's the thing I can actually build

163
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:59,839
And it combines all the cognition stuff that I've been thinking about the hospital and all the computer stuff that

164
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
I've been working on his well

165
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
So he said to work

166
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,727
Takes all the money that him and his wife have saved up

167
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
About $50,000 at the time

168
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
It starts to build a prototype

169
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
And some pieces are pretty faithful

170
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
You know reading barcodes

171
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Scanner

172
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
Taking a payment there's a machine that does that meant to do those things

173
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,343
A computer doesn't need to be aware

174
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
You know it just needs to do with a computer does

175
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
But there is a place where the computer

176
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Does need to be

177
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Doesn't

178
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
Yeah it's Steph

179
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,655
Right people steal is here I'm just going to walk out with half the stuff in my car

180
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,959
This is a very hard

181
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
Technical design problem

182
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
You know it's like if you're building this machine you got the sort of

183
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Diles youku

184
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Contritely

185
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
You can make it

186
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,479
Really easy to steal stuff and then people are just going to

187
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,831
Fuel stuff or you can make it really hard to steal stuff but then you're going to end up

188
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,159
Using lots of honest people of trying to steal stuff

189
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,463
Why I hate

190
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
Self checkout right

191
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,071
It's that live unexpected item in the bag

192
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
Area that phrases

193
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
Burned into my memory

194
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
And then

195
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,983
Then there's that moment right

196
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,127
Just shopping and there's a big lot of people behind you and you're trying to find red bell pepper on that little

197
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
But you just want to be done so you pick

198
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Green pepper

199
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,247
You might save a buck

200
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
And is it stealing

201
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
I don't know

202
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
Yes yes

203
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,623
Feel it still

204
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,439
Howard Schneider is confronting all of these

205
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Problems

206
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
She's trying to build a

207
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
And people around this time have already for

208
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,607
Figured out that you can put a scale in the bagging area

209
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Try to prevent

210
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,983
Yeah and the reason behind that is simple right they want to make sure that people

211
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,311
Don't put stuff in their bags and walk away with them that they haven't scared

212
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,919
It's a simple idea but Howard found that it's a really hard technical problem to solve

213
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,735
Afrofuturism partly it's because

214
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:56,063
Stuff at the grocery store comes in this huge range of weight

215
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Esl greeting cards

216
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
Hyundai South 40 lb of flour or potatoes

217
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
So how it has a scale

218
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,999
Custom built that can handle everything

219
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,047
But even then he has another problem

220
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,119
And that's that the weight of the same kind of items

221
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
Lincoln Berry

222
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
You know the loaves of bread they make at the store

223
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:16,287
A little bit bigger or heavier on some days in a little bit later on other day

224
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,871
Howard programs is machine to figure this out to

225
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
You actually learn as it goes along

226
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,271
How to machine seen the loaf of bread a few times and realizes wow bread can

227
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,087
Sorry on the other hand Coca-Cola they're pretty good

228
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,159
The Coke cans are within you know within with anagrammer to each time

229
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
It's not perfect

230
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
Obviously but it's good enough

231
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
He puts it all together

232
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,071
The good enough scale the scanner the monitor

233
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
And he's got his machine

234
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,887
He's ready for it to take over the

235
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,191
Howard showed us a picture of this

236
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
August 1st machine

237
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,775
And it's really striking it looks almost

238
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,591
Exactly like self-checkout machines still look today

239
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:56,735
Howard still doesn't quit his day job you still working at the ER but he does turn his self-checkout hobby into an actual come

240
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,831
He calls it optimal robotics very nineties any starts going around

241
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
Pictures of groceries

242
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,183
To get the meeting at a New England supermarket chain called

243
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Stop & Shop

244
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
So he drives down

245
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,303
Give this presentation in this board room full of

246
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
And at the head of the table there's this execu

247
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Who everybody is looking

248
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,471
This old guy sitting at the head of a table on you know he's his son

249
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
You know why people shop at Stop & Shop I said no he says

250
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,079
Because of our people

251
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:28,223
Because we're people that everybody around the table starts nodding their head and he says do you think people want to come in

252
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
And speaker machine

253
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:36,159
Do you know anything about retail you know anything and he says I don't think it's for us and everybody around the table not of the

254
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Their head

255
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,767
And I drove back to Montreal with my tail between my legs and it was just

256
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,839
Horrible feeling thinking this is the stupidest thing I've ever done

257
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Nobody will ever lie

258
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
Like it or ever use it

259
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
But Howard keeps

260
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,239
Loading his machine into the back of this rented Ryder truck

261
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Keep throwing a supermarket trade shows

262
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,127
And eventually he gets a meeting with a supermarket chain called Price Chopper

263
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
Spaced in Upstate New

264
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
It needs a head person actually saw the machine

265
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,039
I need to know he said he looked at he says I like it

266
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
What's the weather

267
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,135
And I guess what after that everybody is very nice

268
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
CEO says

269
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
We're not going to buy the machines

270
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
But you can use one of our stores in Upstate New York

271
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
As a real world

272
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
And on August

273
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,119
V 1990

274
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
U2

275
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
Grocery store shoppers use

276
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
What maybe

277
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,311
Depending on your definition I mean we what we are going to call

278
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,335
The first

279
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
Fully automatic self check

280
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,455
What Howard gets to the supermarket that day

281
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,991
He sees that there are protests

282
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Who's there

283
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
It's the cashiers Union

284
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
They're saying

285
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,087
These machines are

286
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
Taking our jobs

287
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,695
How to rid of this quotation from a union rep at a time

288
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
Immune rap basically said

289
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
The thing that I think about all the time

290
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,607
These machines are forcing customers to do more

291
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
Quote maybe if the customers come early

292
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,727
They can unload the truck and stock the shelves

293
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
No I mean like

294
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,847
There is a serious question underneath it right which is like

295
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Are these machines taking people's jobs

296
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
But but

297
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:07,039
The answer is very anticlimactic let me tell you what happened at Price Chopper the machines went in people use them

298
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
And they didn't work

299
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
It crashed

300
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,183
It stopped working and then people have shopping carts half unloaded and everything

301
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
The story is full of angry shopper

302
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
And Howard

303
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,375
He just sitting there in the middle of all this chaos unscrewing the back of the machine

304
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
So that he can restart it

305
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,983
And the union they figure they've got nothing to worry about

306
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
They pack up their protest

307
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
And weave

308
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
BATA store manager his name is Rick

309
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,359
He's not happy

310
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,943
He says I don't know if these machines crash on throwing out of my store literally

311
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
I said it will work

312
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
I have no idea why this happened that shouldn't have happened

313
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
Machines are perfect

314
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
Amy

315
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,255
Those two statements it will work and I have no idea where this happened to sort of at odds with

316
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
Howard stays up all night

317
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,071
Sitting on the grocery store

318
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Fixing the code

319
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:57,727
He says he can still remember smelling the cinnamon buns there bacon in the back of the store while he's sitting there trying to figure out

320
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,799
And the next day his machines didn't

321
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,639
But the Shoppers and the machines they still needed a lot of hair

322
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,479
In fact they need so much help that Howard has to invent something

323
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,319
Justin just the person who stands there next to the self-checkout

324
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
Helping the customers in pics

325
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,231
We drill some holes in the cabinet so that if you have to reset the machine because

326
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,863
Just took the long screwdriver in and hit the reset button so we give him a long screwdriver

327
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:31,519
And and and he was very friendly very nice with people and he would like he'd help them through the orders and they made a huge difference

328
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
It's clunky but it's working

329
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
The machines are getting better

330
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,663
And then Howard gets what looks like it's going to be his big

331
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,759
Break Kroger one of the biggest Supermarket chains in the country

332
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
To start buying his machine

333
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,063
Penny stocks

334
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,599
Dreaming of this very big

335
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
Future

336
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,743
We asked him back then when you imagine the grocery store of the future when you imagine the grocery store of Sade

337
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
2016

338
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
What did it look

339
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,143
So in that in that grocery store of of your imagination

340
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
Are there any human being stocking the shelves

341
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,263
No are there any human beings

342
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
I doing check out the cashier snow

343
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
Are there any human beings working there at all

344
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Yeah yeah

345
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,223
Do you have to have so much people taking care of the machines and feeling

346
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
Somebody wants to see humans with a human can

347
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,087
Come see them maybe one maybe one token human

348
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,927
More than that we don't like these word token

349
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
So here we are it's 2016

350
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
And the grocery store of the future looks

351
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
A lot like the grocery store the path

352
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:31,679
It looks basically like grocery stores looked in 1992

353
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
About 90% of

354
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,799
Checkout Lanes in US grocery stores are still managed by Q

355
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
What went wrong

356
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
Yeah we talked to a few people

357
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,991
And a lot of things that Howard was dealing with in the early 90s are still big problems today

358
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
Just last week there was a

359
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
The story about a police Crackdown in Australia

360
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
And Shoppers stealing stuff

361
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
At self-checkout

362
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,231
There is apparently this one store in sweded that's

363
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
Entirely autumn

364
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,095
But like of course yes we know Sweden

365
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
You are perfect

366
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
You've never stolen anything

367
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
Not going to happen to the rest of the

368
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
The rest of the world

369
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,287
There is a place where self checkout

370
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,639
In fact it's so good that we don't even think about it as self check

371
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
I'm on

372
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,479
You know every time you buy something from Amazon

373
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
You go through self

374
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
There is no cashier

375
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Edits

376
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Super

377
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
Easy it's also really hard to steal from him

378
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
True

379
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
I mean you could say sure sure self checkout from Amazon

380
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,047
You know they don't have to deal with the

381
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,375
They're not asking you to look up a bell pepper that

382
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
Doesn't seem to exist in their system

383
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,263
But that is my point it works it doesn't have all of these problems

384
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
You know when you think about grocery stores

385
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,407
I think there's a good chance that it will continue to suck

386
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,503
For as long as it feels like self-checkout for as long as it feels like

387
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,319
You are doing this work this thing that a person

388
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
I mean pretty clearly I think in the long run

389
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,719
The real solution is not a better self checkout machine

390
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,767
It's no checkout at all

391
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
We ran this idea by Dusty Lutz

392
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,631
He runs the self-checkout group at NCR

393
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,471
That's the corporation formerly known as National cash register

394
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,007
Dusty what is

395
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,055
Kind of a big deal in the self check

396
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,615
In fact he was in the room

397
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
When they came up with what is

398
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
Probably the most famous phrase in self-checkout

399
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
As I remember very clearly the day we actually came up with that because we're trying to figure out how

400
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,023
How do we communicate that you might be stealing something

401
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,399
But you might not be stealing something so how do we communicate that and there were many many things like stop thief

402
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Remove this item

403
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,055
Don't steal this from us but but in the end

404
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
You're not fooling anybody

405
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
Where watch

406
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Yes

407
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,759
He said there are already some stores where you can pick up a scanner when you walk in

408
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
And scan your stuff as you walked

409
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
After the store

410
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
But that he said is just a transition

411
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
Here's what the store the few

412
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
Do you walk in the store you pick up your items you walk out

413
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
No cash

414
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
That's right

415
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
You've already registered your phone with

416
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,519
The store so they know who you are and every time you pull something off the shelf there's some tag on the item or some camera that recognizes

417
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,567
Exactly what you're putting in your car

418
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,919
And when you walk out the door the store charges everything that's in your cart to your credit card

419
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,711
And you think that'll actually happen

420
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
That will happen

421
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,087
Yeah the questions will that happen in 2020 or that happen in 2013

422
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,159
So that is the past present and future

423
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
I'm selfish

424
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
There is one less

425
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,023
Why is the guy who invented Aldi

426
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Howard Schneider

427
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,399
Still working in a little office across from a bridge club in a mall in

428
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,471
How old is really good at thinking about the

429
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,519
And he's really good at tinkering with mushy

430
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,847
But he's not really good with thinking about money

431
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
Howard told us back in the mid-90s

432
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,247
Is just as he was getting this big order from Kroger that was going to be his big break

433
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
He had this realization

434
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:04,159
I said well you know if I start buying more parts I'm bankrupt I couldn't afford anything

435
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
You know my wife's name

436
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,023
You spend every sense of these every since I made an emergency room I spent on that

437
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
You don't we had a one-year-old son like she

438
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:17,727
No money for milk this is me know what kind of father are you what's going on and I realize you know what have I done is I solved all these problems but I guess

439
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,543
Guess I didn't really do the financial Cromwell enough

440
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,847
We should say we asked Howard if we

441
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
We could talk with his wife

442
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
She said she didn't want to talk

443
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,735
Justice Howard was about to run out of money

444
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
An old friend of his depth

445
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,319
Basically save the company

446
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
Raise the bunch of money

447
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,391
Howard told us he was embarrassed

448
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
By his financial failure

449
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,487
He told us he felt like it wasn't really his company

450
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
Any left 1995

451
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
He sold his stake in the company

452
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,167
Says he got enough money to buy a nice house in a nice car in Toronto

453
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
And that was it for him in the

454
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
In 2004

455
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
The company that Howard had found

456
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
It sold for 30

457
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
Howard says he regrets leaving when

458
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
And not really because of

459
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
He really doesn't seem to

460
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
Care about the money

461
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
The reason is he thinks if he stayed

462
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,831
He could have built a lot more stuff

463
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,207
You would go to the airport and would they be all my machines you go to restaurant my machines would be everywhere

464
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,511
Lately Howard has been working on a New Prague

465
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
He calls it the dock

466
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
It's a chair

467
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,143
You sit in it and it takes your vital signs

468
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
Shenzhen to compete

469
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,727
He built this prototype in this like

470
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,311
Egg-shaped chairs white plastic on the outside

471
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,151
Red velvet on the inside it looks like a chair from The Jetsons

472
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
While we were visiting our decided
