1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,328
Tony Miranda is the kind of police officer

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,632
Who makes you want to follow the rules

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,704
More because you just don't want to disappoint him

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,240
Not so much because you're

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,008
Scared

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,032
Physically

7
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:16,128
I'm only like 5 6 and 1/2 5 7 out of the academy hours

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,152
Hundred

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
40 lb wet

10
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:25,600
So I was challenged on almost every stop every arrest and they're like okay

11
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,976
Officer take me to jail I like to see you do it to learn how to use

12
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:31,744
His wit

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,048
And he pretty quickly made a name for himself

14
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,352
About 20 years into his career

15
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,400
Tony caught the attention of a nearby

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,704
They wanted him to

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
To be the new police chief

18
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,288
In Irwindale California

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
Just east of LA

20
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,848
It's like a well-kept

21
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,616
Secret

22
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,176
There's only 14 and a residence

23
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,528
And a lot of them are second and third generation ruined aliens

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,576
They've just been there for

25
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Ever

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,672
Apparently people who moved to Irwindale rarely

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,328
It's this town where everyone seems to know each other and it has lots of perks for a town that size

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
A modern Rec Center really nice parks

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Their own little Library

30
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,008
And they are able to provide medical and

31
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
And benefits for the resident

32
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,616
Meaning like if you're a resident of Irwindale

33
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
The city gives you health insurance

34
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
It's not comprehensive but

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,064
It's something that's like a premier little cities are so there's a lot of civic pride in the little community

36
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,904
Lots of Pros to becoming the police chief in Irwindale

37
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
One big caveat

38
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,304
The city was known for the police department because it garnered the most news

39
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608
I'm talking Front Page News

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,424
News at 6 News at 5:11

41
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
And

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
All negative

43
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,776
We're talking about some

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,336
Serious ugly

45
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
Heinous crimes

46
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,992
Like one officer had been accused of sexually assaulting a woman during an early-morning traffic

47
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
Stop another accused of

48
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Embezzlement

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
And now there was a third officer

50
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,416
It was under investigation for having none

51
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Sex with minors

52
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,232
So are you

53
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,536
And I'm not even talking dark cloudy

54
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,352
Cast of black cloud over the whole community

55
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
All of these scandals we're just taking an emoji

56
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:25,408
Emotional toll on this tight-knit little town they were taking a financial told

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,576
These candles cause Irwindale millions of dollars in legal fees

58
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:36,416
And it wasn't just the city footing the bill that

59
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,304
Is what turned this from the police reform story that you usually hear what about protest and activists

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,168
Into an entirely different one a version we had never heard before

61
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,288
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen Duffin and I'm Sarah Gonzales

62

You guys pick the police department

64

And he has a powerful Ally out of

65
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,064
Is back this entire industry that puts a price tag

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
I'm police

67
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:08,416
Behavior a sort of Shadow regulator with the power

68
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
Change police

69
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Insurance

70
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,792
This is the story of what happened

71
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,120
Winnie Police Department can no longer afford it

72
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
Bad behavior

73
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056

00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,880
Is available at aecf. Org

81
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,696
Tony Miranda never thought that it

82
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,256
Easy to clean up the Irwindale police

83
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Department

84
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,352
But as he walks into the building on his first day

85
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,656
He starts to really understand what he's in

86
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
4picture lowlights

87
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,288
A building that was built in about 1985

88
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,128
Bottom of the walls are cinder block they're all dark gray

89
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
And there's no

90
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
Art posters art

91
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
Anything on the walls

92
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,808
Like this is really sad it's depressing in here

93
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,648
There are a lot of basic things that most police departments should have

94
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,976
Like there are these things called mdt's they're these fancy

95
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,583
Computer screen type things that police have in their cars to track 911 calls

96
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Tell them where to go what they respond

97
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,191
Antonis asking his guys

98
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
Why are there only

99
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
A few of these

100
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
And a bunch of them broke

101
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
And I said well if you're not

102
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
Using an NBT how do you get to call

103
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
And one of the patrolman's holds up his palm and he says like this

104
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
I look at his palm I'm going

105
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,783
That's unacceptable

106
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
Until I could see red

107
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,647
Can you call scratch it out Gondola calling scratch it out

108
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,719
He's riding the calls on his palm of his hand with his ink pen

109
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,815
Okay we are really starting from the bottom

110
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,191
And if we have any hope of fixing this this team will have to band together

111
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,775
Those really bad officers the ones wrapped up in the expense

112
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
Glass suits

113
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,871
They had either been fired or we're on leave while they were being invest

114
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
The Gated

115
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,711
But if Tony wants to prevent any new problems

116
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
He needs to fix

117
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
The culture

118
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,855
Administration and the officers just could not get along so

119
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
It was a lot of internal

120
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
Fairs in Ithaca

121
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:22,047
There were 30 employees and 14 Internal Affairs investigation

122
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,399
And these are not just people in the community complaining about bad cops

123
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:31,775
These were cops complaining against other cops and administrators complaining against

124
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,847
Cops it was just unreal never experienced anything like it

125
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,455
Tony quickly realizes that the same thing that makes this small-town great

126
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,527
Is also what has made it such a hard place to chain

127
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
Everyone knows each other

128
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,903
So when there's a fight in the police department the cop might just

129
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
Call is Uncle on the city council

130
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,767
The fights there are entrenched and there

131
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
Personal almost tribal

132
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Saucony things

133
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
We need some new blood

134
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,679
He calls his leadership team together and tells them

135
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
I'm hiring a new number two

136
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
And

137
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
It's not going to be any of you

138
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:11,199
It was really quiet and and one Sergeant stand up and says you know what chief

139
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,015
Police Officers Association not going to stand for that

140
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
They're going to call 4 a.m.

141
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Oh no confidence

142
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
Find me yeah the new guy

143
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,975
Right of the bat basically hey city council fire the

144
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:27,583
This guy so Tony is standing there at home if it's 5 foot 6 l

145
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,631
Looking straight at mu

146
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
And this may have been where the

147
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
The story ends

148
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
But

149
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Tony had more than his width

150
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
Chino's

151
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,103
Change is

152
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
Coming whether they like it or not

153
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
Because of

154
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Their insurance

155
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Authority

156
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,063
In some situations Insurance have a lot of power over Apple

157
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,135
Police Department's most small or mid-sized police

158
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
East Apartments have some kind of insurance

159
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
In part because

160
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,023
Police Department's get sued all the time for all kinds of things

161
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Justified or not

162
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
And insurance help

163
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Cover the rest

164
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
Big cities like Los Angeles they get enough taxpayer money that they can

165
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
Basically self-insure like

166
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,567
Set aside some money for a rainy day or a lawsuit

167
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,407
But smaller cities like Irwindale they actually buy insurance

168
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
Through either a private insurer or something called a municipal risk pool a municipal risk pool is kind of like

169
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
Like a family car insurance

170
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,207
Irwindale is on the same insurance plan as a bunch of other please

171
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
Nice apartments in Calif

172
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,815
And if one of those Police Department's gets in a wreck

173
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,119
Everyone's premium can go up

174
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
They call them

175
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:39,263
And the worst part about this plan is that everyone knows it's your fault

176
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
Irwindale

177
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
You're the bad teenage driver in this family

178
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
So they needed to either

179
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
Get a handle on things or

180
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
Cancel their policy is that was that was it

181
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
What are the two options

182
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,367
Yes or you can you need to shop for another one

183
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
And you'll be paying some premium

184
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,767
That's if you can even find another insurer willing to take you on

185
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
If you can't

186
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,119
You might lose your Police Department altogether

187
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
Because one incident could race

188
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,959
Taxes are even bankrupt

189
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
Small town one run

190
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,287
Conviction one use of excess Force

191
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,919
And Tony wanted to make sure his rank-and-file understood the stakes were that high

192
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
So he brings them all together and says

193
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,087
Let me tell you guys a little story about Maywood California you know me what about

194
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,367
20 miles west of us

195
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,695
Their Police Department also had a lot of problems

196
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,279
And our risk for our family insurance plan

197
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
Got tired of footing the bill

198
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
First

199
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
Maywood God of War

200
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,191
They were told they needed to fix it

201
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
They didn't

202
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
And they lost

203
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,287
Insurance

204
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,895
They can no longer be police officer because of the motto of exposure they have

205
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
The whole Police Department

206
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Shut down

207
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,759
The city of Maywood couldn't bear the risk

208
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Of having police

209
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
Without the insurance Authority

210
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,623
Antoni tells his officers

211
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
I was there at the end

212
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,487
The day they shut down I remember it

213
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Just before midnight

214
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
All of the Maywood Police Officers

215
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
Lineup in the parking lot

216
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
Dressed in their finest

217
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
Tell their standard

218
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
San Marino

219
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
Already 2825 years on

220
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,895
And they're about to lose their career in their jobs and I know this

221
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
And

222
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,759
It's like being at a funeral everybody's crying in the audience

223
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
And these

224
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
Grown men are standing here weeping

225
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
One by one

226
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
Each officer steps forward

227
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
Picks up the police radio

228
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
And what does

229
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,511
Chief does have them

230
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,863
Do one last radio transmission saying that they're going out of service

231
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Charlie glass

232
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,775
These are recordings of those final Transmissions

233
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
When Charlene

234
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
And they had to do a final salute and then he takes their badge

235
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
And take their

236
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,183
They put their portable radio in a box

237
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
The last one to go is

238
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
The police chief

239
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
He salutes

240
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
And then he signs off for the last time

241
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,959
Cudahy Police Department

242
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
This will be our last

243
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Transmission

244
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
David Feliz

245
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
Call Darrell b1070

246
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
End of Watch

247
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
God bless all of you

248
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,879
So I shared that story with them and I said

249
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
I've seen bigger stronger

250
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
Mendon yuan in this room

251
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
Broken down in tears

252
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,303
Don't think for a minute

253
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
Did it will not happen

254
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
I've seen it happen

255
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,447
Tony says this is the moment

256
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
After he told that story

257
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,775
Did he started to notice a ship

258
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
At the Irwindale police

259
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
Police Department

260
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
This is real this is

261
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,151
An exterior threat that could

262
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
Close Irwindale police department down

263
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
This was

264
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
Real

265
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,319
Irwindale censure had made it

266
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
Very

267
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,903
Clear Irwindale PD had to follow a

268
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,695
Performance Improvement plan

269
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
We had eight things to fix

270
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
And 18 months to fix them

271
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
The clock

272
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095

. org

281
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:51,167
Quick note I did reach out to Irwindale ensure and other people in town and many of them were willing to talk

282
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
But said that

283
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,727
City official had told them not to speak

284
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,567
However we verified the story with some folks who just

285
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Didn't want to be recorded

286
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
And with public

287
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Okay back to the story

288
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,783
For a long time a lot of police departments weren't allowed to buy insurance

289
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,367
People that it would create moral hazard basically

290
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,439
If your risky behavior is covered by someone else

291
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
You might do more of it

292
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:20,607
But then in the 1960s there were a few Supreme Court rulings that gave police more rules

293
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:26,495
The right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law

294
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,287
That's right

295
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
Shoutout Law & Order there

296
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
And all of this

297
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,687
Made it much easier to sue the police so

298
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,479
Moral hazard be damned

299
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,039
Smaller police departments felt like they had to get in

300
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
There's a hole

301
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,903
Big powerful well-financed industry

302
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,231
Daddy's trying to influence police

303
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:53,631
Behavior this is John Rappaport he's a law professor at the University of Chicago and he wrote one of the first paper

304
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,703
Looking at the influence of insurance on police

305
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,335
In the mix of a discussion that is often understandably heated and emotional

306
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,431
Insurers Look at police departments through the cold hard lens

307
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Of an actuary

308
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,271
Does this police Behavior create risk

309
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
If yes

310
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
Let's reduce it

311
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
It's a business relationship

312
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,927
To say we're actually not

313
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,279
Protesters are activists we're not telling you you're bad

314
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
We're just telling you

315
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,375
That your numbers are worse than they were last

316
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,935
And we want to bring them back down to where they were

317
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,007
The goal of these insurers is not just to win lawsuit

318
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,359
It's to be so above board that nobody even brings a lawsuit

319
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,223
So often insurance issue guidelines that are more strict than the law

320
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
Chicks strip search

321
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,367
After the Supreme Court said police can strip search pretty much anyone for any arrest

322
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
This one insurance was like

323
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,743
Yeah we're going to give our police some restriction

324
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
And they added things like

325
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
You should have someone of the same gender

326
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
Conduct a strip search

327
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
And you should do it

328
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
In a sanitary setting

329
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
And those are things that

330
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Actually aren't in

331
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
The Supreme Court's opinion

332
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
But it seemed time I think the

333
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
The insurer was you know

334
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,967
Using common sense

335
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
How would this look to a jury

336
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,111
And if you really want to make sure people are behaving the way they should

337
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
Sometimes

338
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
You got to be proactive

339
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
One insure

340
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
Said that they send

341
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,071
An insurance representative to hang out at cop bars

342
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
And listen to gossip

343
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
I mean if you do hear anything alarming they reported back to the

344
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
Vying for that job I'll go you know if you really need me to go drink in whatever.

345
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,687
And John says look they don't just leave cops out there hoping they don't match

346
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
They also try to help them out

347
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
In the most insurance way possible

348
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,879
Doing things like updating police manuals or giving them training

349
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,231
And if the department does get better there are rewards like lower premium

350
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,815
So back in Irwindale Tony has his to-do list

351
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,935
Ba things that his family insurance plan has said he has to change in 18 months

352
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,263
Antonio added a few things himself to help fix the culture

353
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
Calls all his people together

354
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,615
And he stepped up to the Whiteboard

355
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
And says alright

356
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,919
This is how we're going to

357
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Why do we are going to treat this like a plane crash

358
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
A plane just crash in Irwindale

359
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
You're all paramedics

360
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Let's

361
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,439
Triage this that start with the most essential

362
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
Equipment

363
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:31,583
Remember those monitors the ones that tell cops where to go when they're responding to a 911 call

364
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,655
Irwindale fix them up and bought some more

365
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
The stuff that would help reduce risk

366
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
You know

367
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
Going on a 911 call is pretty important that

368
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
You're sweaty Palm Desert

369
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
Turn the 9 into a

370
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
3 or 6

371
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,175
They fixed up their patrol car is fixed

372
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,759
The cameras in their cars got workplace harassment training and

373
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:53,343
More training community-based policing

374
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
Courses

375
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:01,279
Officer safety change was that Tony had to run almost everything he did buy the insurance Authority

376
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,351
Like if you wanted to discipline someone or fire someone

377
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
He needed their permission

378
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,239
We met every I think it was every Wednesday at 10 a.m.

379
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,079
Without I mean you cleared your calendar you're going to be there

380
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
Field have to run your

381
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
Things by Insurance Company

382
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Well

383
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
It was not common practice ask

384
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
And

385
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,183
To a certain degree act out second-guess but at the end of the day

386
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
It just adds

387
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
More credibility

388
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Because

389
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,071
It wasn't Justice outside Chief saying

390
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,863
This is what we're going to do

391
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
It's also our insurance company

392
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
Who can make us or break us

393
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:46,847
Tony says they didn't really overrule his decisions they just made him explain why he wanted some

394
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,943
Something and as long as it made sense they were cool with it was her appointment with you thought

395
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
This might

396
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
Work

397
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
I think it was in year two axle

398
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
In my second year on the 4th of July

399
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,671
It was Urban deals Independence Day party in all the cops

400
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Time to work

401
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,255
So Tony brought a grill made everyone

402
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
Tacos

403
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,327
Somewhere in the middle of it Tony took

404
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Picture

405
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
And

406
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,447
The day was over and I went home and I looked at that picture on my cell phone

407
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,287
And I looked at their faces and they were all smiling

408
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,103
And I hadn't seen that anywhere

409
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
No Irwindale is just one police department in one small town with a specific set of issues

410
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
If you step back though

411
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:32,159
And ask whether insurance is an effective way to improve Police Department

412
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Overall

413
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
John Rappaport

414
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
That law professor says

415
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Sometimes

416
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,607
The issues they care about most are the expensive

417
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
Things that might generate

418
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Large payouts like

419
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Excessive force

420
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:48,031
But the less legally expensive the issue

421
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,823
The less likely insurance is

422
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
Two addresses

423
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:56,735
Because insurers aren't making moral judgments for them police reform is a business

424
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,343
For Irwindale pressure from an insurance Authority seems to have helped

425
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,415
18 months after Tony showed up under that

426
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,535
Cloud the insurance authority to Clare. Irwindale new and improved

427
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
They could keep their coverage

428
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
They could stay a police depart

429
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,471
Antoni says he doesn't think they could have done it without that performance improved

430
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
Open plan that pet

431
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
I have to say

432
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
Without that pimp

433
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:26,175
The officers will continue to be aggressive than continue to fight absent of the pimp

434
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,991
I'm not sure if Irwindale would be here today

435
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
I'm really not sure

436
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
I'm I'm not sure

437
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
Tony decided

438
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,159
His work was done and he handed off the department

439
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
To a new job

440
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,511
I'm handing you the keys to a Cadillac

441
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
Please take care

442
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
These guys are good guys

443
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,119
And you're very lucky

444
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
You're lucky

445
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,447
Were you driving when you got there late

446
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,847
