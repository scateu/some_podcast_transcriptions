10
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,392
Nick Snyder is devoting his life

11
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
To this

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
1 elements

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
On the periodic table

14
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:32,768
Cute

15
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,304
And it's

16
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,864
Kind of like a tribute to his great-uncle

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,192
His name was Charles Conrad. I won't call him Pete

18
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,752
Charles Conrad and everyone called him Pete

19
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
Uncle P

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,080
Was an astronaut

21
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
Keep

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,176
Walked on the moon was the third person to walk on the

23
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,712
But he wasn't like

24
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,016
Serious nerdy astronaut think

25
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,552
Daredevil

26
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
Prankster asked

27
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,368
Yeah it is

28
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,720
Personal motto I think a bit tongue-in-cheek was if you can't be good be colorful

29
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
Like as Uncle Pete walk down the ladder

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
Toward the Moon

31
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
Key made

32
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
Another dramatic pronouncement

33
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,448
But a joke about being shorter than the other ask

34
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,360
Small step for Neil Armstrong

35
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
But a long one for me

36
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Uncle Pete is walking on the moon just like Dum Dee Dum Dum Dum

37
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
This is

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Actual audio

39
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
From the Moon

40
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
You did a lot of colorful things in his

41
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
NASA career

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
Quite a memorable character

43
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,568
Because of his Uncle Pete Nick grew up obsessed

44
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
With everything about outer space

45
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
And this is what brings us to Nick

46
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
Obsession with

47
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Helium

48
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,760
You cannot send a rocket to space

49
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
Without

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Helium

51
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,856
And a few years ago Nick heard

52
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
But the world

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Is running short

54
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
On helium

55
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
And that is going to

56
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
Put at risk

57
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
Space exploration and access to space which

58
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,472
Certainly was something near and dear to my great uncle in my whole family

59
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
Helium is

60
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
Crucial for way more than space

61
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
If you need helium to run

62
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
MRI machine

63
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
Look for doctors to detect

64
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,944
Cancer and tumors

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,224
Unique helium to keep

66
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
Deep sea divers den

67
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,576
Electronic chips for our cell phones and computers

68
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,624
Made using helium

69
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
Soak the helium shortage threatens

70
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
All of that

71
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:42,048
Also birthday parties their entire birthday parties and proms

72
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,328
With droopy

73
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,376
Helium love balloons because

74
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,424
Some party stores are out

75
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
Epithelium

76
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:54,848
So when Nick hears about the helium shortage he thinks of his great-uncle.

77
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896
And all this other important

78
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Helium stuff

79
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,200
And he decides

80
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,248
He's going to go looking

81
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,272
4 more

82
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,040

00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:10,208
Hello and welcome to Planet money from NPR I'm Sarah

84
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
Today on the show

85
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
The helium shortage

86
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,072
And how we got here

87
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
Helium is

88
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
So special and so rare

89
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,264
Does the US government once tried to buy a

90
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
All

91
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
The helium

92
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Entitle

93
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
Before anyone else in the world new

94
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
Where human was or what it could

95
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
Also we go exploring

96
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,552
For new sources of helium with Nick

97
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
We've got our

Any drill

100

Made of diamond

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952

DJ's Senator Elizabeth Warren is riding around Iowa in NRV campaigning

115
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,983
And I'm back we have a huge sign that says

116
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,823
Honk if you want big structural change

117
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
And according to Warren it is getting attention

118
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:37,247
We had Truckers coming by and they were they were really on the big air for

119
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:42,367
Play NPR politics podcast hit the road to ask Lauren about all that structural changes

120
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135

00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
The story of helium is

123
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
Largely a story of the US government

124
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,303
It has

125
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
A massive stockpile

126
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Aquila

127
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,447
And one of the people in charge of that stuff pile

Stamford

129
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
What are your thoughts on balloons

130
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
Party balloons

131
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
Yeah like helium used for

132
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,919
Graduations in party personally love

133
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,943
Party balloons

134
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,527
I think it's not a party without balloons right so

135
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,831
I'm a big fan of party balloon

136
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
And Sam

137
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Love's

138
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Helium

139
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
I like helium

140
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,743
If it's my element

141
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
It's an amazing material

142
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
I've spent my whole life working with it

143
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
I'm quite the helium geek

144
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Sam says

145
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,775
Astronomers first identified helium in the Sun

146
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
In 1868

147
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,383
And as far as anybody knew there was almost none of it on Earth

148
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
Just design

149
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
But then in 1905

150
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
It was found

151
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
On accident

152
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,063
In Dexter Kansas

153
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
Mixed up in the natural gas bear

154
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
A couple of scientist discovered

155
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,487
Oh my gosh this is helium this is the same stuff that's on the Sun

156
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:56,351
This is the first time that anyone has found helium in any significant amount

157
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,191
Anywhere on Earth so scientist bottle it up to start test

158
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
And they learned that

159
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Helium is

160
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Really

161
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
Light

162
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Like

163
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,591
So late

164
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
It can lift

165
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Things

166
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,711
Like if you fill a balloon with helium it will

167
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
Lift and Float off

168
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,623
But at that point people already knew that hydrogen this other gas could

169
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
Lift things

170
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:26,047
These people were using hydrogen to lift blimps this was before airplanes are really a thing so blimps are real

171
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Really big deal

172
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,887
People are flying around in giant blend

173
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
But hydrogen blimp

174
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,287
We're dangerous they were catching on fire because hydrogen is very

175
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Very

176
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Flammable

177
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
Helium

178
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
It's not

179
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Helium will not catch on fire

180
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,247
The military found that application very very interesting

181
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,111
The US military thinks a lifting gas that doesn't burn

182
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Wood

183
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,439
Transform Warfare in the air

184
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
Answer the government was like

185
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
Hey Dexter Kansas

186
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,327
We'd like to have him by your helium

187
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Yeah

188
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,983
And it was actually top-secret work it was considered highly top-secret how we getting that that helium gas

189
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
The military saw so much potential in this helium

190
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
That they decide to

191
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
To keep it to themselves

192
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,783
And in fact of the German government approached the United States and requesting helium and because it was a

193
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,831
The defense minerals a strategic mineral

194
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:25,695
I said no we wouldn't give them our helium we would not give them our helium

195
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,791
And how we got it was considered very very very hush-hush Tussaud

196
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
How did Germany know that we had killed

197
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
Apparently somebody

198
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
That's where you getting it from well. He's got it

199
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,799
Government researchers are using all these

200
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
Code words for helium like

201
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
He is lost

202
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,711
Send more pups from the same litter

203
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Batman

204
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
By the 1920s the government is sending helium to the Army and the Navy indeed

205
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
Big metal cylinders to

206
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
Fill up

207
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
The first ever

208
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
Super Save

209
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
Helium blimp

210
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,327
They could attach bombs to these blimps

211
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Spy on enemies

212
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
From the air

213
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,935
But there's a problem

214
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,263
The helium kept leaking out of the cylinders

215
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Lake

216
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
Slowly over time

217
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
Helium is an escape artists

218
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
If there's a whole helium will find it

219
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
Sneaky little element

220
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,039
It absolutely if there's a leak it'll it'll get out

221
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,855
Helium is one of the smallest

222
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
Lightest things

223
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
In the universe

224
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
It's so light

225
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
And floaties

226
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,559
That it's one of the only things that can

227
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Escape Earth

228
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,375
Gravitational pull

229
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
It will just

230
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Float

231
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
And out

232
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
Into the universe

233
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Where helium

234
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Is a bunting

235
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,871
So if you try to trap

236
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
Helium in a cylinder

237
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
It will find a way out

238
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
So you're just like use it real quick

239
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,831
Because if it disappears are closed off it to outer space

240
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Yeah

241
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
But eventually

242
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
This problem

243
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,463
Helium leaks out of everything

244
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,303
Turned out to be really useful for the space program

245
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
It's the height of the Space Race and

246
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,911
We want to make sure that Uncle Pete's

247
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,727
Space suit and his Rockets don't have any leaks

248
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
Any leak in a rocket engine

249
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
And it could have

250
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
Explode

251
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
Dissolution

252
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
Cast of suits

253
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
Wiki Liam

254
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
If helium doesn't leak out

255
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
They're super sealed

256
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
And it's not just

257
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Testing for leak

258
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:32,671
You need helium to launch a rocket like to push an astronaut

259
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,695
Into space

260
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,511
So the US starts to realize

261
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
We need helium

262
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
More than ever

263
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
It's a matter of National Security

264
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
And this

265
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Kicked off

266
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,007
A series of government decisions and counter decisions and

267
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
Counter counter decision

268
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
That lead

269
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
To today's helium shortage

270
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,943
Okay we know helium is in natural gas

271
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
But a lot of it was just

272
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
Floating away

273
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,343
So in 1960 Congress passes a law

274
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,647
The set up a national helium

275
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,463
Stop by all the South pile where Sam works today

276
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,511
At the Bureau of Land

277
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
Congress says to the

278
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
Sam of 1960

279
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,703
Go to the US Treasury and borrow the money you need

280
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
To buy a

281
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
Hun

282
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Of helium

283
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
Pay whatever you have to

284
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:26,431
So it's really a win-win it's it's to the to the Natural Gas producers helium is kind of a waste product

285
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
So of course natural gas company start

286
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
Capturing their helium and

287
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
Selling tons of it to the government

288
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
And now

289
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
America has to figure out

290
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,439
How to

291
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Dora the

292
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,279
Sneaky gas that escapes from any container you put it in

293
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
And then

294
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Someone goes

295
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
Okay hear me out

296
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
What if

297
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,775
We put the helium back in the container

298
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
It came from

299
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Like

300
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
Underground

301
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,967
They find a huge chunk of underground rock near Amarillo

302
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Texas it has

303
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
These holes in it that helium likes to

304
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,319
Float into

305
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
If used to have a bunch of helium

306
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:12,255
And in 1960 the US government starts injecting helium

307
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
Back into that rock

308
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
And they injected 32 billion cubic feet of helium that's an awful lot of helium that they put into the ground for future

309
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,263
Your use like how far down into the Earth are we talk

310
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Skincare

311
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,591
It's 3000 3250

312
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
Down in the ground

313
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
Where did where the dinosaur bones

314
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
There's somewhere in there right

315
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Yep

316
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,807
This is the only stockpile of helium

317
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,831
Anywhere in the world

318
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,647
Other countries have tried to trap helium

319
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
And failed

320
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,719
So this stockpile

321
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Totally topsy

322
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,071
It was like cold war Cold War stuff

323
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
To protect

324
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
The field from

325
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Prying eyes

326
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,423
The government was

327
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
Hiding the helium

328
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
In a field

329
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
Near Amarillo Texas

330
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,335
Imagine of a wide-open Texas Prairie

331
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
There is slightly Rolling Hills

332
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
Predominantly flat

333
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:08,319
Hershey to see a big open plain you slide back this metal cover and look down and there's a ladder that takes you down

334
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,719
Walking around the field like I was just a field just an empty field and then there's like a little door and you open it

335
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,023
There's a well solar there so

336
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
It really is

337
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Important

338
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
Elements in the entire universe

339
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
Down here

340
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
There you go

341
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,495
By 1973 there was

342
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,543
So much helium under that rock

343
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,847
But the government stop injecting more

344
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
They thought they had enough

345
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
For like a hundred years

346
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
Bay

347
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
We're wrong

348
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:42,367
Buy 1996 two decades later if the helium world had totally changed

349
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:47,743
Yes Sam was still selling government helium to the military and NASA and

350
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,303
The weather people and science researchers

351
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
But now

352
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
There's this whole big

353
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
Private helium industry to like

354
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Private companies

355
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
Selling helium to private company

356
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,567
Run MRI machines blow up party balloons whatever

357
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
So Congress is like

358
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:08,223
Why the hell is the US government in the helium business why are we maintaining this

359
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Stop

360
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,039
This was a national security issue

361
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
It is no longer

362
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
And it cannot be justified as a jobs program either

363
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
It needs to be put to rest

364
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
Spire

365
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
They introduced a bill to

366
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Casella

367
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
All the government here

368
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,375
Shutting down in any fishing facility

369
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,447
Which has outlived its need and can't compete

370
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
With a private sector

371
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
Congress votes to get out of the helium is

372
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,335
They tell Sam

373
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Sell off

374
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,895
All the helium you've got

375
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Not just to the government

376
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,503
To anyone who wants it sell it as fast as you can

377
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,343
It has nothing to do with the market nothing to do with how much

378
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
People are willing

379
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
To pay for it

380
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
What could go wrong

381
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
I would say that

382
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
We were doing it just for our own expenses

383
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
And with Sam and his colleagues

384
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
Didn't realize

385
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
Was that they were flooding the market with

386
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Cheap

387
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Helium

388
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,287
So cheap that it wasn't worth it for private companies

389
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
To try and find

390
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
New helium anymore

391
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
Their low prices

392
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,943
We're killing the private helium industry

393
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,271
And by 2013 Congress was like

394
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:18,111
Wait our plant turns ubm over to Private Industry

395
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Didn't work

396
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,207
There is no real Private Industry

397
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
We messed it up

398
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
So they gave them New Order

399
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
Congress

400
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Said

401
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
You need to raise those prices

402
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,959
Congress told team Sam at the helium stockpile

403
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Increase

404
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
The price of helium

405
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
To encourage

406
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,127
Private Industry to go looking for new sources

407
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
So now

408
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
If people wanted to buy this

409
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,991
Rare precious gas

410
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
They were going to have to

411
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
The fight for it

412
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,087
Sam and his colleagues.

413
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
Auctioning

414
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
Helium off

415
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
To the highest bidder

416
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
The price of helium

417
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Went up

418
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
It raised up fairly quickly

419
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:02,911
It raised up to in the in the 60 to $70 range during this time. I think we're in the air

420
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:09,311
80 $80 range the auctions it's it's up at the 219

421
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
Send Congress told teamsam

422
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,151
Start auctioning off of helium

423
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
The price has gone up from around

424
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
$55

425
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Per thousand cubic feet

426
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,807
2 $119

427
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,135
Helium is more expensive than ever and

428
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,695
People are paying to get it

429
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:31,839
But the demand for helium is so high right now that Sam and the people at the helium stockpile

430
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,655
Literally cannot pull it out of the ground

431
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Fast enough

432
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,495
We are delivering what we can as fast as we can

433
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,055
And sometimes it's not as much as they actually need

434
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,639
Well there's more in the ground but we can't give it more than what we can deliver it

435
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,479
So they're rationing helium everyone gets just

436
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
Some of what they actually mean

437
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,111
Which is why some birthday parties have droopy balloons

438
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,231
And why helium has become too expensive for some scientist to do their research

439
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,327
It's becoming scarce enough that some in the science Community say

440
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,887
The government should ban helium balloons

441
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,423
Save it for more important

442
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Hatsune

443
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
It won't be up to the government at all anymore

444
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
The government has

445
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,615
To get out of the helium business

446
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Entirely

447
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,943
By 2021 once and for all

448
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
That's what the last

449
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
Gilliam Law requires

450
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,111
And they're not just selling off the last of the helium trapped in the rock

451
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
At the highest price

452
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
They are like

453
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,999
Selling the field with the hidden door selling the building

454
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
To all the nuts and bolts in

455
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Pipes

456
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,607
Yep Roc

457
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
Computers desk

458
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
It's all that stuff

459
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,471
September 30th of 2021

460
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
I going to take like a little bit of

461
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
Helium with you

462
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,127
We better not do that just a little bit

463
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
No

464
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
I better not do that

465
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,271
Now that Sam and the government are getting out

466
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,319
People like Nick Snyder

467
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,135
The guy who's great Uncle Pete walked on the moon

468
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,159
Are getting in

469
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,743
In 2013 the year Congress Ed helium

470
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Has to get

471
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
More expensive

472
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
Nick started a company that year

473
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
He called it North American kill you

474
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:14,751
Means we drill holes in the ground looking for new sources of helium in North America

475
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
End

476
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
I invited myself along to Saskatchewan Canada this is what they call the Prairies right

477
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:28,575
Canada very much for a long time in both directions they find a lot of

478
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,975
Dinosaur fossils found here, Indiana Jones guys

479
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
Here's what you do step one

480
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,863
Find a place where there once was helium

481
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,655
And go back and see if there's more

482
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
Images going to drill holes

483
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,751
A mile and a half into the Earth

484
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:50,335
If you don't at least have some suspicions that there might be helium there

485
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
We have Bob

486
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,271
Specifically promised or investors that we are not going to do that

487
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,831
These people drilling for oil

488
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
Stumbled onto helium

489
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,463
And it's going to see if there's maybe any more left down there

490
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Step 2

491
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
Get the rights to

492
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,839
Suck the helium out of the ground

493
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:17,215
Nick doesn't just get your own whatever you then he finds he has to go through the Canadian government

494
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
And his deal with them

495
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Invest

496
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,823
Tens of millions of dollars

497
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Cheap

498
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,967
All the helium you can find on 1.8 million Acres of Canadian Prairie

499
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
- release

500
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,831
Step 3

501
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
Rent-A-Wreck

502
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Higher crew

503
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
Click the short

504
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,719
14 hours later

505
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
Yeah

506
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:47,167
When we get to this rig they give me some coveralls

507
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:53,567
Toggle tighten up my hard hat I've got my steel toe boots on feeling

508
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:59,967
Particularly powerful let's go punch some holes in the ground and look for the union and entire

509
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
Aircrew comes with me up on the rig we walk up some stairs to this metal platform

510
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:12,767
Dog House everybody hangs out in the doghouse basically a trailer up on the rig

511
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:19,167
Apparently that's where you want to be on a rig and the two guys on the floor running the wrenches to call

512
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:25,567
Who are the Roughnecks the Roughnecks

513
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
There's lots of cool names that's for sure

514
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
And this guy

515
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
He has the coolest name he is

516
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,039
The mud man official title it's honest trailer

517
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
Bruce schievelbein

518
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Mudman

519
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:43,231
What mom told me years ago to stay quit playing in the mud and I never listen to her and still doing it

520
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
The Mudman is essential

521
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,327
First step

522
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
4

523
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,119
Drill a hole

524
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:54,239
There is a drill that slowly breaks into the Earth over several days

525
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,799
Through millions of years of rock it's like

526
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
A metal ball

527
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
Smaller than a volleyball

528
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
Drill holes into the Rock

529
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,063
How do you insure a mile this drill has these little knobs

530
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,599
Diamond

531
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
All over it

532
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
For strength

533
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,951
It wouldn't look good on your finger but

534
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
Oh my God I can't miss this

535
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
If you turn this

536
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:25,983
Small heavy Diamond Drill over there are these little Jets on the bottom that shootout

537
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,799
A special kind of mud that the mud man make

538
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,431
It's it looks like smooth and silky like it looks good

539
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Very slippery

540
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
Probably good for your skin

541
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
The best cold

542
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
Slippery mud that shoots out of the

543
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,391
The drill as it smashing Through The Rock

544
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927
It's like a pressure washer

545
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,975
And the mud send

546
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
Rock shavings

547
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
Shooting up to the surface

548
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,119
Every 15 minutes a geologist

549
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
Looks at those rocks

550
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,447
Those Rock

551
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:58,495
Crumbs will tell them

552
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,287
When they've hit the rock they're looking

553
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,383
For the rock with all the holes in it where helium likes to live

554
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,967
You do not want to drill past the rock you want because

555
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:12,063
Reeling is expensive Nikki spending $50,000 a day

556
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Andre Lee

557
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:19,232
That's the cutting sample that you're very very old rock

558
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
I think there's like dinosaur fossils mixed into this

559
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,680
The farther back in time you go

560
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
They have drilled

561
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,984
We pass

562
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Food recipe

563
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Like

564
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,848
855 million years

565
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
Cast where the dinosaur fossils are

566
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,248
And after 11 days of drilling here

567
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,904
They hit what they were looking for saw the the zone of Interest we saw the rock properties that we were looking for

568
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,304
So you just saw like oh this this is the kind of rock Wii U like this this means there could be healed

569
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,448
That's correct that is Marlon McDougall he works with Nick

570
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
And the final step

571
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
It's a build a plant

572
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,336
To separate the helium from all the other things except

573
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,104
6th and West

574
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,224
They're doing that 2 hours away from here and they can Marlin take me to see it

575
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,440
Welcome to Battle Creek this will be the next producing helium plant in Saskatchewan

576
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,232
You're looking at it right there

577
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,024
What am I looking at

578
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
You're looking at a farmer's field right now but

579
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,632
That's for the plants going to start being built within a year

580
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
It's one man with a giant balloon

581
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,544
Don't forget you need a ride back

582
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
Yeah exactly

583
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,640
The only thing we can see is grass

584
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
But off in the distance

585
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,456
There's this

586
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Little.

587
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
That's the thing

588
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,320
Helium will flow out of

589
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,600
You can see a little red

590
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,648
Yeah, Cabrera

591
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,184
Fiery red color

592
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
That's called the well

593
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,744
Faucet it looks like a faucet

594
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,536
Sure that works faucet

595
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,936
And so you turn on turn it on and it would flow helium right now

596
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Likes

597
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:10,336
Much louder and much more much more Force like a jet engine

598
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:16,224
What it like shoot me out it would kill you

599
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
Good good to know

600
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:24,928

601
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
