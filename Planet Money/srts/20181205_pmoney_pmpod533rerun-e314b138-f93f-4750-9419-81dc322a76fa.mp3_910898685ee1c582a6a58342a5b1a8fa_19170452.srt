All together

14
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Opening

15
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
The UPS Store

16
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,920
Everything for small business

17
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,712
And of course shipping

18
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,064
What's your name

19
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
Emily

20
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:29,696
Emily and you're out here raising money for charity on the street in Midtown Manhattan

21
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,464
Yes

22
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,536
I'm trying to get people to give the public radio right now

23
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,864
By getting them to go to donate that npr.org Planet Money

24
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
Can you give me your top tips

25
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
You do the trick dislike

26
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,496
You got a hook them at the beginning and you're like

27
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,592
Do you have a minute for dying seal to do that one

28
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,384
I don't do that one

29
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,736
Will usually do something funny like are you as friendly as you are fashionable

30
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,760
Stuff like that

31
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,064
Oh so you are you put on the charm event

32
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Yeah

33
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,368
Ilima smile

34
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,744
Cool so I'm if I'm trying to get people to go to donate that npr.org Planet Money

35
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
How should I do that

36
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,608
You should definitely get them the last first and then

37
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,912
I would say

38
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,192
You got to be confident

39
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,264
I don't know tell him to go right on over there go check it out

40
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,968
Hey today's episode originally ran in 2014 and we've got a small update for you at the end

41
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
This week Zoe and I went

42
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,040
The New York

43
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,624
Would you like to ride in the Cherokee the Wrangler or the grand cherry

44
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
Will get it to anyone

45
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,744
We're getting a test drive since this is Manhattan

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
Can't really take it off

47
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,096
Road bike jeep has built a driving track

48
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,680
A bunch of fake Hills and bumps all set up right in the middle of the city

49
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,264
Welcome to Camp cheap because my name is Steven I'll be your operator

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,360
And we are going to slide around the track here in our 2014

51
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
Jeep Wrangler

52
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
This is the unlimited so it has the four-door and all this type of the Jeep takes off and we are going up this incline and

53
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
I swear

54
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
That's where the car is about to tip over

55
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
And then we whip around the corner we start bouncing up and down over bunch of stumps in the road

56
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
All right

57
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
Made it

58
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Could you drive this Jeep off-road

59
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Driving on dirt roads

60
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
Yeah absolutely that's what this

61
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,248
This particular kind of Jeep Grand Wrangler

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Could you drive through a river

63
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,624
You can water poured with it that's one of the things that makes Jeep

64
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
A trail rig vehicle is waterboarding

65
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
So can you drive this thing anywhere

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
Babylon places you can't drive a Cadillac

67
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,120
But you cannot drive this car

68
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Anywhere

69
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
Because he doesn't mention one

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
Very large place

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
It will not allow this car in their roads

72
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Europe

73
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
This particular Jeep

74
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Would be illegal in Paris

75
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,432
It would be illegal in Milan would be breaking the law in Berlin

76
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
Because of a technical

77
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,040
All the safety features on this Jeep

78
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
The airbag the bumper

79
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
They're built to us safety

80
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,208
And there is an entirely different set of standards in Europe

81
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,024
And so in order to sell this particular Jeep in Europe

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,888
Jeep will have to replace a bunch of parts redesign other parts in the Europeans have the same issue

83
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
Volkswagen Golf

84
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,336
You can see it driving the Autobahn in Berlin but it is not yet arrived in the United States

85
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,736
The German company has to sort of remanufactured the car for a completely different set of CC Radio

86
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,600
Right now it's actually the case that you developed a vehicle twice

87
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,440
Once for North America and once for Euro

88
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,768
Hello and welcome to Planet Money Zoe Chace

89
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,376
Today why can't you build a car that can be driven anywhere in the world

90
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,472
We go to the car show and we talked to designers and car company executive

91
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
But one of the biggest

92
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,544
Technical challenges that they face

93
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
Making all these different governments happy

94
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:05,248
In these subtle differences in safety regulations they end up making our cars cost more

95

103
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,151
You walk into a car show and it is like a brand explosion boom

104
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Honda

105
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Toyota

00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
Acura BMW

Maserati

108
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
Porsche.

109
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,927
Jaguar XE Mercedes in Alfa Romeo and big vw's back there I can barely see

110
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,071
It's like being inside a glossy magazine all the cars are sparkly and new with

111
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:57,471
A special lights on them exactly how you sort of picture a car showed actually big raised up stages like lazy

112
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,079
Susan's rotating around and yes completely dressed women in high heels standing

113
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
And the police is

114
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Filled with

115
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
He sort of Mad Men type

116
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
Just guys

117
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
In suits

118
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,551
Everywhere that look like Don Draper and Roger Sterling walking around

119
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
Winning at the cars Consulting with the

120
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Each other

121
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
And chatting up the women I talked about in the high heel

122
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Be jealous

123
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,839
Here it is

124
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
MX-5 Miata

125
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
25th Anniversary Edition

126
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:32,031
This whole show is a lot of

127
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Fox

128
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
For something that is

129
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
But a car is a special kind of Pop

130
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,503
It is super complicated is a highly technical product

131
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
It's often the most

132
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Expensive thing we own

133
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
And

134
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
It is one of those highly regulated products in the world

135
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
Which country developed

136
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
Their own regulator

137
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,535
They have their own laws their own testing standards and

138
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
Friends even the Expert Car Guys

139
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,959
Admittedly is not us even they cannot figure out some rationale for the

140
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,983
Standards being different

141
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
That's why we met up with Dave shepardson

142
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
He covers cars

143
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
Detroit news

144
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
And we met him at the Fiat section of the auto show end

145
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
What's this

146
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,735
Beautiful car I think anyway the Fiat 500

147
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
In order to bring this from Italy

148
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
Words you can drive it all over the place to America

149
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
Had to change a bunch of things

150
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Including

151
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
The windshield wipers

152
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
American regulations

153
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Require

154
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
That the windshield wiper

155
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Capture a larger

156
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
Part of the windshield

157
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,631
Versus European ones

158
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,447
What is the logic behind

159
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
You know I I I

160
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,007
I guess

161
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
America's Best

162
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:41,919
Therefore they would be looking at a different part I mean I'm struggling here I agree with you to come up with a rationalization

163
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
Yeah some of the regulation seem totally arbitrary

164
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,879
Like the very fact that a rule exist at all for the things you've kind of crazy let alone that there are two

165
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
Rules in different countries

166
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
Like we found these

167
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
Two brand-new Porsches

168
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,583
On the show Floor One Porsche for the us and one for Europe

169
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,143
Did two different colored eyes

170
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
Turn signal

171
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
Visit Porsche Panamera

172
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,799
I'm looking the US version we had the Amber turn signal indicator or is here

173
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
On the German version we've got the clear

174
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
That is actually

175
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
A law that is a rule

176
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,503
We don't care if your car is worth $1000000 and his car is

177
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
Is worth $1000000

178
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,343
You have to have an Amber turn signal in America

179
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,671
And you have to swap out this little piece of plastic if you're in Europe

180
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
This may sound

181
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,535
Kind of silly but the rules go from the very small

182
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
To the very big

183
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Because

184
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,423
A car can be a very big and very serious

185
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,495
Because cars can kill you

186
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
Which is why the government feels like they have a compelling interest to get all up in how you make your car until you what you

187
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Can and cannot do

188
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,503
Cars are one of the leading causes of death in the sky

189
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
Different countries have

190
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
Different assumptions about

191
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,647
Exactly how these cars are going to kill you

192
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
Pek crash test

193
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:04,095
In Europe you have to put Crash Test Dummies into a car and you drive that car into a wall head-on

194
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,703
But the US also looks at what it'll be like if the crash happens at a slight angle

195
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
A small difference

196
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
But it

197
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,287
Big deal for designers

198
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
Because this presents them with a problem now

199
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
A car company

200
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,199
Design a car that will withstand both kinds

201
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,527
The car that would be legal in both United States and Europe and a lot of

202
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
Used super luxury cars

203
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Do this

204
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,927
But it could be really expensive to make the flame that way until

205
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,767
What a lot of other car companies do is they do this or the second most expensive

206
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,631
They just redesign the car they say this one's for us this one's for Europe and they re crashing

207
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
A retest you might think I did

208
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
First Edge

209
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
Assume that Europe is just a C4

210
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,591
Ways to drive and in the US they are more left

211
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,151
Figured in Europe they're more strict

212
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
Soap in Europe they're probably

213
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,551
But this is not the case everyone tells us and studies back this up

214
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,135
The in general intake all the regulations with Europe in the US

215
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
Both places

216
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,183
Are pretty safe

217
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
They're just different

218
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,279
The US may require a certain test like this

219
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,399
Speed in Europe may require more kinds of tests but doesn't result in significant difference

220
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
In the number of death

221
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
Difference is almost

222
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
A philosophical one

223
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,519
What does it mean

224
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
To make a car say

225
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
There's one big philosophical

226
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Sprint switches

227
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
Who are the rules designs

228
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Protect

229
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
So in the US

230
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,247
Cars are tested

231
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
To make sure that

232
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
People inside the car are for

233
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
Did the driver in the

234
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
In Europe

235
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,439
Cars are also tested to see if they protect

236
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
Pedestrian

237
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,023
People walking in front of the car

238
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:42,399
Cities are denser they drive less so European Regulators want the front of their cars

239
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Basically softer

240
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,007
The guy rep forces

241
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,335
The Hudson in Europe actually have to have it

242
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Standard than in

243
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
What states have to be able to

244
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
For lack of better term absorb

245
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
Somebody's head hitting the hood of the car were to hit

246
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
A pedestrian

247
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,159
If if I'm walking around the car show and I'm hit like a car if I'm a pedestrian hit by a car

248
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,767
It's probably better to be hit by a car on the European standards and is willing American

249
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
UB

250
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
According to the standards you be safer

251
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,703
So if your us car company and you want to sell your car in Europe

252
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,543
You got to make sure the hood crumples and absorbs the impact of

253
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
Say in Italian

254
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,991
Also you have to smooth out the surfaces of the car because in Europe apparently their concern

255
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
Earned it someone's going to accidentally

256
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
Cut themselves or hurt themselves on the outside of a

257
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
And this is a test

258
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,647
Yep require

259
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
The baby head test

260
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
Do all the European cars have to meet this test

261
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
The baby head

262
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
Cast they don't use actual baby head

263
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,399
But they roll a ball about the size of a baby head

264
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,423
Oliver the car

265
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Make sure there are no

266
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Sharp edge

267
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
It's all done biking

268
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
So the cars look smoother than they used to

269
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,871
Maybe the baby head test mix

270
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
Sense in having smoother cars

271
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Is C4 thinking

272
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,087
What is an Amber turn signal really better than a clear one or vice versa

273
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,695
The question is why haven't at this point all the regulators

274
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
Comment or room and sort of

275
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Just voted

276
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
Look at all the data

277
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,607
Decided what works best what's the safest thing to do

278
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
And then just

279
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
And then enforce

280
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,471
The same set of Standards all over

281
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,055
The world that normally wouldn't encounter something like this a trade barrier

282
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
We look for the person who is

283
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
Pushing for it

284
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,271
It's usually some industry or some farmer wants to be protected and they go to the government and they demand or rule set

285
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Regulations

286
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
It keeps out foreign car

287
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Competition

288
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,391
But this is different than car regulations

289
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,207
It is hated by all of the car companies

290
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Equally

291
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,535
We couldn't find anyone who want these differ

292
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
It protects no one in particular

293
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
And the car company say

294
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
It actually hurts them all

295
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
But it's not up to that

296
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,751
If it were we would have one simple list for everyone

297
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
That's what a global engineer Cadillac.

298
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:03,199
You think if all the companies in the auto show right now they're set together you guys could just come up with what the list would be

299
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,015
Everybody feels this way huh

300
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,343
We could know I absolutely would be would make life so much simpler

301
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,647
And I could use the same part around the world

302
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,487
Without all the unique testing and certification requirement in design

303
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:20,607
And it it gets to exhaust systems and it gets the seatbelts and it gets the glass and it

304
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,631
Guess the mirror

305
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
In tires and

306
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
It's Millions

307
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Just not thousand

308
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
Kansas millions of dollars

309
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
Annually to make sure that our

310
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:35,199
Vehicles meet the requirements of the global market we sell Cadillacs in over 40 countries around the world

311
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,551
Just imagine wooley Cadillac off the production line in the US and just

312
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
Sending it out anywhere in the world

313
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
Testing it once

314
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
And then telling it to whoever wants to buy it

315
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
And that conceived

316
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
In the millions of dollars

317
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
Cars

318
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,815
Might be cheaper for us

319
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Because complying with

320
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Who set the rules gets

321
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Baked into the

322
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
The price

323
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Interview bigger select

324
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Cars 2

325
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
Attacking the former CEO of Hyundai

326
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
And he said there are a lot of great

327
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
Cheap fuel-efficient cars on the road in Europe

328
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
The Never

329
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
Make it here

330
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
America

331
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,735
Because it would be

332
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,319
Basically too expensive to re-engineer the cars for our

333
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
Safety standards

334
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
If you have a cheap car

335
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
You want it to be cheap

336
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,487
All around the world and if you have to do different safety standards re-engineering

337
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,767
Look at the cheap anymore

338
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
And no one's going to want to buy

339
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,839
So who's in favor of

340
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
Who likes the two separate sets of rules

341
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
The rule-makers

342
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471
The people who made the wrong

343
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,311
Each countries Regulators have their reasons and data to back up

344
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
The reason

345
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
That's why change is hard here

346
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
They've been trying for decades to come up with

347
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,759
The same set of regulations there are these working groups

348
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,807
Over in Switzerland that have been

349
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
Trying to do these things for decades

350
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,415
And the u.s. in the EU or right now working on this

351
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,255
Big free trade deal in the same conversation is happening again

352
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Can we get

353
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
1 list

354
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Standards

355
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Everyone can

356
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
It was hard at first for us

357
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
Why do we

358
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
2 difference

359
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Rules

360
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
System everyone at the car show

361
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
No one had a good amp

362
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
And when it came right down to it

363
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
It's language

364
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
We have the same human bodies

365
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
Baby heads on both sides of the Atlantic

366
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,063
And we couldn't quite figure it out until

367
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
This one moment

368
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
When we suddenly understood

369
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,695
We may all be physiologically

370
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
The same

371
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
Culturally

372
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
We're different

373
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
So

374
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,839
In American Europe we actually drive.

375
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
Take a very basic example

376
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Seat belts

377
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
In every car

378
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
You required to wear them in Europe

379
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
You are required to wear them in the United States

380
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Ring United States

381
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Let's be honest

382
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
People do not always wear their seatbelt I

383
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,479
Do not always wear a c

384
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Seat belt

385
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
You're pausing because

386
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:52,415
You want me to admit you there are times when I'm going a very short distance and it's a bad thing and you should wear your seatbelt

387
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
But their time for very short

388
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
I do not put on my

389
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
I just don't

390
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
Now

391
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
Try and run this by

392
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
A European

393
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
I found a German person

394
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
You wear your seatbelt

395
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
Yes of course

396
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Every time

397
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
It's my safety

398
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,615
You don't get that feeling like I'm just don't really want to bother

399
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
No way

400
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Never

401
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
Can you understand

402
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,271
Has some of us might feel that way

403
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
We have

404
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
I love Ruth and Germany in

405
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
It's kind of mentalities

406
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
Everybody puts on the

407
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
Seefeld and

408
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
The mentality has to follow the rules

409
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Yes

410
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,631
Tilt Clannad who is one of the car cleaners here he just looked at us like

411
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
Wework rate

412
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Now

413
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
Look at this

414
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Through The Eyes of a Reiki

415
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
They see that Americans

416
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,335
Zoe the time don't wear their seatbelt

417
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
The Germans

418
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
Philip always where there's

419
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
So when they get together when the Germans get to

420
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
Designer Arab

421
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
Back they assume everyone's wearing a seatbelt

422
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
There are bags

423
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,695
Can be smaller more targeted they know where the head of a person is going to go in a crash because of German is wearing his seatbelt

424
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
In America

425
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,791
We assume that people will break the law and

426
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:06,655
We want those people to live as well so are airbags are bigger

427
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,007
Fort some idiot who is not wearing a seatbelt who goes flying around the car

428
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
What are guys from Volkswagen

429
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:16,639
Christian Bowman he he showed us this inside their new American mod

430
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Of the golf r

431
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
The the Arabic

432
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Made in

433
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,015
In a difference

434
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,367
Ways so it protects also the unbelted

435
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Now

436
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,279
Volkswagen told us they want one set of regulations just as much

437
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
Ascp Cadillac

438
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,119
Because it will save them a lot of money

439
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,679
Clear just from talking to

440
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,031
German guy that Christian thinks is more efficient

441
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,335
Did you airbags the German Way

442
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Natsu

443
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
American Way

444
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
The problem is

445
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
Will the unbelted person

446
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,735
You don't know at which point

447
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
The hits

448
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Off the dummy

449
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
Hits the Epic

450
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
Where is

451
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
With the belted person

452
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:05,023
That is always identified and therefore it's in the ideal position

453
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
She can see the problem here

454
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,143
Right in theory all regulation should be the same

455
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
But

456
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,215
If you have two different kinds of people

457
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
And you have two different kinds of airbags that means the car manufacturers have to manufacture a different kind of dashboard for Europe in the US

458
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
At two different dashboards means

459
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Essentially

460
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
Two different car

461
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:30,367
So it's a trade barrier but it's an emotional barrier which is

462
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,671
Possibly why it is taking

463
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,975
So long to straighten this out

464
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,839

474
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,743
Okay it's been 4 years since we are the story and we called up Dave shepardson he was the car reporter at the

475
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
The Detroit News who we talk to you about the Fiat

476
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
He now works at Reuters

477
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,119
And he summed up what has

478
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
Changed in the past 4 years

479
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
The US and the EU

480
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
Still have pretty different safety standards but Dave says there's a chance that that could change soon

481
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,431
But by and large the same issues are still here

482
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,295
And then as a result the EU and us still have very different safety standards

483
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,623
The US and the EU are said to begin trade talks

484
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,743
And Dave says those talks might lead to more safety standards being harmonized
