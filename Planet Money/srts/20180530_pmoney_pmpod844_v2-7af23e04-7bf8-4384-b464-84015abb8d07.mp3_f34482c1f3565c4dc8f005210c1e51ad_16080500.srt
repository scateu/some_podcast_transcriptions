1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,048
Little round the world race

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,096
And you can see the same kind of drama

3
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,120
Playing out over

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,912
Two sides

5
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,936
In a standoff

6
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,728
On the brink of some kind of con

7
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,312
So we have few nuclear situation with North Korea

8
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:17,920
There is this on-again off-again possible trade war with China

9
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
And it might not seem like it on its face

10
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,040
But these global conflict follow a pattern

11
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,064
That we see

12
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
Everywhere

13
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,672
Down to the tiniest little ways in our own daily lives

14
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
Like

15
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,536
Two roommates who are watching the dirty dishes piled up in the sink

16
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,608
Waiting for the other one to give up and clean them first

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,168
These are all problems were both sides are better off

18
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
If the corporate

19
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,752
But no one wants me to suck her in cave first

20
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,032
So they don't

21
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,568
And they end up not cooperate

22
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:50,176
This kind of stand-up is so, it comes up so often and it is so tricky to solve

23
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,200
It has its own name

24
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:56,064
The prisoner's dilemma

25
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Alex goldmark the prisoner's dilemma is one of the most famous products

. more than ever this little thought experiment is explaining so much of our world right now that we just

28
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,032
Have to tell this particular story

29
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
Trailer show the story of the idealistic glorious dirt who set up the solve one of the greatest problem

30
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:28,064
Human existence it right here what he found out with it sometimes the best way to win

39
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000
Cooperation

00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Bob Axelrod

00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
Lifeline PCS

42
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:16,192
Yes I've done mediator or try to help each side understand the other

43
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,520
Barbies and quite sure where is obsession with cooperation came from

44
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
Maybe it was growing up during the Cold War

45
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,640
Or maybe it's the fact that he was the youngest in his family

46
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,736
I think my motivation was more from my parents who bicker a lot

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,856
And I thought that's a shame and what it comes with it

48
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
They should be able to get along better

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
Bob went on to become a professor at the

50
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
Versity of Michigan employee

51
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Science and public

52
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
Policy

53
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
And now instead of worrying about his

54
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
His parents bickering

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
He's worrying about something

56
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,216
Yeah to Country bickering the United States and the Soviet Union

57
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520
In the 1970s and 1980s

58
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
We were all worried about

59
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,592
Global thermonuclear war

60
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896
And Bob is trying to figure out how to solve this

61
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
He looks around thinking

62
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
What could I a professor at a Midwestern University

63
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Possibly do

64
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,576
And he

65
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
See something that in

66
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
The budding technology

67
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Specifically

68
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
Computers that play chess

69
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
Application right now

70
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
This is

71
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
My most beloved toys from my childhood 1978 Fidelity Electronics

72
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,568
Challenger computer chess I love that you brought this in

73
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,200
It's in a whole special briefcase calculator attached to a

74
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
Mini metal chest

75
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,552
Board that amazing

76
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
Sorry Italy

77
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,952
I so he sees these computers Eastchester

78
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
Thanks

79
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,840
Maybe he can use computers to try and figure out the smartest strategy for

80
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
Global conflict

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,752
I was inspired by a computer chess tournaments we're obviously if you're going to write a program to play computer chess

82
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,824
Give me a very sophisticated you can handle any contingencies

83
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
The first step that was he needs to

84
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Frameless

85
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,456
Political problems in the where computer can handle

86
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
And he chooses

87
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
That famous thought experiment

88
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Prisoner's dilemma

89
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
Quality the name comes from the

90
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
The story about

91
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
Police arresting two people might have

92
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
Committed a crime and they

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
The prisoner's dilemma is so important

94
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
The story that

95
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
We are going to play this out

96
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,679
As if it were real life so

97
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
I just pulled my lunch

98
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
Out of the fridge

99
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
And there's a mystery

100
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
I turkey sandwiches missing

101
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,735
Let's Round Up The Usual Suspects to The Newsroom

102
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,807
Sarah

103
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
Sarah Sarah Sarah

104
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
I bet you're wondering why we brought you in here

105
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,743
Oh yeah that laugh that laughs tells me you know exactly

106
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
Why

107
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,279
We brought

108
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,607
You in here you a Cardiff Garcia

109
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,167
Took the turkey sandwich out of the fridge

110
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
Oh I'm sorry

111
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
This is light too bright

112
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,287
Alex is in the other studio with Cardiff

113
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,127
Coming in here Cardiff listen we know that Roberts lunch

114
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Has been stolen

115
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
You don't know nothing

116
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
Here's the deal you got to make a choice

117
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
You got to decide are you going to keep your mouth shut

118
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,831
Where are you going to rat Sera out

119
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,415
Because if you write Sarah out and you let her take the Fall by yourself

120
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
Will let you go free

121
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,255
Here's the twist if you rat you out and you rat him out

122
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
When you're both going to get punished pretty harshly

123
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
If neither of you Rats on the other one we're still going to punch you

124
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
If neither of you talk

125
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
Both of you will get the Lesser

126
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
Just got suspended for one week

127
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
The only way you can walk free

128
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
Is by telling us Cardiff

129
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
And

130
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Aren't you can leave now

131
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
Thank you I'm going to need a sandwich bag

132
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
Gas card

133
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Alex

134
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,231
Comebackszn alright Robert

135
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
To looking at this ideally

136
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
Ideally what should Cardiff and Sara

137
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
If they trust each other they should keep their mouth shut

138
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,471
That would overall be the best thing for both of them

139
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
But if they don't trust each other and rubber

140
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
They are criminals

141
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,895
Then it might be in their individual best interest to sing like a

142
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,735
It's on the railroad these kinds of situations don't just get played out

143
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
Once in awhile

144
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:20,159
Giddy up its kind of conflicts happen over and over again and say you keep bringing Sarah and Kardashian and Sarah speaking nut

145
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,487
Just about what to do but what did Cardinals do last time

146
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
And he's thinking we'll wait what did Sarah do last time

147
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
And so on and so

148
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
And this is essentially what a trade

149
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
Is between say the US

150
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
And China

151
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,031
They are just picking Terrace once in setting those levels they're thinking

152
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,823
What did the other side do

153
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
And all the round up to

154
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,687
And what is that tell me about what they're going to do next

155
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
There's literally a billion options

156
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
And you know who love

157
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,783
Sifting through a billion options

158
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:49,855
Computers

159
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
And Bob axle

160
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,463
So Bob thinks there might be a best way to

161
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,279
Play the prisoner's dilemma of all the billions of options

162
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:02,143
And that he can find so goes to the library and looks up everyone he can find

163
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,935
Play written about the prisoner's dilemma

164
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,519
And he picked up the Fast and the brightest in the biggest brains he get in touch with

165
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Any got their dresses

166
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,615
I what I did is I will to other

167
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,687
A faculty members who had written about the prisoners

168
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
Writing a letter like

169
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
Yeah mail

170
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
Snellville

171
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,415
And I said you know I'm interested in and higher what's a good way to play the game and you've written about this could you

172
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
Pick a strategy

173
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
Define it in terms of a computer program

174
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
And he had one of those computer terminals

175
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,655
And back in the 1970s they were usually these beige boxes

176
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:41,055
Bright green glowing cursors and he takes his letters and he somehow has to get them in

177
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Side

178
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
The Box

179
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
The first round I did all by myself

180
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,175
Oh you where the nerd I was

181
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Sorry

182
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
Basically inside

183
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,343
The computer he designs a virtual prison

184
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
With two

185
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Virtual prisoner

186
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
Kept separate

187
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
Player one

188
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Tire tube

189
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:06,143
Each prisoner is given a particular strategy one of the strategy sent in by the experts and they play hundred

190
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Frowns

191
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
Against

192
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Each other

193
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
With those strategies

194
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
And then

195
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
They get to new strategies

196
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,567
Play again

197
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Computer course

198
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,455
Differences one strategy was really simple be random

199
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
Sometimes you keep your mouth

200
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
Shut and cooperate with the other prisoner

201
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
And sometimes you write amount

202
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
Heat affect another strategy

203
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
Way more complicated

204
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
It was like an early version of artificial

205
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Intelligence

206
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
The strategy was called

207
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Look ahead

208
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Atom model

209
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,863
What the other player was doing

210
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
How often would it

211
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,215
Cooperate after cooperation how I feel crappy.

212
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
Affection

213
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:48,127
And then it would project into the future if my model the other person's correct what's the best I can do with that kind of

214
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
Player it was when called tranquilizer that loaded

215
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
Deponent into thinking it was very cooperative

216
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
Lights out lots of

217
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
Directions

218
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,903
Wauna, sent in an approach called Grim trigger

219
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
It was just a giant

220
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,487
Complete and total threat

221
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
If you read it against it once

222
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,375
It would just affect on you afterwards forever and ever meant to scare the opponent

223
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Cooperating

224
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
And there was another super simple strategy

225
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Tit for Tat

226
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
Just do what the other side does back to the

227
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,823
214 different strategies

228
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,383
Lined up ready for a tournament inside this

229
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,919
Virtual prison inside this

230
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
Old school computer

231
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
Which took a while to process back in the

232
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,807
So wait what did you what did you do during this

233
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,855
Two hours while it's turning away

234
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Had lunch

235
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Okay

236
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,791
You just said it to go on your computer and your husband you walked away

237
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Sure

238
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
He's a pretty chill tour

239
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
So who wins

240
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:49,567
The Grim trigger the tranquilizer that super fancy artificial intelligence one you go in you look at this list

241
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
And what do you say

242
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
I see that

243
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,967
The simplest of all the strategies was the one that did best

244
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
Which was

245
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
Tit for Tat

246
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Tit for Tat

247
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
Worst name

248
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Fast results

249
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:05,183
This round anyway like any good researcher Bob

250
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Was

251
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Doubtful

252
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,279
What's the result how can a simple strategy really be

253
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
You the best so

254
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,119
Bob decided to do the whole tournament

255
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,679
And so what I did is I

256
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
Scented announcement

257
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,287
Several computer hobby magazine saying

258
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
Here's what the prisoners Monday is I'm going to run to

259
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,199
A tournament and any happiest anybody that wants consenso

260
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
Some strategy in

261
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,783
That's amazing

262
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:37,183
You know they could be young Bill Gates Steve Jobs they're reading this in the back of the neck

263
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Time to think about

264
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Play with it

265
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
He got 63 competitor

266
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
All of them going to take down simpleton

267
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,655
And this time it took the entire night for his computer

268
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
To have all of those prisoners plate

269
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
You go home overnight

270
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:56,895
Get up in the morning to drink coffee but this is 30 years ago

271
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Remember printing off the result

272
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
And so it was a whole bunch of pages

273
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,271
And I had a tape them together

274
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
To make this one huge spreadsheet

275
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
And lo and behold it was

276
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
Pacific a strategy again

277
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Wow that's

278
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
That is really cool

279
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:14,815
Bob's tournament was revealing something fundamental about how people can get along with

280
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
And it's all wrapped up

281
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
In simple tit-for-tat

282
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
Here's how the tit-for-tat strategy War

283
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,567
The strategy says that the first time you walk in you assume the best from the other prisoner

284
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:30,431
And you do not wrap them out I used to work nice I said a nice rule is one that won't be the first

285
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
And I found that the nice rules

286
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
I actually did quite well

287
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Right to start nice

288
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
You can't be nice all the

289
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
If you're playing against the Grim trigger you have to

290
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,743
If the other side is taking advantage of you and you don't do anything about it

291
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
I'm just going to try again harder

292
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
Settings

293
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
Straight you have to

294
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,751
Demonstrate that don't have consequences for their Bad Axe if your opponent is nice you stay nice

295
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
If your opponent hits you you hit back

296
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
But you still look the other side and think

297
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,895
Think about how to know

298
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,919
What they're going to

299
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:05,503
How to send a message that cooperation is the best in the long run

300
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,039
And that you will play next

301
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:11,135
There's something very special about tit-for-tat special to my heart for real

302
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
It never tries to beat

303
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
It's opponent remember

304
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
It won't affect unless it

305
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Is provoke

306
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,327
So that in the short-term and anyone around

307
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
The best of it can do

308
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
Is Thai

309
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,423
But in the long run

310
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Even if it

311
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Loses

312
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Some one-on-one matchups

313
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Buy a little bit

314
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
It ends up better off overall

315
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,967
You do not as well as the other player but you do boo terrific and the reason you do terrific

316
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,783
Is you elicit a lot of cooperation for dinner

317
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
The other player to do well is Tit for Tat

318
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Needs to cooperate a lot

319
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
Otherwise it gets punished

320
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
I think there's something

321
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,023
Beautiful and poetic and hopeful

322
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
About the idea that

323
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,399
The strategy that does the best in the long run

324
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,239
Is the one that never actually tries to beat its opponent

325
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Exactly

326
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
Bob Axelrod publishes his results

327
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,407
80 and he sits back and waits for peace to breakout around the world

328
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
David from the White House call

329
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
Okay

330
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
Neither dinner later

331
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
But after he runs the store

332
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
And crowns tit-for-tat the two-time champion

333
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,439
Bob realizes

334
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
There is a

335
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
Serious

336
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Problem here

337
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,815
Tit-for-tat has a dark side in

338
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,423
Say two countries are negotiating something in

339
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
And

340
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,775
One of them says or does something that the other side

341
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
Interprets as

342
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
An insult or maybe even

343
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
A threat

344
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
Well then if both sides are doing it for

345
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
For tat

346
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
All it takes is one misunderstanding

347
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,087
Then this can set off a chain reaction

348
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,159
In the world of miscommunication if you have two sides doing

349
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
Tap

350
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:54,559
Then you can start defecting against each other and you defect all the way down to annihilation

351
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Tell Bob

352
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,399
Figure this out a bit late for his tournament but he comes up with a solution

353
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
And that's two

354
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Just a tiny little tweak

355
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Tit for Tat

356
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,031
He called

357
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Generous

358
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
This version says

359
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
Yes

360
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
Retaliate when you are provoked

361
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
But also sometimes

362
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
Turn the other cheek

363
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
That simple

364
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,087
So when you see two countries in a standoff over

365
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
A nuclear deal or

366
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Trade barriers

367
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:26,559
Easy to think that the back-and-forth is a petit irrational tit-for-tat it's going to bring the whole thing Crashing Down

368
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
Look for the generous moment

369
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,543
We're at it doesn't earn attack back it might just be The Optimist

370
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,943
Strategy for cooperation
