Progressive capitalism for an age of discontent

Today Show originally aired back in 2016 and we have an update for

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,992
At the very end

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:27,392
Last year on Valentine's Day Fred Ruckel was sitting on his couch at his house in Upstate New York

11
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,952
And his wife Natasha was playing the piano for

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
What are you playing

13
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
Something she made up

14
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:37,376
Sometimes I just sit there and let my fingers go and see what Tunes melodies

15
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,936
Come out and emigrate but Fred loves him

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
I love them

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:46,848
Actually paying that much attention to the music he was paying attention to this new little kitten that they've gotten

18
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,872
So who is this

19
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,432
But she can introduce yourself with this is Yoda

20
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,968
Hey Kitty we say something

21
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,576
At some point I'm going to have to get Yoda to meow

22
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,160
Got to get the sound of the cat radio when I want to try to meow

23
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,440
We'll get to that

24
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,488
Anyway friends playing with

25
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,304
The kitten and he takes a little toy mouse that Yoda has a

26
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,608
Throws it across the room and it slides across

27
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:12,960
The floor and they have a rug that's a little bit rumpled up and the mouse slides across the

28
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
Therefore right into one of the little rumbles in the rug

29
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
And the cat

30
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
Goes

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
Bananas

32
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,736
And she immediately attacked it just ran and started putting her paws underneath then playing with it and

33
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,576
Fred said nice out there we said we going to make the Ripple rug and I looked

34
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,368
What you mean what's the Ripple rug

35
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
Ripple rug

36
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
The Ripple rug

37
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,464
The Ripple rug is a cat

38
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
It is basically the size

39
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
Of a doormat

40
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
Robert in the show you

41
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
The Ripple rug this is it

42
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
This is

43
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
The rebel ride

44
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,008
I don't know how to describe describe it looks like someone's taking a carpet

45
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,080
They've cut holes into it so it looks like swiss cheese and then they have

46
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,104
Wadded-up

47
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
The carpet

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,408
Turn on the floor

49
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:59,040
Yeah that's essentially the report apparently Disneyland

50
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,112
A year later Natasha and Fred are selling

51
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,648
$60,000

52
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
Ripple rugs every month

53
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
Debutantes Today Show

54
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
They have set up a shop

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
Open Amazon Marketplace

56
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
Amazon Prime

57
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,656
And the Ripple rug was one of Amazon's best-selling pet toys

58
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,448
39 99

59
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
And then one day Fred gets the

60
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Missed call from

61
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,152
My brother-in-law's like hey did you see it's on eBay cuz he's always looking at stuff on eBay

62
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
And I was like what

63
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,712
Fred was immediately to his

64
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Computer logs

65
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,880
EBay I just typed in the Ripple rug and there was already for sellers selling the Ripple rug and then every single

66
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
All day there would be five more six more

67
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
10 more

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
How much were they charging

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,816
They were going as high as 5999

70
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
That's

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
$20 more than he was selling them for on Amazon

72
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
Beastly people were scalping Ripple

73
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,800
Buying and selling them on eBay at a market

74
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
All these people who read a Natasha never met

75
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,456
We're getting rich off of their invention

76
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,576
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith and Robert Smith

77
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
The internet was supposed to get rid

78
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,904
Of the middleman

79
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,512
What they told us consumers were supposed to buy directly from manufacturers no more going to people like

80
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
Travel agents having to pay fees

81
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,632
Internet was going to be about getting stuff from the source

82
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
For a wholesale price

83
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
It did not work out that way

84
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
Just ask the makers of

85
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
The Ripple rug

86
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,592
The internet has made it so that anyone can be a middleman

87
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,384
Or a middle person

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
Middle person doesn't sound as good as middle man

89
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Screw

90
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,040

Winford Rocco saw all of these people selling the Ripple rug on eBay

107
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
He went a little nuts

108
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:19,583
He started spending hours everyday checking eBay and trying to get in touch with

109
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
The people who are selling his cats

110
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
Did you ever try to contact any of the

111
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
Mittleman

112
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,567
I have reached out to many of them I've sent cease-and-desist orders to every single one of them

113
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Well hello

114
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,615
One of them stop

115
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,711
The letters did not work and then Fred started tracking down their phone number

116
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
And personally calling them

117
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,135
I am Fred from snuggly cat the makers of the Ripple rug and calling you about you selling our product illegal alien

118
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
You know I'm not telling you

119
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Well I mean

120
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:54,143
BB guitar probably right there's nothing illegal about buying something and reselling it there's even name for it we used to

121
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,191
Arbitrage arbitrage mean

122
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
You buy something cheap in one place

123
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
You sounded expensive in another

124
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
Yes but this is a

125
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
Twist on Arbitrage called drops

126
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
And it's kind of

127
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
Genius because there is

128
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,967
Basically no risk involved at all

129
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:12,831
These people never bought a ripple in their closet and then sold

130
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
They never actually

131
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Touch the Ripple rug

132
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
They just

133
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,207
Wait until a customer buys

134
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
The Ripple rug from them

135
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,559
And then they buy it from the Amazon store

136
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
And ship it directly from Amazon

137
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
To the Past

138
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
And the customers

139
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:33,567
Have no idea where the River Run comes from all I know is they paid $60 instead of $40 and the Ripple rug

140
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
Showed up they thought it came from

141
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Clevermade

142
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
Exactly and the dropshipper can just pocket the difference

143
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,759
Okay it is easy to resent

144
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
People who have found a way to make some easy money

145
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,391
This is good for Fred this is goodbye

146
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
For Fred and Natasha and for the Ripple rug

147
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
Because this

148
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
Lita

149
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,791
Middleman whoever they are there advertising

150
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
The product

151
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,143
And yeah they're adding money to an aggravated making a profit but they act

152
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
It's the sort of

153
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,935
We have sales

154
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Out there pushing Ripple rug

155
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
Getting into people's hands

156
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
Yes they don't actually do any of the work

157
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
But they were making more sales

158
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,175
But Fred says there are a couple of problems

159
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,759
The first is that he is trying to build a brand

160
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,831
It's not just about selling one ripplerock it's about building the snuggle

161
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
Cat brand so part of

162
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,439
A luxury cat toys

163
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
Christ is a big part of

164
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,303
Branding and so he wants to control his Brandy wants to control the prices

165
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,119
What is product doesn't want people selling it for all kinds of different

166
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,703
But the real problem was if he says he was losing money

167
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
Because what was happening

168
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
These people were ordering this product on eBay

169
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,359
And the Box showing up at their doorstep was from Amazon

170
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,967
Two people get confused they would look up the product on Amazon and they would realize

171
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
They said they had paid $20 more

172
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
For the rubber rug needed to pay

173
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,159
And so they would think I'm just going to return it to eBay and

174
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Order from Amazon

175
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
Let's say you feel cheated you say I want to return it cuz

176
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
It's 3999

177
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
Honey you know Amazon for real

178
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,911
I paid 5999 they're both free shipping and free returns

179
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
I'll return this one order from there

180
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
But you're not returning the product

181
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
To the middleman

182
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,591
To the people I mean by you're really Return of the product

183
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
Back to front

184
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,687
And that comes with a whole boatload of feasible

185
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,503
Apparently so Amazon charges fees all along the way they have a fever

186
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
For the purchase of

187
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Before shipping it

188
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Thank you for the return if

189
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Restocking

190
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
And then when the customer reorders it from Amazon

191
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
There's another

192
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Another

193
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,535
Sprint has a lot of times the rugs with comeback used

194
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
So he had to

195
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Just right then he couldn't

196
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Resell them

197
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
And just two months after

198
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,215
Fred noticed all these dropshippers on eBay

199
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
He said he had over 200

200
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
Which was over 10000 losses in

201
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,359
Just a couple of months

202
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,943
You lost $10,000 in 2 months into months

203
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
Meanwhile the eBay people

204
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,855
All the people who are charging $60 for this pocketing the extra $20 different

205
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
They get to keep the money yeah they're not paying any of the

206
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
The geniuses

207
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
Do you want me to go first you can go first back

208
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,071
Okay I'm first all right though hello my name is Nikki with a

209
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
Hello my name is Parrish Witherspoon

210
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,447
Nicki and parashar dropshippers I talked to them on Skype

211
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,335
And the city never sold the Ripple rug but they do sell tons of cat toys and household products in

212
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
Supplies and all kinds of things on eBay store

213
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
And with the make any of those things

214
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,735
They don't have possession of any of those things they just

215
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Mark up the price

216
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,527
And send them on to

217
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
The customer that is what they do

218
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,159
America got started in this business when they were both living in Baghdad

219
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,719
In Iraq they were working for private contractors

220
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,535
And they were spending all of their time

221
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
Buying stuff online

222
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
You know groceries and household type stuff

223
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Furniture

224
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
We bought a car online

225
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,287
We bought a house online we bought a dog online

226
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
Adam schitt

227
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:54,015
Dodging ships from Oklahoma to Iraq we sure did that wasn't

228
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:59,647
Nicky and Paris are very familiar with buying things online and they decide to give dropshipping

229
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
A try

230
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
The sign up for the company called

231
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,023
DS Domination PS4 Dropship

232
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
Exactly

233
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,655
And think it's software that helps them find these best selling products on Amazon

234
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:17,055
Copy the images from Amazon set up a little store on eBay and figure out how much to charge for these

235
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
These products if they're dropped

236
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
They start out selling mostly.

237
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Toys and Novelty

238
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
See items and almost right away

239
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,247
She says she realizes

240
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
This is going to be

241
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
Be a big

242
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
I'll never forget it it was like an Angry Birds Star Wars set that we had got and it it took off in

243
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
In less than 48 hours

244
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,815
I mean you just kind of sit back and you're like

245
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
I just paid

246
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,399
$0.30 for this item and it

247
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,447
It's old were like 9 bucks

248
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
About 30 times today

249
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
You know

250
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
It was just an amazing feeling

251
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
An amazing profit

252
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,175
I'm just did that one day they made you know what

253
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
Twitter 60 bucks

254
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,503
Yeah nothing yeah

255
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,879
And after just a few months of this they were making enough money that they were both able to quit their jobs in a rock and

256
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
And moved back to the US

257
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
To Houston

258
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,767
And now they say they make more than a million dollars a year in sales

259
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Steve

260
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
No they were selling like dumb little toys

261
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,911
Well they've expanded into a whole bunch of other thing

262
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Think they're wholesaling now and

263
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
Doing private label stuff but

264
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,079
Nikki told me they will never stop doing the drop ship

265
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,639
It's just it's just too easy

266
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,735
Portsmouth. Some some tools in there that kind of automate everything

267
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,599
Really just a matter of pressing a button and your stores kind of ran for you

268
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,927
So you know what that that's profit that

269
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,767
You know if it's that easy to do why would we not keep it you know

270
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
Did you ever feel like

271
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,607
We're not actually doing anything we're just

272
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:49,727
We're just charging to post it you don't even like you're not adding anything to the product or anything like that

273
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
Did you feel weird about that

274
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
Not not really honestly

275
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,199
You know when you're actually doing it it does require some work you're having to do the tracking

276
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,527
You know I'm a say for instance if Amazon is is out of

277
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
Parts of a particular item

278
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:10,463
I'm get to go to a national retail location grab that item put in the Box make sure your customer gets it you're doing all the cuss

279
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,791
Customer service you're making sure that that customer is happy

280
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,839
There's no issues with it

281
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,191
And you know Caitlin control I mean if you're doing the whole thing

282
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,471
When you put it that way

283
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,263
They sound like a retail

284
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
They sound like a retail store that wants

285
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
Customers to return

286
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
And even though they don't make

287
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,199
The products are even really even ship the body to touch the products

288
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,991
They're the public face

289
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Of the prompt

290
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,575
Yeah in a lot of ways retailers are

291
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Just mittleman

292
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,415
But to Fred and Natasha the cat rug makers

293
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
Guys on the internet or just scalp

294
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,767
They were making the products a lot more expensive

295
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Customers

296
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
They were not adding anything to it

297
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,911
Jason feifer is the editor-in-chief of Entrepreneur magazine

298
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:55,519
He wrote about the ruckles and dropshipping if there's a bad guy in this story

299
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
Really

300
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
It's us

301
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
What know it's us

302
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
Have you ever bought anything on eBay

303
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Yes

304
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Did you ever

305
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
Think where it came from

306
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,087
No seller

307
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,903
The Cellar right there yeah you don't know where it came from

308
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
That mentality

309
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
Create this opportunity

310
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Still with our fault because

311
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:23,423
We aren't shopping around we cuz we're not searching for the original Ripple rug at the original $40

312
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,983
Exactly we don't want to look around on the internet

313
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,543
It's so the middle men are saving us a couple of keystroke

314
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,079
A few seconds here and there

315
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
Yeah and we are willing to

316
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,687
To pay for that $5 10 dollars $20 we are paying for that

317
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
All I have to do is go to another website

318
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
NC

319
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
The prices differ

320
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
And I don't

321
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,391
It's crazy like why am I not doing that

322
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,207
I mean as long as we are all willing to

323
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
Taken advantage of by

324
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
Different Market

325
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,351
Places even though we have all the information in front of us

326
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:56,191
It would literally Take 5 Seconds no time at all

327
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
And we don't do it

328
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
So if we're not going to do it

329
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,847
Why can't people take advantage of us

330
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
We are the problem

331
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,919
Like this gets to something

332
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,807
Because although economics treat us like economically rational beings always hunting for the best price

333
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
The truth is

334
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
We are all deeply lazy

335
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Inside

336
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
And

337
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
There's always someone who will help us

338
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
Be a little bit lazier

339
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
For a profit

340
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,631
And I guess it's always with all that you know one-click shopping the internet has made us

341
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
Lazier

342
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,727
And it's simultaneously created all these opportunities for

343
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:34,335
For people to jump in and make things even easier but to take a little slice of the profit here

344
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Exactly

345
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Do you like save us a couple

346
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
Spooky strokes and Charters little more

347
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,735
Michael Munger is an economist at Duke

348
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
He has been studying the middleman for years

349
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,903
All you have to do is have a computer with a connection to the internet the ability to write code

350
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,743
And you can be a middleman it's the most competitive industry the world has ever known

351
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Being a middleman

352
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,863
Being a middleman that's what people all over the world want to do

353
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
I want to write an app

354
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
That will sell and I'll make a lot of money but the app itself can't make any good or service all I can do is

355
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Bring together

356
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,175
A buyer and a seller who otherwise wouldn't have met that's the essence of being a middleman

357
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,759
Think about it a lot of the hottest companies in the world right now are

358
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Essentially just middlemen

359
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:18,367
Yeah and we don't even think of them as middleman right or I'm going to get an Uber

360
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,511
That's what I say I'm going to Uber so a car is going to show up Uber all over is a middleman between me

361
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
Add a driver they don't own any car

362
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
Cars they don't employ any drivers

363
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,167
They just take a slice of profit for connecting the two of us

364
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
Same with Airbnb

365
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Kayak

366
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,311
EBay and Amazon Alibaba all just

367
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Middleman

368
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
So

369
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,151
The future of the economy is really

370
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
Becoming more and more about

371
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Middleman

372
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
Getting people

373
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
Much much much more efficiently

374
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
2

375
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,463
Goods and services you're not going far enough it's about almost nothing else

376
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,767
Is more middle name

377
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Good

378
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,863
That's like asking is gravity good

379
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,167
We are comparing middlemen to gravity

380
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,519
I'm comparing the economic logic of selling reductions in transactions

381
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
Irresistible inevitable

382
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,919
So inevitable but even middlemen are worried

383
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,687
About middle

384
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
No

385
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Yes

386
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,295
Nikki and Parrish Witherspoon the Amazon to eBay drops

387
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,623
Shippers would not even give me the name of their store on

388
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:27,743
Because they were worried that someone would go to their store copy all the items they were selling

389
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
Set up their own store

390
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
And sell them for a little bit less

391
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,423
People that are lazy will go in instead of doing the research like we did

392
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
We'll just go and take what you having

393
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
You start selling it

394
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
They're not going to have to do the work

395
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
But you did to go research the item

396
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,383
Dropshipping way I thought like

397
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,175
The whole is not the whole thing

398
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,967
Absolutely it

399
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,831
It is absolutely it that you don't find it's not for you to call

400
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Copy other

401
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
Right right that's why I was

402
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,975
But their whole business is copying other people

403
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
Yes but they said that they know things they gotten

404
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,351
Really good at their business of theirs and they don't want somebody stealing their ideas

405
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Middleman

406
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,935
Are like gravity there just inevitable

407
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,263
Call me if there's any little bit of profit left on the table somewhere

408
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Someone is going to grab

409
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
There is one man who has decided to fight

410
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
To fight the middleman

411
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
Fred Ruckel

412
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Are Ripple rug maker

413
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
He was spending hours a day

414
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
Trying to shut down

415
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
Dropshippers

416
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,623
First thing in the morning check for arbitrageurs last thing at night

417
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,463
Check for Arbitrage to send out any cease-and-desist before or after

418
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,303
It was taking up inordinate amount of time and it was a super stressful

419
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,863
A couple months ago Fred did something

420
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
Drastic

421
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,215
Keep hold the Ripple rug off of the Amazon Prime Market

422
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,799
No more free Prime shipping Amazon store

423
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
That is where the arbitrageur

424
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,431
We pulled out of the hole in Prime shipping thing in May

425
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,759
And at that point we were over 60000 a month in sales

426
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
And in a blink

427
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
60000 went down to

428
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
$25

429
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,903
Oh my gosh

430
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
That's a big price you paid

431
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,975
I would say it was a huge price

432
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
Is it worth it

433
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,583
Well we had put together

434
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,167
Really that's all I mean that's so much money that's like

435
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Integrity is important

436
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,311
Stress Factory trust so we removed all the stress

437
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,127
Bread and Atasha started doing all of their own shipping

438
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
And they converted their garage into

439
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
A little pack

440
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,455
King facility

441
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,991
Gotten really good with those

442
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Envelopes

443
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,903
And the night before I saw them they both been up until midnight

444
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,463
A video had gone up online with a couple of

445
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:39,327
Cat celebrities minor cat celebrities named Cole and marmalade playing on a ripple rug

446
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
An order

447
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Had been pouring in

448
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:47,519
And so we spent two hours each packing last night and then this morning we spent another two hours each packing

449
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
That's 8 hours

450
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
For one person right there

451
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,663
Pimp so this isn't make you wish slightly that you were still

452
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
Using Amazon to do all the shipping

453
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
People would be arbitraging our products

454
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
I don't know if they see it seems like

455
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,599
Everybody's

456
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Losing out of

457
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,951
This decision threatened to Tasha are losing money they're not selling it

458
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,023
Beat the dropshippers the arbitrageurs

459
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
They're not making as much money reselling these things

460
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
And their product

461
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,399
Which seems like a great product

462
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,799
Is harder to get cats everywhere are suffering because Fred and Natasha won't just suck it

463
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
Shut up and deal with the middleman

464
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
All of that is true

465
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
But there's an emotional component

466
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,479
And Fred and Natasha invented this

467
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,319
They felt a lot of ownership for it and to them

468
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
It felt like people were coming in

469
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,647
And taking like a bite out of

470
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
The Sting Main Event they were

471
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,975
Essentially sort of stealing their product

472
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Acton Subway

473
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
And for frigid Ashley just wanted

474
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,631
Control back they didn't want to be up at night and up in the morning trying to

475
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,679
Polder products back from all of these differ

476
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Forces

477
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,799
They just wanted total control vent and the loss of money they told me it was worth it today

478
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,383
Now for the Natasha are mostly selling Ripple rugs Direct

479
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,967
We from their website and they told me sales are starting to come back after

480
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
For the initial Bay

481
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
Big drop off

482
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,087
And they were very pleased to say in the last 4 months

483
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
They have only had

484
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
To return

485
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,375
Will you meow

486
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,703
Kitty kitty kitty

487
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:25,567
Kitty kitty kitty

488
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,919
We reached out to both Amazon and eBay Amazon did not get back to us

489
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,735
EBay did respond saying that dropshipping

490
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,527
Is not against its rules

It's Stacey it is now it 2019

511
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:21,119
Simpsons episode first aired Fred and Natasha say they have largely solved their Dropship

512
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
They have a new problem

513
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
Counterfeit

514
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
Of course Fred and Natasha Archer

515
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
Termans to fight the counter

516
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,383
They told us about this one group that was selling fake Ripple rugs

517
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
And the way that they tracked

518
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
This one down was

519
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
Pretty ingenious

520
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
I saw a TV commercial

521
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,271
Still advertising

522
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
Ripple rug

523
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Knock off

524
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:40,831
So

525
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
They worked backwards

526
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,647
From that commercial

527
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
Because you know it looked like it had been shot in the studio

528
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:51,071
We were versus engineer their shoot for their video and knew what kind of environment and had to

529
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
To be filmed in

530
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Then we looked

531
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
For casting calls we found how they cast

532
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
The cats for the commercial

533
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:02,079
They actually had a casting call for cats or kittens on Facebook

534
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
The casting call was looking for

535
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
Quote

536
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:06,431
Kittens born to be Stars

537
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
Using

538
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
The casting call and finding different people that responded on Facebook we were able to facially track the cats back to the owner

539
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
And that's how we originally busted this open

540
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,304
Now for the Natasha are helping other in

541
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
They set up a website

542
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,400
Site called as stolen on TV.

543
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,960
That's one word as stolen on tv.com

544
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
It is a service that helps you

545
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
People take on

546
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
Their own copycats

547
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:40,736
