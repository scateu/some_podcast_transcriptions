Progressive capitalism for an age of discontent

5
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,264
By Nobel prize-winning economist

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,544
Joseph E stiglitz

7
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,616
In the very early days

8
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,384
Of satellites

9
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,224
You pretty much knew what the mission of Any Given satellite was going to be

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
Spying on the enemy

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,808
And at the time the object of Interest

12
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,856
Was pretty singular the Soviet Union

13
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,720
Robert Cargill job was to study the photos that came down from those us spy satellite

14
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:35,072
Everyday she would go to a windowless government building in Washington DC

15
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,864
Into a dimly lit room

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,424
And you would sit down at something called a light table

17
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,960
With a single photograph on it

18
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,776
And then imagine a microscope

19
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,336
Righttime now peering through a microscope

20
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,384
I'm looking at

21
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:55,040
Garrison's that have military equipment at I'm looking at test sites in which they might be employed

22
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,856
A new missile technology I'm looking at ports

23
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,440
To see what the development of their Naval capabilities are

24
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,512
Lots of people would look at the same photograph

25
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
4 hours

26
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
They called it torturing

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
And I had to torture the pixels because

28
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,192
Each and every Spy photo of the Soviet Union

29
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,496
What's incredibly rare and valuable

30
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,568
In early days of satellites would take pictures on rolls

31
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,128
Felt this was before digital photography where you could

32
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
Dim the picture back to Earth from space

33
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,016
So they're actually giant rolls of film inside of the saddle

34
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,368
And so they had to figure out a way to get that film back to Earth

35
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
From space

36
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
And they came up with this

37
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Brilliant solution

38
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,768
The program have a secret code in Corona

39
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
And the corona satellites were designed

40
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352
To take pictures

41
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
And then

42
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,240
Poop out the canister of film from the bottom of the satellite and inject it into space

43
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
Once it reaches the atmosphere it would deploy a parachute

44
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,896
I kid you not now it's floating down over the Pacific Ocean

45
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
Your spy satellite photos

46
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
Are us

47
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
Air Force plane

48
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,064
With basically a trapeze on the end of it so think of it

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Two poles in a big net

50
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,648
Would have to time it

51
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,488
So that as it floated down it flew right over top of it

52
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,584
Caught the parachute in its net that's caught the canister

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
It's it's

54
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
Inconceivable to me

55
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
There is a

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,984
Falling canister of film from space

57
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
An airplane

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
Catches in a net

59
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
In midair

60
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,384
At American ingenuity

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
In the decade since then

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
The US has

63
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Of course launched

64
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
Thousands of better satellites

65
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784
Able to beam down Millions

66
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
The photos rather than just what it could fit on a roll of film

67
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,416
And Robert cardillo now runs the entire agency

68
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
In charge of all that new in

69
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
The national geospatial-intelligence agency

70
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,376
Any last looking back at his time in that windowless building in that damn room

71
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Because it's problem now

72
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
Is too much

73
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
So many photographs

74
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
So many pixels.

75
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,336
How many people

76
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,432
Like you like your old job how many people would you need to go through the kind of data we're getting

77
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
So we would have to hire eight million

78
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Image Rihanna

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
To accommodate such

80
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,088
Of course they're not going to hire

81
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
Ignoring people

82
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,696
In fact right now the US government training computers

83
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
To do those jobs in the future

84
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,072
Which highlights this issue that the entire satellite business is thinking about right now

85
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
How do we handle this

86
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:21,984
Flood pictures and data coming in from space and those the world even need anymore

87
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,104
Maybe we should follow this before let it but he decided to go to space

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,408

This is a big question for everyone

99
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
What should the Planet Money satellite do

100
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,839

About 12 inches long with foot

119
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,151
It's basically a little telescope with a camera

120
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
And when it is up

121
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,967
300 miles above the Earth

122
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,783

What we have forgotten

149
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
Is that a satellite is just

150
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
It is just a simple tool

151
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
To collect

152
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
And transmit some sort of data

153
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,855
Lot of people get caught up in the technology

154
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,927
And forget that somehow that technology has to be paid

155
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
And so there has to be a business case

156
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
There has to be a client who need some data

157
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,191
But you know what no one wants to work in no one wants to work at a data cap

158
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727

163
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639

164

Into orbit

165
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,503
And yet they do not have a strong plan for how they're going to make money off

166
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
Like us

167
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Yeah I know

168
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
The challenges that too many

169
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,207
Plans going on this too much being built this a lot of

170
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,999
Venture funds around bed

171
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,815
I've been poured into a lot of these companies and

172
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
And they going to be sad

173
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:06,239
And I'm hoping that I'm wrong of obviously in this regard bed

174
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
As there is a bubble

175
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,335
Do you think

176
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
I have considered

177
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
Possible that we need

178
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
Podcast and the satellite into space

179
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
That is when you know there

180
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,343
That has occurred to me

181
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Fart

182
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,415
This existential crisis

183
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
This is Eve

184
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
Exactly what the entire industry

185
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,839
Is facing right now everyone's asking the same question we are which is

186
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,887
Did the world really need another satellite

187
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,679
What can we do with the satellite

188
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
It will change the world

189
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
I mean

190
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Such a production

191
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,031
To get to space

192
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
We have to do something to make it

193
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Worthwhile we have to

194
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Sanlitun

195
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,455
Party off on some kind of word omission

196
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,783
Yashow first went to figure out what are satellite

197
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
Is able to

198
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
To take it for a test drive ascent

199
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,159
So I arranged a sit-down with Kathryn Scott

200
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
She runs the image analytics team at Planet

201
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
People who let us adopt other satellites

202
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
Bibelot

203
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
200 satellites just like ours

204
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
Audience

205
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
It's already taking pictures every day

206
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
I just wanted to see like

207
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Just today

208
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
Just today what do those satellites

209
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
Today it's almost

210
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
224 terabytes a day comes down it's something on that order of magnitude

211
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
Taking a New York today

212
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,551
Well there about 25 magazine

213
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,367
So it's about yet about 800,000 images

214
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,135
Everyday

215
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,207
800000 fotos de so no one can

216
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,023
Can look through them is not a human being here watching the photos come down

217
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
Everything is automatic

218
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,631
Planet has computers that stitch together all of the photos

219
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Does of the Earth every day

220
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
Okay so you can essentially

221
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,495
Do that thing you always see in spy movies you know

222
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Pick a spot on the Earth

223
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,591
Zoom and enhance exactly

224
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
All that power

225
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
At

226
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Your fingertips

227
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
Annie like I'm such an idiot

228
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,015
The first thing I say when I sit down at this

229
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,087
Incredibly massive opportunity

230
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Is

231
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,159
I would love to see my apartment building in

232
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
I know everyone does at the first

233
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
Show me my home

234
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,607
Area 51 and then maybe if they're really creative you're like I want to see North

235
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
Austria

236
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,655
I nice

237
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,447
So where are you on the Block

238
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
I am

239
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Okay you see that

240
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,359
This this little lump right there is a is a synagogue and we're right

241
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
There

242
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
On the other side diner right on that street

243
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,295
You can see my apartment building my kids school a few trucks

244
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,367
And I realize I'm using this cutting-edge technology

245
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,671
To basically take the world's most

246
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Expensive selfie

247
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
I mean it

248
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
It's not why pretty much everybody does every

249
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Everything now though

250
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
Yeah yeah and you know

251
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
How did they do not

252
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,983
Underestimate the value of a selfie from space

253
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,311
Because she says the Planet Money satellite views not

254
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
Just

255
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Camera

256
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
The time machine right

257
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
It is a

258
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Time machine

259
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
Because our satellite

260
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
Will be taking photos every day

261
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
At the same time

262
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
You can then go back

263
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,463
And see how things change and if you can go back in time and figure out a model you can actually can guess what the future is going to hold to

264
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
Princess would look at my neighborhood in capital says

265
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
Look at this construction site

266
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
U-Box from my apartment

267
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
Delaney Park Place

268
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,703
You can go back in time and figure out how

269
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,471
Quickly

270
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
The construction crews are moving

271
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
Let me see like you can see that

272
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,895
Those used to be buildings they are they took it out

273
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
And

274
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,551
You know I mean if I did some analytics you I could use this data to figure out

275
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
When they will finally

276
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
Stop

277
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Running

278
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,927
All those trucks through my neighborhood everyday

279
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
It's exciting that we finally have the technology to how

280
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
How do you fight your neighborhood battle

281
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,327
I have many of

282
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
We should think bigger

283
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,471
For the Planet Money satellite

284
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
Let's make a little bigger

285
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,847
So Francis planet makes money by selling access to this time

286
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
The CAT scan showing

287
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:01,503
And they should have salad in bulk right for a dollar or two for $2

288
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,319
You can get pictures of one square kilometer

289
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Over the course of a

290
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
NSLC

291
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Subscriptions to this day.

292
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
Farmers agriculture companies

293
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,535
To the US government Robert cardillo the photo analyst

294
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,839
Turn director of an agency we talked to earlier

295
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:20,447
You just made a deal for the US government to pay Planet 14 million dollars

296
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,751
4 photos of high-priority areas

297
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
That would be North Korea

298
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,199
Look the real money is not in taking photos of the

299
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,503
It isn't analyzing the

300
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
In finding the pattern

301
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,855
Patterns that no one else knows about

302
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
So

303
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
We need to think like

304
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,951
Spies Like spies

305
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
And I found

306
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Some

307
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
That we talked to her

308
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:50,399
They work in believe it or not an old converted Dairy Barn in Louisville Kentucky

309
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,447
I visited there with producer Elizabeth

310
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:01,663
Hi there

311
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,735
Alfanar is the chief R&D officer

312
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
Genscape

313
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
The boring way to describe what Jem skate does

314
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Is Market

315
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
IntelliJ

316
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
But really

317
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,999
We have been described as the James Bond of Commodities and energy mark

318
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
Journal no less

319
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,447
Oh that's a pretty good pole quote that's what you want from the Wall Street Journal

320
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
So that was pretty exciting

321
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,823
Different planes in the financial World everyone wants an edge

322
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,127
A little piece of data that no one else has

323
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
Engen ski

324
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,431
Something that day.

325
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
According to public documents for company brings in

326
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
Around a hundred million dollars a year

327
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Our life here

328
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,415
She takes us into a room that I swear it's like that

329
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,207
Scene from every James Bond film

330
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,607
Where he gets his gadgets you know the exploding watch The Deadly pain acute

331
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,143
Antoine Roberts

332
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
Workout some contraption

333
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,799
So let's see some oil Traders somewhere want to know how much gas is flowing through a pipeline

334
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
So they can make a bet on the price of

335
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
That's what holds up a box

336
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
We can eavesdrop

337
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
On Pipeline

338
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
There's a directional microphone

339
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,599
And then there is an omnidirectional microphone that we attach to these

340
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
You can hear the

341
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
They pumps

342
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:20,255
When their on them when they're running

343
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:26,399
Spray high pitched I need a lower voice

344
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,727
If the pipeline goes quiet genscape will send out an alert

345
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
With customers

346
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
Pepsiman Gadget

347
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,055
It's for people who trade electricity

348
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,103
So energy Traders want to know if

349
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
Power plants

350
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,175
Are running at full capacity in the middle of the night

351
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,479
Get ripples out one of their night

352
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
Vision camera

353
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,343
Thermal imaging spy camera

354
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
So cool

355
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
So they look as

356
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
Heat signatures from power plants

357
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,487
That's from refineries from anything

358
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
That is

359
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,279
Pause

360
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,071
And we

361
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,935
Use the signal to indicate whether those refineries are running or not or the power plants are running or not

362
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:02,751
That is awesome can we do something like this

363
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
IPod one

364
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,407
Where Sally think do you set alight so a lot of the things that she showed me you have to get close to the pipeline

365
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
The power plant

366
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,223
In order to get the secret info

367
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,831
What satellites have allowed them to monitor everything everywhere

368
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
We walk into this huge room

369
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,463
And there's all these different Jackson everyone is watching different

370
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
Commodities around the globe

371
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
So shut about what's over there

372
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,071
Oils over there

373
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
Power power electricity

374
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Egg

375
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,263
Corn beans we have a soy

376
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
Being monitoring product

377
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,639
To the people in this room are looking at the pictures from

378
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,943
Planet from satellites exactly like ours

379
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,247
And they're turning them into information

380
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
The people pay money for

381
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
So one research we talked to is

382
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,111
Boeing satellite images

383
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
Oil wells being drilled

384
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
Incel

385
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
Sudan

386
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,279
Another one shows me the Smoke Stacks from a power plant in India

387
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
He can tell exactly like it what

388
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Capacity is running at

389
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,447
And then ask your team to show me their newest secret spy trick

390
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
It's like something out of a movie

391
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,335
Marcus Walter and Brett sundheimer open a window on your computer

392
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
Click click click

393
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,175
I see something that looks like a shipping port

394
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
As seen from space

395
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,759
So what are we looking at here is this an actual place

396
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,575
Yes this is Emma port in China

397
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Dalian

398
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
Click click resuming

399
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
And I see what looks like a bunch of

400
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
White marshmallow

401
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Well tanks

402
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
And you can see

403
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
In this photo

404
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
How much oil is in each tank

405
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,215
Cry now and I want to see that

406
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Where is it

407
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
A few more clicks

408
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
And all the sudden there are Little Numbers

409
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Lady of Rage

410
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,175
The computer is taking satellite images

411
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Look at the Shadows

412
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
On the roof

413
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Of the tank

414
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,855
Oil tanks are floating so they go up and down up and down

415
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
The computer

416
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:58,975
Looks in the shadow calculate the angle of the Sun and can tell you

417
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,303
The height of each route and then as we go through everything up

418
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
David Lopez

419
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
Analyze we can see every tanks

420
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:10,495
So this is 17.5% full of this Bank in China that you've never seen your life

421
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Correct

422
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,055
Faustina through satellite imagery

423
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Of course

424
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Junkie just launched the survey

425
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,199
A daily news feed telling customers how much oil there is

426
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Stored

427
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
In China

428
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:25,343
And even though it's based on planet satellite photos satellite photos like the ones we will take

429
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
It is the analysis of the day

430
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,439
It's the way they

431
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
And use it

432
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,743
And marketing

433
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,047
That is what is making the money

434
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
And the service is going to hit

435
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
Oil companies shipping firms commodity Traders

436
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,959
Can use these numbers to make decisions

437
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
When the oil tanks get low in China

438
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,823
You can literally start to send oilfield ships

439
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
Across the Pacific

440
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Before China even asked

441
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
It seems like a logical end to this

442
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
Is that

443
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Someday

444
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,319
Anytime there is

445
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
An additional well

446
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,415
An additional ship and additional tank

447
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,695
Somewhere in the world

448
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,231
We're all going to know about it

449
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,583
That's right yeah we're all going to note about and we're probably going to know within the day

450
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,911
This is just one supply chain

451
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:14,495
Yeah the same for all Commodities but it's also can be the same for

452
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
How many new homes are being built

453
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,871
How much more traffic is are on the highways

454
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,711
Avocado avocado

455
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
Grown you know exactly

456
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:31,647
How hot is a microbit atomic unit of measurement

457
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
But now they have all these spy technique

458
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
See my mind

459
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,279
It gets me thinking about a possible

460
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
Mission

461
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
For the Planet Money satellite for

462
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Pod1

463
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,167
No I love avocados

464
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,495
Support any avocado mission for pod1 let's do avocado

465
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,055
Stacey Hill New York avocado

466
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,103
Popeyes pricing list

467
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,663
Tell me you'll go by a little store and you'll be like

468
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
I got

469
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,271
There's an avocado for a dollar

470
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,831
But then you come back the next day and they're like $3

471
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
Yes yes all the time

472
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:07,743
Yeah who knows why right I would love some data that would tell me how prices are going to change in the avocado Market

473
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
Before we leave genscape

474
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,815
I give this

475
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,887
Pitch to Deirdre and her colleague josef's palinka

476
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
I have the perfect

477
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Name for a project

478
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,239
The guacamole pipeline

479
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,311
Miniature country needs guacamole for the Super Bowl

480
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,591
Nobody knows

481
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
How many avocados are out there

482
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
I mean maybe somebody knows

483
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
I mean maybe everybody mad

484
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
But we don't know

485
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,343
So we could use her side like to make a bet on the avocados

486
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Supply

487
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
Before the Super

488
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
It sounds insane

489
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,279
And you have to let the folks at genscape because

490
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,423
They listen to this and they treated it like it was the most normal ID in the world probably we can look at a different

491
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,007
Part of the visible spectrum or a different part of the

492
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Of the light spectrum to see

493
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,919
Growth quality the same way they do for corn and other crops in the United States

494
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
Seattle food trucks

495
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Avocado truck

496
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
Count trucks

497
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Cow chips

498
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,415
I don't know if they store avocados in piles or put them on pallets or put them in buckets but we could count those as well yeah

499
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,463
You're just suggest that maybe there's some sort of

500
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,839
Avocado bottleneck somewhere we can monitor her like limes and tomatoes

501
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
I don't know

502
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
Really I mean

503
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:20,959
It sounds like you're choking but there is a name for this

504
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
Tracking

505
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
Complimentary

506
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Commodity

507
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,079
It's actually one of the techniques that use against

508
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,407
You're with you something that you know maybe the Corn Chip people

509
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
Know something

510
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
That we doubt about avocado

511
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:37,087
Let me get this straight for a second we're going to use this cutting-edge technology just like intergalactic

512
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,159
Whatever unprecedented moment

513
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
In space technology

514
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,999

518
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
Kid is one of the missions we are looking in

519
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
What are some other options in case you know

520
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,919
We want to use our satellite for

521
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
It'll good

522
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:10,367
Guacamole evolves researchers who need help collecting some data for farmers

523
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
Africa

524
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159
The worthy project

525
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,463
We're going to know more about this once

526
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,767
We can get the satellite into the sky

527
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,047
And sending back

528
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
Real pictures

529
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
When is that going to happen

530
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
That is an excellent

531
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Question

532
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
Because as we've been chasing the mission

533
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
There is this other big problem

534
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,055
Did we have not yet song

535
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Which is

536
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359

People often think annuities are too conservative

548
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,591
Too complex or only for retirees

549
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
But annuity

550
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,919

Can I tell you about

578
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,888
The shooting star guy we met

579
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
So where at

580
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,448
The small satellite conference

581
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,008
And we're asking around like what is the

582
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,568
The weirdest way that anyone is making money

583
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
Off of satellite

584
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
And they said oh

585
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
You got to go talk to

586
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
Josh

587
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
Rodent bomb

588
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
This company called a l

589
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,344
We are creating artificial shooting stars

590
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,672
Artificial shooting star shooting stars

591
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
Oh really

592
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:59,328
Could you could you like buy one for your girlfriend or something exactly so shooting stars are just little debris that go through the app

593
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,704
Write the skies plan is he's going to launch a satellite with a bunch of little fake shooting stars

594
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,776
So what we do is we send up a satellite to low earth orbit with

595
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
Several hundred of our shooting star particles

596
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:14,176
When a customer calls they say hey we want we want a meteor shower this night

597
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,784
So maybe I'm I'm I'm Tokyo and I have the Olympics in

598
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,184
20 20 20 20 and I want to end my Opening Ceremonies with shooting stars coming out of sky

599
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
We say okay

600
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,280
And when our satellite passes over we release them

601
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304
They burn

602
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Even in the

603
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,144
Bright bright City you will be able to look up and see the stars

604
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
So

605
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,192
He has not

606
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
What's the satellite or sold any of these things yet

607
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
But he said

608
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
$1000000 will buy you

609
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,920
I think that's a pretty great way to spend a million.

610
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Honestly

611
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
On a meteor shower

612
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
Okay I guess he's going to be rich
