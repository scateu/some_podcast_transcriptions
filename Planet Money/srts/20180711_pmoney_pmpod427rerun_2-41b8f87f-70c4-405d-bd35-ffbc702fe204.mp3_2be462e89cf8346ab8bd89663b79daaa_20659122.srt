The UPS Store

He's doing another thing

11
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
All together

12
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Opening

13
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
The UPS Store

And of course shipping

16
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,320
Last week there was some huge news in the world of professional basketball

17
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,856
LeBron James

18
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,672
Decided to leave his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers

19
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
Again

20
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,488
And this time we'll be joining

21
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
The Los Angeles Laker

22
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,328
She's just signed a deal that is worth

23
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,912
154 million dollars / 4

24
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,728
And it reminded us of an episode we did

25
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,776
Way back in 2013

26
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,640
Back then LeBron James was making 17 and 1/2 million dollars a year

27
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,664
But

28
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
Economist told us

29
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320
LeBron might be the most underpaid athlete

30
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
On the play

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,952
Yes LeBron James almost certainly has been extremely underpaid

32
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
For his entire career

33
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,816
That was Victor Matheson an economist at Holy Cross University

34
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:11,424
Another Economist Kevin Greer put it more bluntly he's getting hosed

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,312
But that was 2013 now LeBron has this brand new deal he's getting a lot more money

36
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,848
And we wanted to know

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
Is he still under pay

38
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,688
And so today

39
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,784
The ammunition you need to get into the nerdiest fight at your local sports

40
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:32,160
We're going to play part of our 2013 episode explaining why Lebron used to be underpaid

41
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
And after that we will run the math again

42
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,000
Quick no sheer

43
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
Some of the players mentioned in this original story are retired now including Mike Miller who's awesome there's no way we're cutting

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
Alex blumberg & Taylor Tepper pick this up

45
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
After the break

46
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,360

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
Taylor bus layout

60
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,664
For how a multi-millionaire like LeBron James

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,432
Getting hosed

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,712
And to do that

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
Let's imagine

64
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,528
A job

65
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
Monster.com or a newspaper

66
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
Wanted

67
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
Once-in-a-generation NBA super

68
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
Skills required

69
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,048
Must be able to soar through the air in order to execute thunderous dunks

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
Check

71
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,776
Be a team player who works well in small groups of five

72
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:57,920
Who can facilitate performance by executing and possible seeming cross-court passes to barely open teammates

73
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:03,552
Check printing

74
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Thrive under pressure

75
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
Preference given to

76
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
2 tall strong

77
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
Extremely agile candidate

78
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,232
Inability to play suffocating lockdown defense

79
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Again Economist Victor Matheson

80
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,288
So by lots and lots of measures LeBron James is the best

81
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
Player in the NBA

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
If you keep

83
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
Playing at the pace that he has for the last 10 years and has a lengthy career that is not interrupted by injury

84
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,320
He may go down as the best player in the history of

85
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,464
All right so say you work at an imaginary human resources department LeBron James resume with

86
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
I got to figure out highlight-reel lands on your desk

87
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,584
And you got to figure out how much do you pay this guy

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
What is he worth

89
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
How do you figure that out

90
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
If only there was a way to determine just

91
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
How much value he adds

92
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
The team

93
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
This job candidate somewhere in his employment history

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
Switch teams

95
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,688
And you able to compare the economic impact of that switch

96
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
If only

97
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
The answer to the question everybody wants to know

98
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
LeBron

99
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,392
What's your decisions to anyone with even a passing interest in sports

100
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
You remember this

101
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,744
LeBron James decided to leave his old team

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
The Cleveland Cavaliers

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,119
And go to his new team the Miami Heat and this phone will take my talents to South Beach

104
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
And join the Miami Heat Miami Heat that was the conclusion you woke up with this

105
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,079
That was the conclusion I woke up with this morning

106
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,407
This decision was actually called the decision was broadcast

107
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
On Primetime around the world

108
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
This was huge

109
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Sports news

110
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
For everyone the Cleveland Cavaliers they felt betrayed

111
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,343
Fan they're burned his jersey

112
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
LeBron James

113
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
Reviled on Sports Talk Radio 4 weeks in months

114
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
Italy whole year 2

115
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,279
But that's not why we're talking about this moment

116
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
We're talking about it

117
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,935
Because it gives us a pretty clear picture of how valuable LeBron James is

118
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
When you left the Cavaliers

119
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
The value of the team

120
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
How much it would have been worth it

121
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:01,567
The teams on her head

122
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Tried to sell it

123
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
Exactly that value drop by about

124
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:05,919
25%

125
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
Any value the team that he went to

126
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
The Miami Heat

127
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
Went up 30%

128
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,575
This is all according to calculations done by Forbes

129
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
When you take all this into account how much to

130
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Ticket sales with drop how much

131
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
TV Revenue would go up

132
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
The people who study this will tell you

133
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,511
LeBron James

134
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
Should be making

135
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
Around 40

136
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Million-dollar

137
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
More than double

138
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,399
The current salary

139
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
And there you have it

140
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,239
The mathematically precise amount by which

141
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
LeBron James is getting hoes

142
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
Is getting hosed

143
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
Out of over 20 million dollars a year

144
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
If that's the case

145
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
Let's say I'm the general manager of

146
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
My beloved Brooklyn Nets

147
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,063
We're not that good we're stuck in the middle of the pack

148
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
I'm sorry

149
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,695
What's the stop me from saying we'll get to your team in a minute and stop me from saying

150
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
Hey LeBron James

151
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,071
I will pay you your full value I'll pay you 40 million dollars a year if you come on over and play

152
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Was you know Alex

153
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
You're not allowed to do that.

154
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
There's a salary cap in the NBA

155
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,799
Is a limit on how much owners can pay their players

156
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
Yeah there's a limit on how much they can

157
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,919
Can pay in salaries overall and there's a limit on how much an owner

158
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
Can pay any individual

159
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,015
Litter is called a maximum contract and you're not

160
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Really loud to go over that

161
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
Without incurring

162
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
Very happy find

163
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,927
So no matter how rich a basketball team owner is

164
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,255
And there are some really rich ones including the Brooklyn Nets owner

165
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,095
They're not really able to pay LeBron James what he's actually worth

166
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
And that's one way LeBron James is getting hose

167
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
The salary cap

168
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
But the salary cap that is just the beginning

169
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
Of the long Saga of halibut

170
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,407
There is another feature of the NBA's rules that is arguably even worse

171
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
LeBron James

172
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
And that is

173
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
The draft

174
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
Not for sports fans

175
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
The draft system

176
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
It's so ingrained it seems

177
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,927
Pretty normal but when you actually described it out loud to people as we've had to

178
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,767
Going to be out of this podcast

179
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,327
Sports and all the sudden seems really bizarre

180
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
When players want to go to the NBA

181
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
They don't do what happen

182
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Any

183
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
Field in the world

184
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
Send their resumes are highlight reels

185
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
Do the teams they want to play for

186
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
And then if it's

187
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
Makes an offer

188
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,479
Negotiate over that offer and then both parties come to a final say

189
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
Where they will

190
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
They're not in the NBA

191
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
It's way

192
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Weirder than that

193
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,927
Cell potential job applicants

194
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
The best young basketball players in the world

195
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Today right right

196
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,095
To those applicants they put their names in this big pool

197
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Hoosier Lottery

198
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
Literally with ping pong balls in those crazy

199
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
Plastic tubes

200
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
And the 14

201
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Worst teams in the league

202
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
I'll have to draw a number

203
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,407
And whoever draws the winning number gets the right to pick first my big pool of talent

204
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,223
And this is the weird part whatever player that

205
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Teen pics

206
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
He can't say no

207
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
You have no choice

208
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
And Emily that

209
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
He can't negotiate his salary

210
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
His players union

211
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,695
Has already negotiated an upper limit

212
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
How much rookies can get paid

213
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
And this is the way it works

214
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,047
Even

215
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
If you are a one

216
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
In a lifetime Talent

217
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,447
Like LeBron James

218
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:14,847
In the 2003 NBA Draft the Cleveland Cavaliers

219
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
LeBron James play the drafted just like soldiers are drafted during a war

220
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
In this case

221
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
Cleveland drafted LeBron James

222
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
You can go work for the Los Angeles Lakers

223
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
The New York Knicks of the Boston Celtics

224
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
No

225
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,511
He was going to go to Cleveland whether you liked it or not

226
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Imagine of other fields were set up

227
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,655
Like what that you're the best young software engineer at MIT

228
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,215
Silicon Valley Inn

229
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Getting hired

230
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,287
Friend insane starting salary by Google

231
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,615
You had to put your name into a pool with other engineers

232
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:54,527
And then the worst companies in America got to draw a random numbers and then one day you would get a letter thing I know you've been hired

233
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
To work in the IT department at Best Buy

234
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
I'll just beat amazingly frustrating

235
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
But this is basically what happened to LeBron James

236
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,999
And everyone knew he was going to be great even in high school

237
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,143
In a free market there would have been a huge bidding war for him with some of the best teams in the league trying to William

238
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
But instead

239
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,751
Wolfel Cleveland Cavaliers happen to win the lottery

240
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,055
They got to select them he had no say

241
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,615
And they were able to pay him far less than it was worth

242
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Cell

243
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
That brings us to an obvious question at this point

244
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
Why is it set up this way why is there a limit on how much teams can spend why is there a draft system

245
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,159
And who would getting all those extra million dollars

246
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
That should be going to LeBron James

247
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,767
Well again here is Victor Matheson from Holy Cross

248
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,095
There is certainly one big winner in the salary caps

249
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
Is the owners himself

250
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:47,775
By reducing the amount that they have to pay for their labor and to provide their product

251
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
They certainly

252
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,103
Generate significantly higher profit

253
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:56,223
And we see sports teams in the United States be far more profitable than sports teams in Europe

254
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
Which Temple don't

255
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
Have salary

256
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
All right

257
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,391
So I guess you can see who I owners would want to arrange things

258
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,719
So that they had to pay their superstars weigh less than the market value

259
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
They want to keep

260
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
Some of that money that they otherwise pay LeBron they want to keep

261
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
That themselves

262
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,935
And in fact it's actually illegal under antitrust laws for owners of other businesses

263
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
Collude about salaries

264
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
The way that owners of NBA teams do

265
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
But the NBA like other sports leagues

266
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
Got it. Exempted from this

267
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
Antitrust laws

268
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,711
But it's not just colluding owners

269
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Are the ones holding the

270
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
His left

271
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,087
Talented teammates are Jose matters money as well

272
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Set remember this salary cap rules

273
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
Thinking about is part of

274
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
The collective bargaining agreement between the owners

275
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
And the NBA players union itself

276
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
Here is our other economy

277
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Kevin Greer

278
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
Welder Union

279
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,959
Is is Union votes on contracts by majority rule

280
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
And so we would think if it's

281
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
Black majority rule that it

282
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Would be

283
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
The guy in the middle

284
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
Who would be the crucial voter

285
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
Right if you could line if you pick

286
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Pékin anything like salary

287
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Open Line everybody up

288
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
Who wants it the most

289
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,783
Cuz he wants it the least

290
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
It would be the guy right in the middle of that day

291
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,367
Players the medium

292
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
The answer is

293
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,231
The media player the non Superstar

294
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,327
They don't want all the money to go to LeBron James either

295
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
For themselves

296
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Do I think about this I think of Mike Miller

297
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
Like one of LeBron James's team

298
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,263
Chances are even a casual fan knows about LeBron James

299
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,591
Probably you've heard of LeBron Superstar teammate Dwyane Wade

300
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,895
The Mike Miller no one outside of a hardcore back

301
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Mike Miller is

302
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,527
He's a good player he's an excellent shooter he plays pretty good defense

303
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
But in a non salary cap world

304
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
He probably wouldn't be making

305
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Nearly six million dollars a year

306
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
What is what is making now

307
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
Can a non filler Cap World

308
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,815
Teams would probably want to pay LeBron James a bit more

309
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
And Mike Miller

310
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
Surpassing even bigger reason

311
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,239
That LeBron James teammates really like this crazy system of the salary cap in the draft

312
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,799
Is it expands the total number of jobs

313
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,383
And here might be instructed to talk about my Washington

314
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Do we have to

315
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
Unfortunately I think we did okay I got it

316
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,807
Cuz it's possible that without this system in place

317
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,623
Almost none of the players on my team

318
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
We even have a job

319
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,743
Dip for the tie from jannero Pargo

320
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:22,143
And it gets no I have no room no no nothing so easy to explain we're watching

321
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,007
A sad highlight from a Washington Wizards game of that sort of the opposite of the LeBron James highlights

322
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,055
Final seconds of the game the score is tied

323
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
The Wizards player jannero Pargo

324
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,663
Take the shot for the wind and

325
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Hemostat

326
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
Hairball

327
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
You did as well as

328
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:44,415
The Wizards are terrible basketball team when you can buy Wizards ticket from a scalper for a dollar maybe even less

329
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
The Wizards

330
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
Existed in the real economy the Buick Studebaker

331
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
Are the Saturday evening post

332
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
Out of business

333
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
But because the Wizards are a team in the NBA

334
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
They don't go

335
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Because

336
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
They can always rise again

337
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,359
If they stay one of the worst teams in the league they are guaranteed a really high drafts

338
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Pek

339
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,967
Which means they got a good shot at maybe getting the next level

340
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
A great player

341
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Who could

342
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,039
Get the money again

343
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
And because of the salary cap system

344
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
You'll be able to keep that player

345
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,463
And keep them from getting poached by a richer team in a bigger Market

346
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
So the draft system in the salary-cap system

347
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
Keeps bad teams from going out of business

348
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
And give him a chance to become competitive

349
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,679
Which means are more jobs

350
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
People like

351
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,055
Martell Webster Martell Webster Martell Webster

352
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,127
Is one of the worst players on my Washington Wizards

353
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
The worst team in Basque

354
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,479
And players like Martell love this

355
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,551
System that hosts LeBron James because without it

356
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
Maybe fewer NBA teams

357
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,391
Which means fewer NBA players

358
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:53,023
Which would almost certainly mean there be no one around to pay 1.6 million dollars a year

359
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Tomorrow

360
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,863
Okay so you got this crazy system that rewards failure in

361
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,471
Encourages collusion by business owners set up essentially a system of conscription

362
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
As a method of recruiting and distributing Talent

363
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,079
It's a system that free market economist

364
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:10,175
Like Kevin Greer the one that we talk to you at the University of Oklahoma

365
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Seem to hate

366
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
Right this wrong

367
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
You know I think it's not a horrible

368
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Horrible overall cyst

369
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
In terms of maximizing

370
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,951
The viability Revenue profitability

371
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
So Kevin Kerr may be an economist

372
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
Please also a basketball fan

373
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,607
A basketball fan in a very small Market

374
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,167
That has benefited enormously from this crazy stuff

375
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,567
An argument is making is that by making the economics of the NBA as anti-competitive as possible

376
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
You make the league

377
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
A competitive

378
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
So even a fan

379
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Like heaven Greer

380
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,503
Who lives in a small Market town like Oklahoma City

381
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,087
Can root for a really great competitive team

382
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
Latinos able to draft

383
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
Great players like Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook

384
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
And pay them far less than that actually works

385
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
And Kevin Greer is not the only one out there

386
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
They're a lot more fans now

387
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,679
And towns all across the country that wouldn't have competitive teams to root for

388
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
If not for this crazy system

389
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,567
And more fans all across the country that's good for the NBA

390
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Again

391
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,175
So generally players unions have agreed to

392
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,199
Restrictions

393
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,295
In order to try to increase competitive balance in the league

394
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,903
Which the players believe is going to increase the overall size of the pie

395
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,791
So again if the average sports fan Nationwide is is kind of like me saying

396
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:34,655
We want every team to have a chance at least every once in awhile to be a contender

397
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
If you think that's the sort of thing that most Sportsman's care about then that's going to generate more revenue for the

398
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,895
We as a whole and so the the players want that

399
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,735
That pie to be as big as possible so when they get their slices

400
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
As much as they can get

401
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,575
And this brings us to the final answer key to our mystery

402
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,159
There is one group who really doesn't seem to get much out of the rain

403
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
LeBron James

404
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
And his Superstar Khali

405
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,535
Why don't he and Kevin Durant

406
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,375
And all the other superstars were getting Hoes by the system why don't they band together

407
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
And go on strike

408
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,775
That would be the most elite labor action in history Thunder imagine right

409
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
Do they have velvet everywhere

410
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,151
But the problem is they kind of benefit from this to

411
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
The league overall is bigger and more popular and generating fans and all these towns that otherwise wouldn't have fans

412
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,343
Then that's great for LeBron

413
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
Because most of his money

414
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,439
Doesn't come from his salary it comes from endorsements

415
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,231
And the bigger the league is

416
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
The bigger his platform is

417
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,303
More money he'll get

418
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
For those endorsements

419
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Again

420
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Thomas Victor

421
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,447
So the NBA is a is a relatively

422
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,263
Minor ich component of his overall compensation

423
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,103
But if you wasn't in the NBA that outside compensation wouldn't wouldn't be there

424
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,687
Or wouldn't be there nearly as much I mean if he was the world's if he was like that

425
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
The three-time Olympic decathlon

426
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,319
Or he would know in no way be making near the mountains

427
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:02,463
LeBron James getting paid his full market value but it's not like it's another option that would pay him

428
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,279
More than he makes out getting Hoes by the NBA

429
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
The NBA create the market

430
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
For his talents

431
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Brighton

432
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,983
LeBron James is a basketball player and is only one National Basketball Association

433
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
It was around before LeBron was drafted

434
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,847
And we'll still be around after you retire

435
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,175
The only thing rarer than LeBron James is basketball Talent

436
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
Is it basketball league

437
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,295
It will only pay him 17.5 million dollars a year

438
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
For that time

439
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
Alright a lot has happened to LeBron James insta

440
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,535
Episode first ran he left Miami to go back to

441
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
The Cleveland

442
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
He has now left

443
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
Cleveland to go to Los Angeles

444
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
And he's making a ton more money now

445
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:48,287
What's 17 and 1/2 million dollar salary has jumped to roughly 36 million dollars

446
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
Is he still getting hosed

447
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Will find out

448
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
After break

449

Okay figure out if LeBron James is still underpaid we called up one of the economist from that original report

459
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,407
Victor Matheson

460
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
From Holy Cross University

461
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,527
He happened to be on vacation at the time in Mexico

462
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,831
I am in Cancun I'm sitting there

463
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Pina colada

464
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,671
A pina colada by the pool under a palm

465
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,743
I could touch a palm tree if I set up

466
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
From my love

467
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,071
Well don't do that don't strain yourself

468
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:43,839
Just Lounge

469
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
And we'll ask you about LeBron James

470
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,935
Is LeBron James

471
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,751
Still under page is salaries gone way up

472
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
Probably still on the page

473
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,847
LeBron continues to get hoes

474
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
Even with a monster deal from the Lakers

475
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:01,247
Because being the world's greatest basketball player means being responsible for

476
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
Huge economic ripple effect

477
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Think of ticket price

478
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Victor

479
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,927
Hope example in Cleveland

480
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
Stop the game

481
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
Prices for the tickets

482
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,535
Way more than that

483
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,327
Delphine some evidence

484
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
Erytop Stars

485
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
Might be making even if the NBA Max

486
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Salary

487
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,775
Still might be underpaid by 2030 50%

488
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,591
That means LeBron James may still be underpaid

489
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
By around 20

490
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Million

491
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
Dollars

492
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,575
Thanks so much

493
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
Sure Thing by

494
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,927
For a second opinion on this we called up Brian wind

495
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
First from ES

496
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,255
PN he's kind of the LeBron James guy

497
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,815
I sometimes and

498
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,631
Guilty of making things too complex so

499
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,471
Please don't be afraid to say hey you're not talking

500
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
2

501
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
NBA Board of Governors are

502
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Luckily Brian says

503
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
This is not complex

504
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
It's wonderful babe

505
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
And

506
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Yes because

507
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,015
By 6 years ago the NBA was bringing in

508
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,367
About seven or eight hundred million dollars per year in television money from there

509
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,927
Broadcast Partners turn on ESPN

510
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
That number is now closed

511
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,511
2.4 billion

512
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:22,911
The TV money has tripled per year Lebron James salary is only a little over double

513
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
And of course a big reason TV money is up

514
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
Is because of LeBron James

515
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
Brian says that

516
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,639
If LeBron salary was not tied up in all those NBA restrict

517
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,455
And if teams were able to pay him whatever they wanted

518
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Migas

519
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,551
Is that a team in a very large Market

520
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,903
Would probably offer LeBron a deal approaching a hundred million dollars

521
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:49,023
Instead LeBron will have to make do with that 36 million-dollar salary

522
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,375
Oh and by the way LeBron is also getting hit by moving to California

523
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,983
A state with the highest income tax and a much higher cost of living than Ohio

524
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
Looks like poor LeBron James just

525
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
Can I catch a break

526
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:08,479
This episode originally ran

527
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,111
I'm back in January of 2013 it was originally reported by Alex blumberg & Taylor Tepper

528
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:20,256
This rerun was produced by Megan Cain or supervising producer is Alex goldmark or editor is Brian Dozier stats

529
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
And LeBron James is better at basketball than Michael Jordan

530
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
I'm Kenny Malone

531
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,120
Thanks for listening
