1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,792
Just a quick note

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,328
There is a curse word in

3
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,096
Today Show

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,680
One thing that I think is genuinely interested

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:11,008
About economic inequality is that it's kind of like a

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:11,776
Puzzle

7
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,824
Does all of these contributing fact

8
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,152
There's history and globalization and

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,176
Technology

10
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
Racism

11
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,272
Sexism all of these ones are there

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,672
But the thing that I hate about covering inequality is that it very quickly turns into a political fight

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,488
Conservatives have one solution liberals have another

14
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,560
Awesome groups don't even think inequality is such a bad thing

15
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,376
And I just want a couple months ago my mind was

16
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,912
Blown when I heard that there would be

17
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,680
These two guys

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:44,544
From very different ends of the political Spectrum who were working on the problem of inequality

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
Together

20
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,848
The first is brincolin

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,200
Vice president and director of the open Society project at the niskanen center

22
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
Center in Washington DC

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
What is anise candy

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,808
It's a libertarian-leaning think tank

25
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,112
I spent a lot of time covering the libertarian

26
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,904
And here's what they'll generally tell you

27
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
Governments to Big there too many regulations

28
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744
We should let the market

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,536
Flourish on its own and that

30
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,864
Takes care of most problems in the world surprise me so much

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,912
The brink is working with this guy

32
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
I describe myself as

33
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,544
Is a liberal that is Steve Tellez he's a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,592
He's also a fellow at the niskanen said

35
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,408
Center and by liberal he means he thinks

36
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,712
Government can play a role in solving problem

37
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,248
So we have a little.

38
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,296
And we have a liberal and together

39
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
You are

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
Liberal.

41
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
Do that together with at 3

42
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,440
Do it together

43
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
Together you are

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,864
Libertarian hello and welcome to Planet Money on new album

45
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,424
That word is not going to take off a Robert Smith

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,728
Travel show two guys from different sides of the

47
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
The political Spectrum ask

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,312
What is causing inequality

49
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
And it come up with an answer

50
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
Did strangely they both agree on

51
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
The economy is rigged

52
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,760
And they think they know how it's being rigged

53
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
And he's working it

54
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928

Gentleman at the same time and since this is Radio we want you to be able

65
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
How to tell them apart

66
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
Okay so Steve

67
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
Steve is the liberal

68
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
With the kind of voice that might be

69
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Appreciated

70
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,928
Steve I think you sound a little bit like Tom

71
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
The 4000

72
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,256
I'm somebody

73
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
We really

74
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,864
Yes good ok good so I was dead on my head

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Now

76
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
II

77
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
The libertarian

78
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,240
Brink you sound like an old timey newscast

79
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,336
4 News

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
You're hired

81
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,456
Beast you guys to Liberal Therrien Smet about a decade ago

82
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,088
Springfield an article for the new Republic about how liberals and Libertarians had more in common than they thought

83
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,928
And Steve had just moved to Washington DC and he was trying to make

84
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
Brinks still remembers the first time they

85
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Steve

86
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,864
Call me up a month or two after that article came out and said hey I think I'm a liberal Therrien

87
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
I have a

88
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
Tennessee be pushy

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,776
And to call people when I read things I like them and I send them notes and say hey that's great

90
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
We should get together we get together

91
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
Alfred coffee

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
The immediate they started hanging out in wash

93
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,480
Can Emily realize that they both saw the world the same way

94
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,272
Stable sort of hopeful

95
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,808
And there was sort of skipped

96
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,856
Optical and they're both obsessed with these

97
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
Two big problems in the US

98
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
Economy

99
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:43,744
The first is how slowly the economic pie

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Is growing slow economic

101
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
And the second is

102
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,608
How the pie is divided

103
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,192
Some people have very big slices some people have little sliver

104
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Inequality

105
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
So bring it to Beaver looking at these two problem

106
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,848
And we should say that neither of them is an economist by training

107
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,200
Steve is a political scientist and Brink is a recovering lawyer

108
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,992
But they say in this case that's

109
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
Surplus

110
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
Economist are

111
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
At least somewhat hamstrung by the fan

112
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
That day

113
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
Hampton start out at least in in

114
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Canterbury economics

115
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,536
With a fairly simplified model of the economy a model of perfect

116
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Competition

117
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
And then they trying to

118
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,911
Explain things as deviations from that

119
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
Simplified model of perf

120
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
The competition

121
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
Perfect

122
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,519
Competition

123
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,335
Where all the firms are fighting on a Level Playing Field to get

124
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
Consumers better

125
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,919
Cheaper products in the most efficient way

126
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
I dream of at night

127
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,295
And industries are constantly innovating and workers are finding new and better jobs

128
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
Moving up the ladder

129
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
Sounds good

130
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,671
But is that how our economy is actually working right now

131
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,487
Now with perfect competition release very good company

132
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
The guy say no

133
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
Yes some people are doing really well in the

134
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,143
A lot of others aren't

135
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
Something is going wrong with comp

136
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
Cricket Steve they have this nerdy French

137
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
Where they talk about all of this all the time

138
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,591
And he started holding on something that

139
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
Liberals and Libertarians

140
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Generally do not agree

141
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
Which is regulation

142
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
Why do we have regulation

143
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:16,415
So you have economic activity and it causes some potential harm to workers or to consumers or to the

144
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:21,791
The environment and therefore you need rules to align that Industries interests with the public

145
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
And so the purpose then of Regulation

146
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,631
Is to do that

147
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
Is to make sure

148
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,311
That the companies in that industry are following the rules in the rules are structured so that the public benefits

149
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
To help consumers

150
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:39,199
The brink and Steve say if you look around the economy there are a lot of place

151
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
This is where regulations

152
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,295
Are helping businesses and industries

153
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
And particular profession

154
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
Not all consumed

155
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
This is the moment

156
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,511
Where we address the great North Carolinian teeth whitening scandal

157
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
Up 2000

158
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
It started

159
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
With the den

160
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,263
Dentistry is a practice that is highly regulated in North Carolina and pretty much everywhere else

161
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,567
If you want to be a dentist you have to have

162
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
Schooling and Eliza

163
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
And you don't

164
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Behind

165
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,807
Licensing dentist all the way these are people who work with drills

166
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
They come at your face

167
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
With the drills

168
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
So make them get lice

169
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
Yeah you want to see something

170
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,487
Framed on the wall before they start to

171
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,815
Give you drugs and take out parts of your mouth that makes sense

172
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,887
But the issue is what you have a corner on the

173
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
Food market

174
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
You have this desire disorder

175
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
Ctrl Alt

176
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Related activity

177
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,103
So when the technology came about dentist started to offer teeth whitening

178
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,383
You know why not

179
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
The thing is

180
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
Teeth whitening is a fairly simple process

181
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
It doesn't require a lot of years of

182
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
School

183
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,599
And people in North Carolina had started opening up these little

184
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
Teeth whitening kiosk

185
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Good malls

186
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Salons

187
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
They charge less than a license dentist

188
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
And

189
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,535
Dentist didn't like that

190
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,583
Competition and so the

191
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,727
Licensing board for dentistry in North Carolina issued cease-and-desist orders to teeth whitening clinics Bellingham

192
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
Stop the unauthorized practice

193
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,079
Dentistry teeth whitening revolutionaries are cute

194
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,127
Winter practicing Dentistry

195
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,455
We take little plastic trays we pour some liquid in there and then

196
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Place them against your

197
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,015
I mean it's more like

198
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Give me a pedicure

199
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
For the

200
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:26,207
Eminem normal free market we can trust consumers to decide if they wanted to go to a mall to get their teeth

201
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
Where to go to the dentist office

202
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
But in this case regulators

203
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
Stepped in and they said no we are making the decision

204
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
For you

205
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,679
You know I picture dentist

206
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
In a castle

207
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
A big banquet table together

208
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
Oxide canisters

209
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Fun

210
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
Tapestries of incisors on the wall

211
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
And outside you have to pee

212
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
Teeth whiteners trying to get in

213
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
But there is a moat

214
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
And the smoke is regulation

215
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
Blocking away

216
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,831
You need a license to come in

217
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
Brink and Steve start

218
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
To see this everywhere

219
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
In so many parts of the economy

220
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,255
Business and Regulation are not at odds

221
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,143
It's not that Regulators are just stepping into stop industry from dumping toxins into the ocean

222
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,471
In what cases industry actually loves regulation

223
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:14,335
Because it's figured out how to make Regulatory Agencies and the government work

224
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
For it

225
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
This is called

226
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Regulatory

227
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,527
Regulatory capture is the process by which narrow industries use

228
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,855
Government in order to entrench themselves in

229
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,439
Notice that Steve said narrow industry

230
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
She's not saying all regulation is bad

231
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,303
But some industry regulation is

232
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
Is being manipulated

233
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
And that's hurting the economy

234
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:41,727
Those teeth whiteners had to close up shop that right there that's job loss

235
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
The dentist

236
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
To shut them down they were doing okay

237
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,103
Now they're doing even better

238
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,431
And it's a small example of how you get growing inequality

239
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:56,575
Brink and Steve decided to write a book together about all of this it's called the captured economy came out a couple months

240
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,135
And it's about regulatory capture

241
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
The theory of regulatory capture was developed largely by an economist named George Stigler in the early 70s

242
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
But this idea goes back along

243
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
In bring conceived book they have this

244
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,447
Quote that I love from Adam Smith

245
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,983
Now that's an Adam Smith

246
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
Play by Tom

247
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,567
People of the same trade seldom meet

248
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
Even for merriment and diversion

249
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
But the conversation ends in a

250
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
Conspiracy against the public

251
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Or in some contrivance

252
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Foods to raise price

253
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:31,647
I don't know why but that quote makes me laugh and I think maybe it's a conspiracy part but Adam Smith was not joke

254
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Was he

255
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,463
You know who else wasn't joking

256
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
The teeth whitener

257
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,071
Years of North Carolina has conspiracy against them

258
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
And the Federal Trade Commission agree with him

259
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
They sued North Carolina Dental

260
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,983
It went all the way to the Supreme Court

261
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
And the outcome

262
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,335
Bright Smiles all around

263
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
This time The Outsiders

264
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
The teeth whiteners one

265
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:57,247
Bringing Steve this is a good example of a son rigging the economy a lid

266
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,367
But in other states the same fight dentist versus teeth whiteners is playing out

267
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,695
And it's also playing out in a lot of Industries I mean you think about it

268
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,255
There are taxi boards taxi regulators

269
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Versus

270
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Uber and Lyft

271
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,631
Optometry Regulators are fighting on behalf of

272
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,447
Optometrists against online eye exam

273
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,007
End hair braiders we did a whole episode about this

274
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,335
Hair braiders are fighting to be able to braid hair

275
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,895
Without State Licensing boards shutting them down

276
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
It seems like wherever there's a

277
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
Profession where someone is put time

278
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
An effort into building their business

279
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
They're also fighting to keep

280
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Keep the doors to the

281
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Profession

282
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
Close Dentistry doctors

283
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
Lawyers

284
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,951
Limit the number of entrance

285
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
Limit the amount of copper

286
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Petition

287
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
That they're going to have which

288
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
I understand

289
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
You already have a business

290
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
You think

291
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:45,887
You're good at it

292
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
Your customers like you

293
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
I want more peep

294
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,751
Yeah the problem is The Regulators

295
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
The referees are not supposed to be taking

296
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Decide

297
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
And when they do take a side sometimes it leads

298
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
Stewby's really warped outcome

299
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
Is there a Hall of Fame

300
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551
Hall of Fame for regulatory capture

301
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
Right up front would be a

302
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Talking

303
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Statue

304
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:07,903
In the shape

305
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Of a giant mouse

306
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,743
Everybody hates me

307
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,791
Yeah we're going to get sued for playing

308
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
We might get sued

309
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
Because of regulatory capture

310
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
So it's semi-serious

311
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
But observers joke that

312
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
Development of copyright law

313
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
The past half-century

314
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,871
We can be explained by making sure that Mickey Mouse never enters

315
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Where's the public domain

316
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,223
I mean copyright law this is not a small thing

317
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
The Story Goes

318
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,551
Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse in 90

319
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:38,111
Teen 28 and under the copyright law of

320
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
But I'm here to copyright on Mickey

321
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
56

322
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,255
That was extended a little bit when copyright law changed in

323
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
In 76

324
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
So then we get to the late 1990

325
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:52,191
And just a couple years before the copyright on Mickey Mouse is about to expire

326
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:55,263
And the Disney Corporation seems to realize what is it

327
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
Steak so the open up an office in washing

328
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
The higher Ubuntu lappe

329
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
I may go to Congress

330
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
And they get copyright law change

331
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
To extend the copyright on

332
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Not to mention Donald Duck

333
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Pluto dog

334
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
This protected Disney's profit

335
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
But not just there to change the law

336
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,023
Allowed all of these other creative Industries

337
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,119
To keep extracting more profits off of their own copyrighted stuff

338
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
So huge

339
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
Record company movie industry

340
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
Fortunes are much larger than they would be

341
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,615
In a senior copyright regime they could hold on to them for a few years

342
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,151
And then they would have to face competition

343
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,247
Competition you know the thing that keeps the economy going and growing

344
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,807
So they're doing a direct line between

345
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:43,135
Mickey Mouse and copyright law and this problem within a koala

346
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,279
Everybody last couple decades

347
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,583
Deceased going to sue you

348
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
Person Wiki

349
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
Steven brinker eigen missing

350
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,775
Mickey and the dentist and lawyers the more they protect their share

351
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
The Less groceries the less Mobility

352
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
I want to learn about regulatory capture

353
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Are you start to

354
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
See it everywhere

355
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,295
Wherever you see a power imbalance in society you could ask yourself

356
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
Who are the dentists

357
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
And who are the teeth white

358
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:20,767
And is there some in French power is there some regulator that is tilting the balance in favor of one

359
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
Bracket Steve talked a lot about an example

360
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
That everyone will know

361
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
And that is housing and rap

362
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
In the book they talk about the Bay Area

363
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Sanford

364
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
1 most expensive places to live in the United

365
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
State we live in New York

366
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
And with my stories

367
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
Horrifying I'm sorry

368
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
Sorry Bae are people

369
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
But like

370
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
It's traffic

371
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
And you know the reasons that are often given

372
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,807
Which is a lot of new

373
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,135
Tech money rents are rising higher and higher landlord's

374
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,999
Can charge more and people don't want housing built in their backyards

375
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Yeah it's the obvious problem is

376
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,351
In a competitive market for housing there's just

377
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,887
Not enough places to live

378
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Casa de practica

379
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,727
Which is such a simple explanation there's just not enough

380
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,287
But look at it from a captured economy point of view

381
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
People who own houses in San Francisco

382
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,943
They're already inside the castle they have got it good

383
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,759
Until when there's a proposal to build new houses

384
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
And you see this

385
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
They go to the zoning board

386
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,135
They go to the regulators and they get the proposal shot down

387
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,231
What do I do

388
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,559
Those big cities that are now the powerhouses of our information

389
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
Economy of pulled up the drawbridges

390
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,911
By making it so expensive for people to

391
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,191
To buy housing there

392
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,263
And so is the result we're having this economic boom

393
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
That is throttled

394
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:41,151
Because ordinary people can't participate because I can't move to those Metro areas and live there

395
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,199
Wait some kid from Dayton can't move

396
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,223
22 Sanford

397
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
Francisco right now some kid from Dayton Camp moved

398
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
To New York

399
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,367
And that means if that kid is stuck in Dayton

400
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,183
Or Cleveland or that's right disclaimer time

401
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,767
I pulled those two cities out of thin air Dayton and Cleveland are

402
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Fine Place

403
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,119
And we also do want to give San Francisco a hard time it

404
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,191
Has its housing issue New York has a lot of those

405
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
Same problem

406
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,055
What we're saying here is that in a country that is sort of built

407
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
On Mobility

408
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Choice

409
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,431
We have set up rules in a lot of the economically dynamic

410
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,247
The keep the nice stuff for the people there

411
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
And make it harder

412
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
For people to come

413
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,135
So what you see this in the economy regulatory capture

414
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
What are you doing

415
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,231
Well the first thing they're arguing is that you just have to

416
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Cenotes

417
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
Sit and notice when your benefit

418
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
When I was talking to bring

419
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,911
I said something very funny they said a lot of the people who read our book

420
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
Will be the people in interest

421
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,495
Mysteries for benefiting from regulatory

422
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
Do you ever go into your dentist

423
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Brink

424
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,383
And kind of like look at him and think

425
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
Mac

426
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,735
Yeah yeah yeah

427
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,903
I don't want to try not to personalize things visit these RC

428
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
Systemic problems and

429
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,511
Dentists work hard they think they work hard and

430
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,351
They do what everybody else is trying to do when the economy is just ultimately

431
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,423
It's ultimately the duty of the governors

432
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,055
To make sure that the rules are in the public interest rather than in the narrow interests of the various clamoring claimants who come before

433
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,127
The funny thing is it Planet Money all we do is personalised

434
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,687
Bookman

435
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,271
I actually do think that it's useful to have

436
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
Some righteous

437
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
Personalized anger

438
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
One of the

439
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Powers

440
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,463
That existing interest have is what political science

441
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
To call policy

442
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,767
The fact that

443
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,815
In general those practitioners

444
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,423
Have a positive image that people think oh dentists there good doctors

445
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,703
They help people write

446
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
Very powerful resource

447
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
Against people who are coming in and saying

448
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,455
Hey you're not acting up in the public interest you're just using this regulation

449
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:57,855
For your own benefit and unless we can actually mobilize some of that unless you can ding some of people's reputation

450
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
It's going to be hard to actually

451
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
Mobilize politically against

452
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
And really that's

453
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Why they wrote

454
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
The book they wrote the book to make

455
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
All of us mad

456
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:12,703
To make us look around in our lives and say wait a minute that's regulatory capture their and they're

457
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,007
And there and knowing it's going on

458
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
Is part of the solution

459
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:21,919
Yeah it's better than looking back in 10 years and say there's another industry that captured its regulators

460
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,967
And now no one can get a foot massage

461
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,063
In fact I was reading the paper the other day that there is this

462
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
Hearing on Capitol Hill this week about banking

463
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:37,279
Thanks for trying to get out from under some of the restrictions put on them after the financial crisis and there was quite a robust debate

464
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,351
Over this but we noticed that the robots debate was mostly

465
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,703
Among the people who showed up who were mostly bankers

466
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,103
And in the end if we've learned anything from Steve and Brink in their book it's that the people who show up

467
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,407
Tend to be the people who with
