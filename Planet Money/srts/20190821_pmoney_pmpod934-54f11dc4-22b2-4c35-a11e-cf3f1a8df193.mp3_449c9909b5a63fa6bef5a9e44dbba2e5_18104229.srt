1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,816
This is kind of money

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,704
Heather Sanders it's Cardiff Garcia

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,824
I'm the co-host of Planet Money Daily Show the indicator along with Stacey Vanek Smith

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,848
And I'm here to help

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,872
Planet Money listen

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:19,712
My name is Louis Sachar I'm 13 and I'm in 7th grade

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,784
I'm wondering about the inverted yield curve

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:27,648
Because it just inverted and I can worry that there could be another recession

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,464
Okay well listen as it happens

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
Leo

11
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,304
Planet money has a spin-off podcast called

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
The indicator

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,096
Have you ever listened to it

14
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,376
I've heard

15
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:40,448
We have actually done a bunch of episodes

16
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,984
About the yield curve

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
Already

18
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,544
So I'm going to make you a deal

19
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:47,360
I'm going to send you episodes of the indicator to list

20
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,200
And then after the show I'm going to give you a call and see what you think

21
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
That's not good

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
Yeah

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,784
This is a great topic

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
To be asking about

25
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:00,416
About right now and actually leaves not the only one a lot of people have been emailing Planet Money

26
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,184
To ask

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,976
What is up with the Joker

28
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,792
It doesn't mean we're about to have a recession

29
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
Now as you hear

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
Michael ho Stacey Vanek Smith can vouch for the fact that I am kind of obsessed

31
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
With the old truck

32
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
I find it fascinating

33
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,008
I find it mysterious

34
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,336
And I'm Amazed by the fact that for the past 6 decking

35
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:23,456
When the yield curve invert it has anticipated every single recession

36
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,600
So today we are putting together our two favorite indicator episodes

37
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
About the

38
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
Dedicate them

39
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
Aaliyah

40
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,512
Hello welcome to Planet Money I'm Carlos Garcia they on the show

41
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
The yield curve

42
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
What it is

43
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
What it means when it inverts

44
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
What it means that it doesn't for

45
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,008
An interview with the guy who discovered the inverted yield curve as a recession predictor

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
And finally

47
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:53,920
Our answer the question of whether you should be scared and nervous and panicking when you see those headlines

48
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
About the yield curve inverted

49
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
You should buy the way

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,256
Greg

51
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
What are you doing here again

52
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,352
I write a newsletter

53
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
Where can people get that sweet sweet content npr.org Planet Money newsletter that's why they can sign up

54
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
That's what I can sign up yet

55
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,760
Right here is the guy who first

56
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
Explain formula

57
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,832
The powers of the yield curve

58
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:37,440
I'm Campbell Harvey I'm a professor of Finance at Duke University

59
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
And in 1986

60
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
I published a thesis

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
The detailed

62
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,656
The predictive ability of the yield curve

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
The forecast

64
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
US economic growth

65
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,288
This was the seminal paper

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
On the topic am I right

67
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
Hat is the first paper

68
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,480
Back in the 1980s when Campbell was working on his thesis

69
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,808
He says that other Scholars were investigating the stock market

70
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
Get to see if it could help predict for the economy

71
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:06,880
I was going

72
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
Campbell was not convey

73
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,280
So the idea that equities should have information about the

74
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
The future path of economic growth

75
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,632
Because equities discount

76
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
Future earnings from companies

77
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,800
So it kind of makes sense but when you actually look at the equities

78
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
They were delivering a lot of false signal

79
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
Also the market drop

80
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,736
Hobbit there is no recession so I was thinking

81
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:33,760
Well

82
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,368
What if you looked at something less risky something less volatile

83
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
And it was logical to look at

84
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208
I'm the bond market

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,488
Specifically

86
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
Campbell started looking at the US Government Bond

87
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:51,936
The yield curve shows the different interest rates that are paid by each of the different US Government Bond

88
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
Treasuries

89
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,776
Treasuries have different expiration date

90
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
Soap for example there is

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
3 month treasury bill

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
A 2-year Treasury

93
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
5 year

94
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
10 year and so on that is just

95
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
When you cash them out after that

96
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Time

97
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,112
And you curve just shows you the different interest rates on those different Treasury

98
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
The basic idea behind Campbell Harvey

99
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Restasis was simple

100
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,256
When the economy is expected to grow

101
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
Do you curve slope up

102
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
In other words

103
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,143
As you go from short-term treasuries to long-term treasuries

104
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,959
The interest rate should be getting higher and higher

105
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
So the interest rate on a 10-year Treasury

106
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
Should be higher than the interest rate

107
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
5 year treasury

108
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
And that should be higher than the inter

109
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
Straight on a 3-month

110
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,479
And the reason this happens is it if the economy's expected

111
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Did you grow

112
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:42,111
The long-term treasuries have to pay higher interest rates in order to attract buyers

113
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
Otherwise Byers

114
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
Just invest in the economy itself

115
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
Like I can invest in a company

116
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Ebony ore in the stock market

117
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
When longer-term interest rates fall below shorts

118
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
Interest rates

119
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,655
We say that the yield curve has inverted

120
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
What is sloping

121
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,447
Down

122
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
And an inverted yield curve

123
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
What is a forecast in an economic recession

124
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
Is on the way Legend

125
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Legend

126
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,383
Canvas pieces

127
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
Look at all the time since the

128
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
Steve's that the yield curve invert

129
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,575
More specifically he looked at all the times that a longer-term in

130
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:16,671
Interest rate had fallen below a short-term interest rate for at least a full quarter

131
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
Soap for at least 3 months

132
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,791
And what he found was it every single time the yield curve inverted

133
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
A recession follow

134
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,423
Every single recession has been preceded by an inverted yield

135
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
There were no false

136
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,287
What chemical is his thesis was greeted with

137
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
A bit of Suspicion

138
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
By his fellow

139
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,919
To be frank I some members of my committee

140
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,455
We're pretty skeptical

141
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:41,503
Really not enough observation

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
And so you got

143
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,367
Only a handful of recessions how do we know this isn't just lucky

144
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,463
Campbell's reasoning here the idea that the treasury market was more useful

145
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
For predicting economic growth

146
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
In the stock market

147
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
It would immediately get a useful test

148
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
Is it October 1987

149
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
Famous day known as Black Monday

150
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
The stock market started

151
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Crashing

152
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,079
A lot of people thought this big fall in the stock market meant the recession was on the way

153
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
In 1988

154
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,895
Not Campbell

155
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
I was

156
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
The lone voice

157
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Saying no

158
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
There's not going to be a recession 1988

159
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
My model suggests that economic growth will be

160
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
4.1%

161
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,999
And I was way out there and not inverted

162
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,047
Did the time

163
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,863
Not inverted in 1987

164
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,423
The economic growth that was released 1988

165
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,959
4.2%

166
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
So it was remarkably accurate

167
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,567
And basically not doing a false signal

168
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
And ever since

169
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,919
Every time the yield curve has inverted for a quarter

170
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
A recession is follow

171
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
Usually within about a year

172
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,319
A lot of people have been wondering if the yield curve is no longer

173
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
Requires used

174
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Used to be

175
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
When I say a lot of people

176
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,255
I'm including one Stacey Vanek Smith

177
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,839
But I'm not alone there is there is

178
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,631
Definitely room for healthy and selection

179
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Skepticism about the

180
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:08,543
Absolutely you are definitely not alone and I'm thinking here is this the Federal Reserve

181
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
The US Central Bank

182
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
Has been a huge fire Treasury

183
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
For roughly the last decade

184
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,479
This was all part of the fed's attempt to stimulate the economy

185
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
After the big Financial

186
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,063
So essentially the government has been getting

187
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,487
Treasuries at maybe the yield curve has been distorted by all that by

188
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,279
Is a maybe the signals are sent

189
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
And are not as helpful as they used to be

190
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,911
This idea of distortion of the yield curve

191
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
Is not a new idea

192
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
High indeed

193
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,567
The Distortion the yield curve was lot easier

194
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:47,455
In the 1960's and 1970's when the Government Bond Market was a lot smaller

195
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,295
Fruit the same people that I actually look at

196
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,599
Different plenty of intervention

197
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,415
So this is just the norm

198
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,231
And try to make the case that

199
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,583
It's somehow different today than it has been in the past

200
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
I don't think holds a lot of water

201
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:12,031
Doesn't hold a lot of water when I consider the source here Cardiff course he loves the yield curve

202
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
It's great and he's been proven right ever since you did

203
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
Ever since yes but Campbell does say that using the yield curve to predict a recession is just part of

204
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,575
A model he also expresses some help

205
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Skepticism

206
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:29,951
And he also said that all models you can stop being useful if the world changes

207
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
In some Panama

208
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,559
And he says it's Sunday that could happen to his model to

209
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,887
Yeah now yield curve

210
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
Things that you know

211
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
Got to have a little bit of skepticism about the

212
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
A little Caution never killed anyone

213
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
Or maybe it's actually

214
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
We're going to take a quick break

215
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,455
And after we're can answer the question of what's been happening with the old

216
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,479
Curve

217
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Right now

218
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271

From NPR

234
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:42,143
Okay so we put together this next episode of the indicator in July of the

235
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,935
Because back in March

236
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,751
Something happened that we have been saying could happen

237
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
Ever since we launched the indicator

238
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
The yield curve inverted

239
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
And since March it has stayed in

240
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,015
Kim Harvey's flashing warning sign the full quarter of this upside down world

241
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
Has in fact

242
00:09:59,295 --> 00:09:59,807
Happened

243
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,087
The next episode

244
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
One that we sent to a listener Leo

245
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
Addresses some of the questions you had about the yield curve

246
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
The Shield

247
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
Try to contain your excitement

248
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
So when we say the yield curve

249
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
What we mean is that the long-term interest rate

250
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
It's paid by US government bonds

251
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Treasuries

252
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
Are lower than the interest rates paid by short-term USD

253
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Government bonds

254
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:28,735
And for the past six decades whenever that has happened whenever the yield curve is inverted it has been assigned that the country

255
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
You go into a recession

256
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,039
Is it about a year

257
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
Now if you're a new listener

258
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,903
You might not know that I'm totally fascinated

259
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:41,791
Jason Mathias Aspen dated okay early be wrong

260
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:46,143
Not because it is a perfect all the time

261
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
And not because it's a perfect predictor of a recession

262
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
There is no such

263
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
But just because the yield curve has such a great

264
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
Track record as a recession

265
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Forecast

266
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,479
And also because there were interesting questions and even doubt

267
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
About whether that's

268
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
Streak of perfect recession forecasting

269
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
He's going to continue

270
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
Would you say that the yield curve is practically

271
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,255
In every way I would not say that I have been careful not to say that

272
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,583
But you know a lot of listeners have emailed us

273
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
Specifically you Cardiff with a bunch of questions about the

274
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Because you are so fast

275
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Buy it

276
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
Anthony on the indicator from Planet Money

277
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
We are going to answer

278
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,103
I'm Stacey Vanek Smith

279
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
You're sassy van

280
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Smith is what you are

281
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,759
And I'm Carlos Garcia

282
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,391
Those questions are listen to senses were all really smart but in some cases those questions were also asked

283
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,743
Switch just as much SASS and sarcasm is Stacy's giving me right now

284
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,047
I know there

285
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
Set a channel that Spirit of inquisitive sarcasm

286
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
We are going to paraphrase our listeners questions

287
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,007
And have them read aloud by producer dharius Rafi on

288
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,055
Protest has a phenomenal sarcastic

289
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
That's true

290
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,175
Jeez, don't cry about it

291
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Sarcastic

292
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,711
Victorious

293
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
What is your first question

294
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,903
Correct me if I'm wrong but the yield curve inverted way back in March so is there a reason you waited till now to do a show about

295
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,231
Okay FairPoint question

296
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,303
Here's the thing the first scholar to discover the link

297
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
Between the inversion

298
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Inn of the hills Kerrville

299
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
And recessions

300
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,399
Is named Campbell Harvey

301
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
Duke universe

302
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
According to his research

303
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
In the past

304
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:31,103
The recession forecast has been triggered only when the yield curve has been inverted for a full

305
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
Quarter

306
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
And specifically a

307
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Calendar quarter

308
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
Which means the same quarters of the year that we follow

309
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
For other economic

310
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,831
So the first quarter is the first three months of the year

311
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
The second quarter the next 3 months and sofa

312
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,463
So we had to wait for the yield curve to invert for a full cord

313
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
That happened on June 30th

314
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
That was a couple of

315
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,887
Go and I guess Cardiff you just procrastinated until now

316
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,215
Just make sure the collecting those questions baby oh yeah

317
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,543
So the yield curve has been inverted throughout the whole second quarter

318
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
And a couple

319
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
What weeks specifically the 3-month treasury has been paint

320
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
A higher interest rate than the five years

321
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,527
Oh-so some Economist like ensconced in his Ivory Tower just

322
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,879
Show the calendar quarter like out of his hat in that like kind of arbitrary

323
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
Finance scholar

324
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,719
But yeah this is the next one point that sarcastic

325
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,767
Hiking Cardiff to respond

326
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
Yeah it is kind of arbitrary

327
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:25,119
But the reason to wait for the yield curve to be inverted

328
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
For 3 months

329
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,471
Is the it field trip only inverts for a few hours or

330
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
A few days that does not signal

331
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
A recession is

332
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
Diversion has the last

333
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
Again we are following Campbell Harvey's research

334
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,943
He chose three months of inversion

335
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
To study the We are following that is

336
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,783
So you are now saying that there is

337
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,623
Definitely going to be a recession in the next year I can call you on this right there's a recession coming

338
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,999
Wow okay well this is this got real really fast okay maybe not

339
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
Actually so here is something that you might not know

340
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:59,935
Up from the time you'll / first inverse it is taken an average of slightly more than 12 months

341
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
The recession to actually

342
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Begin

343
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
That was the average for the last 7%

344
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,871
Procession of the really big one that ended a decade ago

345
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,687
Do you curve actually first inverted 23 months early

346
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
Almost two years earlier

347
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,855
This time it could be sooner could be longer or maybe it will not happen at all

348
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,927
But the point is the recession usually doesn't start right away

349
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
So you're saying you

350
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,559
You can't identify a relationship between the yield curve in a recession

351
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
Isn't it possible that your

352
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,679
Magical recession predictor is actually just a series of coincidence

353
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Again

354
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Yes

355
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
I don't like your attitude but you've got a good point

356
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,359
It's definitely possible that it's all just

357
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
The big coincidence

358
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Remember the idea here is not

359
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
The yield curve

360
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
What causes a recession

361
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,783
The theory is that the yield curve

362
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
Flexwood investor

363
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
Fish from around the world

364
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
Think about the US economy the investor to

365
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
To buy us treasuries

366
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,231
And the same ones who probably helped fake the moon landing

367
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
Christmas Cafe

368
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Anyway

369
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,423
Okay so us treasuries are the safest financial asset

370
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,263
They are what you buy if you think the economy is not going to do

371
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
You just want to

372
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
Safe place

373
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,151
Keep your money because you know the US government is good for the inter

374
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Payments that it promises

375
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,735
But when everyone wants to buy treasuries

376
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
Is the same time

377
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,831
In the government doesn't need to offer High interest rate on Treasury

378
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
People to buy them

379
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
So does long-term rates

380
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,159
Go down

381
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,183
And here's the important

382
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,279
The reason that long term rates can fall even below short-term rates

383
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:34,399
Is it investors are rushing to lock in the long-term rates that are available right this moment

384
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,495
Is if they waited in the economy got worse the rates would be even lower

385
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
But that is just a

386
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,639
And just because it's held true for the past six decades and 7 recession

387
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
Does not mean that it can't be untrue in

388
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,551
Someday you'll permite invert and we might not see a recession for years that could happen

389
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,647
Okay so now you're saying the yield curve might be wrong but you're not even going to tell me

390
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Why it might be wrong

391
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Yes

392
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,535
That's right the show's over thank you

393
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
Just take our word for it

394
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
That's all you need

395
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,727
It's okay. Is there a few possible reasons why the inverted yield curve might not actually be

396
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Be signaling a receipt

397
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
This time I

398
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,359
So first of all the Federal Reserve the country Central Bank

399
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,663
Funny turn of long-term treasuries

400
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
As part of its attempt

401
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,015
To stimulate the economy after the great financial crisis the Great Recession

402
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:25,343
So that could actually be distorting the shape of the yield curve right now

403
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,903
Because the FED represents an additional buyer of treasuries

404
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
It'd be throwing off the system

405
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
Another possibility is simply the

406
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:35,583
Policymakers are aware that an inverted yield curve has predicted the last seven

407
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
Sessions

408
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,143
They might change how they managed

409
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Economy Inn

410
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Response

411
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:42,239
Example some members of the Federal Reserve

412
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Which manages in

413
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
Straits heavy even brought up the

414
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,383
The yield curve inversion as a reason to at least be worried about where the

415
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Economy is headed

416
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,967
Policymakers are more responsive

417
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
To the signal being sent by the

418
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
Yield curve

419
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,087
They might avoid the recession by stimulating the

420
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
The economy more

421
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Yes

422
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
The yield curve signal for a recession

423
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
Could turn out to be wrong

424
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,815
Could be the exception that proves the rule sarcastic dharius

425
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Sassy Stacey

426
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,399
Forever point

427
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:15,775
Part of what makes the yield curve so fascinating is that very mystery right we've called the yield curve

428
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,335
Kind of crowdsourced crystal ball for the US

429
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,103
Economy

430
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,407
And it has an astonishing track record

431
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,015
But that doesn't make it infallible you should still be watching other indicators

432
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
For that

433
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
I've got a pot

434
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
Waupaca

435
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
The indicator

436
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
What is a blank

437
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Could you end it

438
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
Solid plug

439
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Shame

440
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
It's true that is a little Shameless

441
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
I kind of like it

And I'm Cardiff Garcia this is NPR thanks for listening

455
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,567
I called up our listener Leo afterwards and asked him what he thought of these Epic

456
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
Yeah I find them really fascinating

457
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
Why

458
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,759
I like how you like talked about both sides on how it might not be realistic

459
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,063
And how do you feel about the economy now having

460
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,367
I heard these episodes about the oak tree

461
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,671
Unless you're that actually predicts

462
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
The recession

463
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Yeah it might not

464
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
You're not as worried about the economy now

465
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Yeah

466
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,471
Not as worried still a little bit one

467
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
Yeah
