NPR Podcast

3
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,840
The following message come from that UPS

4
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,888
Offering services from shredding

5
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,168
To printing to mailbox

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,472
And instead of closing this Memorial Day we

7
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,264
May 24th and 25th

8
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
The UPS Store

9
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,568
He's doing another thing

10
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
All together

11
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Opening

12
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
The UPS Store

13
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,176
Everything for small business

14
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,712
And of course shipping

15
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,808
You would have a hard time finding a country that has been

16
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
Lucky

17
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,368
Over the last several decades

18
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,416
In the Middle East State of Qatar

19
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,280
Qatar Qatar everyone we talked to for the story

20
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
Said it was

21
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
A little bit differently

22
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,352
And we might

23
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,680
Do so throughout the episode what we know for certain

24
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,984
Qatar is it is a country the size of

25
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
Connecticut

26
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,056
It's like a little thumb shaped peninsula

27
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,848
Shares a border with Saudi Arabia

28
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,968
But 2.2 million people live there and almost 90% of them are foreign workers

29
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,576
Curacao oil and gas per capita is the richest country in the world

30
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,136
And for such a tiny place it has this

31
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Outside status there's a big US Air Force Base there it's going to host the World Cup in a few years

32
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
By many measures Qatar is living

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
The dream

34
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
Or at least it was

35
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
Until last week

36
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
Last week Qatar staber Saudi Arabia

37
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
Said it was going to

38
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,776
Close the border

39
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
That's Cutters only

40
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
Order

41
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
They told it to Terry's you can't use our airspace you can't move ships to our territorial Waters and other Gulf Nations joined

42
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,040
It was a modern-day blockade

43
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
And all of a sudden

44
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,160
Tiny cutter which doesn't grow its own food imports everything

45
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
Car was on its own

46
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
People panic

47
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,024
Noor Barakat lives in Doha the capital

48
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
To the doctor there

49
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,376
And she says when she went to the grocery store that day it was

50
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
Bedlam

51
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,728
Cars were parked on the sidewalk there was a sea of people inside

52
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
It has to be hundreds

53
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,872
People are standing in very long lines to the point where it even if you want to

54
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,224
Get to an aisle you can because they're people standing there waiting in line and dial

55
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,296
I definitely started thinking should I be scared

56
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,416
Because so much of Cutters food comes from Saudi Arabia nobody was sure if there would be food tomorrow

57
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
People with really just like

58
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,816
Grabbing everything like even thinks the people probably wouldn't normally Buy

59
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,424
Electric sample there was this one lady who clearly grabbed everything on The Daily Show

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,800
Cuz she had every single type of yogurt flavored non-flavored low-fat.

61
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
Just it was crazy was like

62
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
Was that the food going to war you know

63
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,736
North said she had to stand in the checkout line for 2 hours

64
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,064
The funny thing is the time where we're supposed to

65
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,392
Break our fast the daily fast for the holy month of Ramadan

66
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
We were still standing in line and people just started opening food in the supermarket and just giving out food to each other

67
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,632
North says somebody open some dates and those around

68
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Some yogurt

69
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
That around

70
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
Which country is

71
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Take for granted

72
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,312
In this world if your money will buy everything they could possibly need

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
So what went so wrong in Qatar so

74
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,408
Quickly

75
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
How does a country

76
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
Go from being on the top of the world

77
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
Becoming a pariah

78
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,552
Seemingly overnight

79
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
Hello

And welcome to Planet Money I'm Kenny Malone and I'm Robert Smith for power and money

81
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
On a collision course with his neighbor

82
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,728
It's story of buried treasure kidnapping

83
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
And a glowing Saudi Arabian

84
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,592
Don't forget the falcon

85
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
The Falcons

86
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:32,992

There are two parts

95
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
To the story of the Qatar blockade

96
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,064
There is a spectacularly strange events of the last 3 weeks

97
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
And then there was the even stranger stuff

98
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:11,904
They came before that

99
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
We're both

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
But we're going to start

101
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Back in time

102
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
In a swimming pool in the Middle East

103
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
With an American dude

104
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,375
Our swimming pool where I used to go swimming after work

105
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,655
Was

106
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
Artificially chilled

107
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,727
Never heard of that before

108
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,799
So right so this is normal in the Gulf because it's so hot

109
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
Jim Crane is at Rice University

110
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
An expert on Qatar

111
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,991
Back a decade ago GIF with living in the region floating in his refrigerated Waters

112
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:42,111
And everything was cool but for Jim and for Qatar and for the neighbors they were like

113
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,951
A family they refer to each other as brothers the brother monarchy

114
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,511
The oldest brother in the biggest is Saudi

115
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
Arabia Saudi set

116
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
The rules dominate everything in the region

117
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
The most oil

118
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,703
Most money and the younger brothers are these at Kuwait

119
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
Bahrain

120
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
The United Arab Emirates

121
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
Oman

122
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
And little

123
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,847
Cutter with a lake

124
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,687
Saudi Arabia was discovering oil 80 years ago Qatar

125
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,271
Was a rickety port on the Persian Gulf the economy was built

126
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
On diving for pearls

127
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,903
Pro Bass economy is fine but what they really wanted was oil

128
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
Lots of oil

129
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Phantom wheel but they wanted

130
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,791
Saudi Arabia levels of oil

131
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
So they kept Drilling and drilling for it

132
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,143
In 1971 the shell come

133
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
Is drilling off the

134
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
The coast in car

135
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
In the Persian Gulf

136
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,799
And it starts to get signs that it is sitting on top of a

137
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,103
Oh yeah something big

138
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
But they drill

139
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,663
And they drill

140
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
No oil

141
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
No oil

142
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,991
Just a bunch

143
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Of natural gas

144
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:48,415
That's a huge disappointment so you know mean gas is you know it's got too much lower energy density than oil

145
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
And you know it's hard to store it

146
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
Hell yeah it's hard to ship it out in in barrels

147
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,559
Or balloons

148
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,703
Right so you basically have to have a pipeline from the the Wellhead all the way to the burner tip

149
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
Bottom line

150
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,287
You can't put natural gas on a big ship

151
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
And take it to the United States or Japan

152
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
At least you couldn't Act

153
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,431
And so cutter with stuck going door-to-door to it

154
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
Brother stay saying hey you know

155
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Natural gas week

156
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Build your pipeline

157
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,087
And they were like fine

158
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
We will take your stupid gas

159
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
We're not going to pay you very much

160
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,999
4 years Carter didn't know what to do with all of

161
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Just natural

162
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
The country was rich in something

163
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,839
He could barely sell

164
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,655
They were eventually saved by a nice beautiful

165
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
Any form of a technological breakthrough

166
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
Liquefied Natural Gas

167
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,847
Apparently if you build a big enough

168
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,407
Plant you can take all of that Natural Gas

169
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,687
Make it super cold

170
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Liquify

171
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,783
And put it on a ship take it wherever you want

172
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,855
Qatar essentially built the world's largest

173
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
Air condition

174
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
Engine crane went to see

175
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
Apparently every

176
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
You it looks like the most

177
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,607
Complicated bewilderingly complex massive bull of chrome spaghetti

178
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
Little flares here and there

179
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
Like spaghetti flambeed

180
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
When this liquefied Natural Gas

181
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Plant open

182
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
It is a huge

183
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Suddenly

184
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
You can do whatever it

185
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,735
You think about it this way Saudi Arabia Bahrain all the other Oil States

186
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
Basically stuck

187
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,319
Together they were the family business of

188
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Crude oil

189
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,463
Their fortunes were tied together rising and falling with OPEC in the price of crude oil

190
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
But little brother cutter

191
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,607
Quickly became the largest exporter of natural gas in the world

192
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
And in the last 10 years that was a

193
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
A pretty sweet place to

194
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
To be

195
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
All around the globe countries

196
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
We're converting their electrical plants

197
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
The factories from

198
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
Coal and oil

199
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Natural Gas

200
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
Within a generation

201
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
Cutter isn't just

202
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Rich

203
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,223
It is stupid

204
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,063
And what of course does a little brother do with his Newfound wealth

205
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,623
What any little brother would do

206
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
Qatar rubs it in the face

207
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
Of its older brother

208
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,487
Who decides it is going to

209
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Spend its money B

210
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Becoming

211
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
A big shot

212
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,423
No longer just a nubbin on the backside of Saudi Arabia know Qatar is going to

213
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
They look around at another big

214
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,263
Lots of international

215
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
Influence

216
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,103
I miss you a lot of them have big international news channel

217
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
CNN

218
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
BBC Russia has RT

219
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Toecutter

220
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,223
Start their own

221
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:26,879
Al Jazeera Al Jazeera on the very first program live

222
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,511
In the heart of the Middle East with a brother monarchies Al Jazeera

223
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Was almost immediately

224
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
An annoyance because suddenly

225
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
You have a neighbor

226
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
With a News Network

227
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,191
Snooping through your trash digging up your dirt

228
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Reporting on your scandal

229
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,031
MSY probably came to a head during the

230
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
The Arab Spring

231
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,871
Which you may remember there were all these sort of

232
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Grassroots

233
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
People's movements in

234
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
Tunisia and Libya

235
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735
Egypt

236
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,039
And I'll just a really made its name

237
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,111
Being there on the ground with the revolutionaries

238
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
Between them in

239
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,415
Glorifying

240
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,767
And when your Saudi Arabia or another monarchy sitting and watching this

241
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
This is not good for you

242
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
You are worried

243
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
You may be next

244
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775
You're here is there one of their Brethren with this news channel that's kind of egging on the revolution you know so there you know of course there were

245
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
They're pretty upset about it

246
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
Was just getting started

247
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,479
For so many years their foreign policy had been essentially what their other brother States

248
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
They went along with the crowd

249
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,807
But now they decided to

250
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
Forge

251
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
Their own way in the world

252
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
And they had this

253
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
Radical concept

254
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
For a foreign policy in the Middle East

255
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
Qatar was going to be friends

256
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
With every

257
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Car starts trying to broker

258
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,423
Peace deals they're willing to talk to Israel

259
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Anthem author

260
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,007
Supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and they become

261
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
I'm friendly

262
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
With Aaron

263
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,335
For Colored this makes total sense

264
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:56,479
The ranchers the rights to that big natural gas field they are the country right across the Persian Gulf from them

265
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
And baby shared economic interest

266
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
Saudi Arabia this is a knife

267
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
Saudi Arabia hates Iran

268
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
Feeling is mutual

269
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,951
There's the religious Rift but also

270
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Saudi Arabia and Iran

271
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Are the two big dogs in the

272
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
Barking at each other over everything

273
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,119
A tiger doesn't seem

274
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,959
Hear their every move seems to say we do not need our family any

275
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,031
Anymore we have money we have Prestige we have power

276
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
We have a TV network

277
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
Confrontation was coming

278
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
And everyone

279
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
And then in just the last few months

280
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Three things happened

281
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:33,087
3 orderly Bazar things that seem to have triggered the blockade we are seeing today against

282
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
The orb

283
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
The hack

284
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
And the falcon

285
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
The orb the hackathon

286
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,279
Orbach and Falcons

287
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
You're back in the Falcon

288
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Number one

289
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
We are about to play for you some

290
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,007
And it is going to sound like we added music

291
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,359
Music to this I swear this is actually the music playing during this moment

292
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,455
You would almost certainly seen a picture of this or moment

293
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
Our President Donald Trump

294
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,575
Is visiting Saudi Arabia shiny new Global Center

295
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,367
For combating extremist ideology

296
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
Tunog urate this new play

297
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
The president post

298
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
With the King of Saudi Arabia

299
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,023
The president of Egypt and

300
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,423
A giant glowing orb they laid their hands on

301
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,751
Or everybody applauded the glowing orb

302
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
And with that

303
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:30,175
The GCC dcca I was up and running

304
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
This really was a big moment

305
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
This event was all about

306
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
A giant Command Center

307
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
It looks like it

308
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
NASA

309
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
But it's about fighting terrorists

310
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,439
It's a sign that Saudi Arabia is taking terrorism

311
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Seriously

312
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
It's spending big

313
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
To fight it

314
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,303
The orbit self

315
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,839
Was not signaling trouble

316
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,423
It was the fact that Trump with his very first overseas trip

317
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
Is President chose to visit

318
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Saudi

319
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
I kind of

320
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,335
New sheriff in town move as if to say uno

321
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,663
Baby does old presidents didn't take sides over here

322
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,735
Donald Trump and standing with the Saudi

323
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Not

324
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,807
Event number 2

325
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,087
HAC

326
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
3 days after the orb

327
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,231
By the way that is how we are measuring time to heal after the orb

328
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,327
A very strange article showed up on the website for Cutters national news

329
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
This mysterious article

330
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
Claims that the Emir of Qatar

331
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
Give a speech

332
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:25,215
Incendiary

333
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Trump won't last

334
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031
President

335
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Israel

336
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
Great friend

337
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Qatar

338
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Ron

339
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Fake

340
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,295
Fake news did not happen the news website had been hacked in the story with plant

341
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
Because the story spread around the region

342
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Which brings us to event

343
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,695
Number three

344
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Falcon

345
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,535
This is the most complicated one

346
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
Because it involves kidnapping and ransoms

347
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Falcons

348
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
Have a good night we're going to lean heavily on the financial

349
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Some of the most amazing

350
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,823
According to that reporting this story start

351
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
In December of 2000

352
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Atari hunting

353
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Party was in Iraq

354
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,967
It was about two dozen

355
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
They were

356
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,135
Falconers meaning they travel with Falcons they train the Falcons to take the Falcons hunting and I assume

357
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
Stand around and drink tea while the Falcons

358
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
Fly around

359
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
The party of falconers

360
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Kidnapped

361
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,839
Buying Iranian backed militia

362
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,119
And then held for rent

363
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
And in that band

364
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
The falconers

365
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
Remembers of the

366
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Qatari Royal

367
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
Important people so there was a big issue

368
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,639
Matter kabani lives in Qatar he's with the Brookings institution in

369
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
In Doha would it be like Prince William being kidnapped in England

370
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
No I don't think

371
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Not quite that high

372
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,879
But anyway cuz I chose to deal with the situation you know to negotiation negotiation

373
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
A lot of countries

374
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Canecutters position

375
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Would say

376
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
No

377
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,535
You are a terrorist group there's no chance we're going to negotiate

378
00:13:54,815 --> 00:14:00,959
But it was the royal family and this was cutter who has made it their business to work with all kinds of unsavory group

379
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,751
Did you have a lot of money there

380
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,567
According to the financial times Qatar paid up to 1

381
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
Billion dollars

382
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:15,039
According to Financial Times reporting some of that money may have made its way to an al-qaeda-affiliated some may have gone to it

383
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
Ronnie and security of

384
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,159
Do you know the Saudis in the Rockies try their best to kind of

385
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
Push The Narrative of

386
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:26,815
Customer support of terrorism and this kind of felt

387
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
The Peloton that narrative

388
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,655
Write and in the eyes of Saudi Arabia

389
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,959
It was a problem a big problem

390
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,311
California terrorism funding Iran a billion dollars

391
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
Qatar admitted to the financial times

392
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
Yes there was some money paid but it claimed it

393
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Much as people thought

394
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,271
I'm going to support terrorist groups

395
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
It didn't matter

396
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
The blockade

397
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:52,927
Amazon on Monday Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates

398
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Order

399
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:56,255
Nationals to leave the country

400
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,351
Here's where we are today two weeks into it

401
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,679
Saudi Arabia Bahrain the United Arab Emirates

402
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Give him all severed ties

403
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
They won't allow Qatari planes

404
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
The fly over there

405
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,591
Airspace they won't allow Kotori ships

406
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
2doc although some marketing

407
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
Saudi Arabia has shut down the local out

408
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:15,967
What is your office

409
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
Close the border the only land border that

410
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,367
Dodger hats in Saudi Arabia's asking Qatari citizens

411
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
To leave the country

412
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
What you mean people have to leave behind

413
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Jobs

414
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
Family members

415
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
Apartments for staff

416
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,351
This is usually the moment when

417
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
Powerful country with

418
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
Interest in the region would try to step in

419
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,799
You know what country like the United States in the United States

420
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:45,151
Has military bases in both of these countries in Saudi Arabia

421
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
Anthem color

422
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
But it's been a little tricky to tell

423
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Exactly where the US stand

424
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
What's the message has been

425
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
BestMark

426
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,135
Yeah the president tweeted his support at first

427
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
For the blockade

428
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
He said

429
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,487
Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end

430
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
To the horror of

431
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Terrorism

432
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
But then his own Secretary of State

433
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
Goes on TV

434
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
And he's at the Block

435
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
Is bad it is hurting

436
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,983
People are separating families and it hurts the US Military

437
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
And just to make everything

438
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,079
Slightly more confusing

439
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,895
Just this week as we're reporting this story

440
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,175
United States announced

441
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,271
That it plans to sell 12 billion dollars worth of fighter jets

442
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
To cut

443
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
It is as if they took

444
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
The glowing orb

445
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,463
Shook it looked down into it and it said

446
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Reply hazy

447
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Try again later

448
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
It's all very confusing at the MoMA

449
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
The one thing that we can say with some sort

450
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
We talked to a lot of people on the ground

451
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
In Qatar

452
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,007
Sounds like the supermarket situation

453
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Has gotten much better

454
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,127
Paradise found some new sources of food are now getting yogurt and milk

455
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
From Turkey

456
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
Vegetables from

457
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
Iran

458
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
From Iran

459
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,759
The blockade

460
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,831
Was partially about Qatar being close to a run

461
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
And it may have made cutter

462
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Even closer to a run

463
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,255

480
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231

00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
I'm telling everybody

487
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,551
What it is is it it's common enough

488
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,903
It's sort of like you you wouldn't look twice at at you and like someone walking a puppy for example

489
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,719
But it is mostly for the Super Bowl

490
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
So

491
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:46,143
Say like that it's like having a puppy but like a really expensive purebred hunting puppy

492
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
Have you have you done it personally have you have you gone Falcon Hyundai might have not been a personally I've gone to the f****** soup

493
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:03,039
Put this thing over your arm and was it as fun as having a puppy

494
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,087
