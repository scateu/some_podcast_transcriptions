00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
Earlier this summer

13
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,528
Margaret this day our walked into a room full of cameras

14
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,808
And microphones and Report

15
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,344
Thank you very much

16
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,880
Took a sip of water

17
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,744
Today the commission has decided

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,328
And answer the question that some people have been asking for a long time

19
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,656
Is Google abusing its power over the

20
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:42,752
Google which is now technically part of a company called Alpha

21
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
That is one of the biggest corporations on the planet that controls the information that billions of people see when they

22
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,224
I want to know who was FDR Secretary of State

23
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,016
Cordell Hull

24
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,296
Where is the nearest gas

25
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,856
Apparently it's at 51st Street and 11th Ave

26
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,160
Or where to order a Sony digital camera

27
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
Best Buy.

28
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,256
The European commission spent the last

29
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,072
7 years looking specifically at that last kind of saw

30
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,352
@ed shopping

31
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
And asking

32
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,656
Did Google abuse

33
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
Power over the inter

34
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
Europe's answer

35
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496
Yes

36
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,568
Today the commission has decided

37
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,616
To find Google

38
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
2 points

39
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
Billion euros

40
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,016
For breaching EU antitrust

41
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040
Bruce

42
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,112
Best AR by the way is Europe's competition chief

43
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
And 2.4 billion euros

44
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,232
2.7 billion dollars at the time of the announcement

45
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
Is the biggest

46
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,352
Antitrust fine against a single company in the history of Europe

47
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,400
And as far as we can tell

48
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
In the history of the war

Three on the show the case against Google

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Also the case

53
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,320
How the cases for and against Google help us think about competition

54
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,648
And Market power and the biggest companies on the plane

Premium.

Then offers men's and women's styles for seriously ever

61
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,480
Also you can recycle any brand of jeans in a Madewell store

62
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,528
And they'll give you $20 off and you pay

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,344
They work with the blue jeans go green program

64
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,672
How to turn old jeans into housing insulation for communities in need

00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Terms apply

66
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:42,560
Ready to find your perfect fit stop by a Madewell store or go to Madewell.

67
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
Here is a thing that is happening right now in the

68
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
In all these different parts

69
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,544
To the economy in lots of different countries a smaller number of companies

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,336
Is controlling a larger share of the

71
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:00,480
And there's nothing Economist have been talking about for a while now lately it has started to catch on with politicians

72
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,296
President Trump talk a little about it during the campaign

73
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,368
Too much concentration of power

74
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
In the hands

75
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
Absolution

76
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,512
Chuck Schumer the top Democrat in the Senate just last week

77
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,816
We're going to fight to allow regulators

78
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,120
Break up big companies if they're hurting

79
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Consumers

80
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,704
These are easy Applause line

81
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,776
But figuring out how to apply them

82
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,616
Figuring out what the government should actually do about this is really difficult

83
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,688
And it's Google case is really helpful in singing about this

84
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
It's not just some abstract question. Oh how big should a company be what does it mean it's a specific story with Spurs

85
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
Specific detail

86
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,416
So we're going to tell that story

87
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,768
This giant antitrust case against Google it started with a complaint from one

88
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
Or at least one small come

89
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
My name is Jeff

90
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
I'm the CEO and

91
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
Co-founder

92
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
I found them how do you spell found them

93
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,520
OU infant

94
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Pemf

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
Foxtrot nuts

96
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Mother found them

97
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
Found them like found them

98
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
It was a comparison shopping

99
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
You don't really care about these

100
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Anymore

101
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Kind of the point of

102
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:13,696
The story but back in 2006 when Shavonne rap started found them in the UK

103
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,976
There were a bunch of these sites

104
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,512
Can UK in the US

105
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,047
I used one called bizrate

106
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,607
Back in the day there was another one called Next tag

107
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Here is how they work

108
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,959
Suppose you looking for specific digital camera

109
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,287
And you you guys giving you say

110
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,335
Show me the the cheapest

111
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,383
Sony dx100

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
To be clear she just making up an example

113
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,223
But when Ralph launched

114
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,599
Right there near the top of searches like this or just for you know specific digital camera or whatever

115
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
UNC links

116
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Two found them in

117
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,463
And if you clicked on

118
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Found them

119
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,327
Then you would be taken to a to a page that showed you

120
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Comprehensive

121
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
Action of that much into our offering.

122
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
Taking a camera

123
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
And also

124
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
Price history graph that tells you

125
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,103
How the price that camera has changed over the Lost

126
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:03,871
6 months

127
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
If you could tell if

128
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
Now is a good time to buy or not

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
I figured this was just the beginning for

130
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,367
The technology that made the site work could be applied to almost any kind of shot

131
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
You know shopping for airplane tickets

132
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
Shopping for a sandwich for lunch

133
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:22,815
And she imagined found them growing into you know what giant search engine on its own

134
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
Google itself had a comparison shopping

135
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Insight at the time called

136
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Frugal

137
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,079
Clever name but but it just wasn't good

138
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,663
An internal Google Document from 2006 Edge

139
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Quotes

140
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,479
Froogle simply doesn't work

141
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,039
That quote by the way comes from the UK

142
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,135
The Fountains doing pretty well it's got a couple employees some Angel funding

143
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
And almost all of their traffic

144
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Is coming from

145
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
What's going to happen

146
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Chaffey credit

147
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
On the 26th of June

148
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
I traffic

149
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Post office

150
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
Off a cliff

151
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
Yeah

152
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,239
So we instantaneously the first thing we do is look

153
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
What has happened

154
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
In Google

155
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,615
And what happened is it hola pages

156
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,151
Disappeared from the sex

157
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,479
Where we might be in full sun the 25th of June

158
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,551
By the 26th of June we were

159
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
47

160
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
The guy from 4 to 47

161
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
Essentially switches off

162
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
The traffic

163
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:27,583
The first she thinks maybe the problem is something they did it sound you know some change in the way their Pages were coated or something

164
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
But then she goes on these message

165
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
Boards for people working at small internet

166
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,215
Juicy's

167
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,543
Why do mother companies also fell off the same cliff on the same

168
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
And she realizes

169
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,871
Oh this is something

170
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,151
Change that Google

171
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,967
When you figured out what was going on how did you feel at that

172
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
I am pretty

173
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:59,071
And a coder and a techie at Flix

174
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
I don't do it

175
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Zydu stock

176
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
Reference

177
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Is what sign

178
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,007
Being a red-blooded human obviously

179
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,543
Has its disadvantages

180
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
Giraffe keeps a stiff upper lip

181
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
And she figures

182
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,687
She just some honest

183
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
You know surely will clear it up in a

184
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
But weeks became months

185
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
Became yours

186
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,647
And some of the details of what happened along the way are in this

187
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Butte but a few things are

188
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,487
Yes actually three things are clear

189
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
What's up let's do a list

190
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
1

191
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,911
Found him and other comparison shopping sites remain low in the rankings for years

192
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
Found them eventually sort of semi shuts down

193
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,263
Number two

194
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,847
Google eventually turns its shopping results into app

195
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,711
So today when you see Google shopping results for save a Sony digital camera

196
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,575
You're not necessarily seeing links to you know the most reliable online camera stores

197
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,879
Or to the stores with the lowest prices

198
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
You are seeing

199
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
Paid app

200
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
And number three

201
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,791
More company start complaining about what Google is doing

202
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,631
Siobhan actually goes to work for a while as a consultant for some of these

203
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,471
And government officials in both the US and in Europe

204
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
Start investigating Google

205
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:17,151
The details of the laws in the investigation on each continent or different but the same general principles

206
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,479
You know in both places Regulators are asking this basic

207
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,295
Did Google violate antitrust

208
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
Here's what antitrust law

209
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
It's the law that governs

210
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
Competition

211
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:35,071
It got started a little more than a century ago when these big companies were starting to take over really big parts

212
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
To be economy like

213
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
Oil like railroads

214
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,447
And there's this really interesting tension line

215
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
Right in the middle of antitrust law

216
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Yunnan

217
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
Point of advantage

218
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Is to encourage

219
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
You know we won

220
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Companies competing to make

221
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
Better products

222
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
To provide better service

223
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,783
That is good for for us for for consumers

224
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599
But the Wii competition horses

225
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,671
If somebody comes along and is just better than

226
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
It drives them out of business

227
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
And what's up with the whole Market to itself

228
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Like pink

229
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,327
For example searching

230
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,679
I'm old enough to remember that there were a bunch of search engines out there for years

231
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
Before Google came along

232
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
I'm not going to lie to you

233
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
The only what I remember since Yahoo

234
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,127
Being used with being a finger

235
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
Infoseek

236
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
No Alta Vista Ask Jeeves

237
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,503
Fgxi

238
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
Lycos

239
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:32,671
Wow yeah I was into it so there were all these search engines in like the mid-to-late

240
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
Hourly weather

241
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
And then Google

242
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
They weren't the first or the second or the third of the

243
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,351
But when Google came along they were so

244
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Obviously

245
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
Better

246
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
I like I remember this

247
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
You try Google

248
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,263
It just works ice like magic how does a

249
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Give me the thing that I want right away

250
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:54,431
A10 Google essentially put all these other search engines out of business or made them totally marginal

251
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
Call Google just work

252
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
So much better

253
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,527
So then the question is

254
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
Is this a violation of antitrust

255
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:04,415
I talked about exactly this with a Herbert hovenkamp

256
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
He's an antitrust expert

257
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
At the University of

258
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,071
If a company comes along and it's better than its rivals

259
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
And it puts them out of business

260
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
Because it's better

261
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,959
You're okay under both US law and EU

262
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
You're okay

263
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
You're simply

264
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
A dominant firm

265
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:25,663
I should say by the way hovenkamp consulted for Google about 15 years ago

266
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
Has not worked for them since then and just not

267
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Speaking on their back

268
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,295
Okay so just having issues Market

269
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,623
Cher is not in and of itself a violation of antitrust

270
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,695
But there are people who think maybe it should be

271
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:44,351
Maybe we should worry about firms being this big and this powerful Vera people who argue that Google

272
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,679
And for that matter Facebook should be treated like utility

273
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
You know like say the power

274
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
Highly regulate

275
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,079
But for now anyways that is not how antitrust law work

276
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,663
For now what antitrust law is focused on is called

277
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Consumer welfare

278
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:04,831
He's a big powerful company using its power to charge higher prices or to reduce output

279
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
In the Google cases means

280
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
Are consumers in this case Shoppers you and me

281
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
Are we meaningfully worse off

282
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Because of what Google

283
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
Hogenkamp answer

284
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
No

285
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,399
He says online Shoppers today have it better than ever

286
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:24,799
This does not even involve something as simple as getting in your car and going from one shopping mall to another one

287
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
This is much easier than that

288
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,431
If they're not getting what they want from Google search they can get it from

289
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,783
Yelp or Amazon's not like there's a small group of vaginal pH

290
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,111
The electrical engineers or something you know about this

291
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,439
11 year old kids know about this

292
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:46,815
Any sense of comparison shopping sites were so useful to Consumers then consumers would find them

293
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
Just like they found

294
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,679
Kayak in The Wirecutter and tons of other sites that are not Google

295
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Open campsites treatises US law

296
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,287
He didn't want to weigh in on the specifics

297
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,311
The European

298
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,407
But Google itself has made arguments a lot like these in Europe

299
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,759
Most people who shop online don't just use Google this is what the company says

300
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
They use lots of other sites

301
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
It's like Amazon

302
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
And by the way millions of different merchants

303
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
Compete to sell stuff on Amazon

304
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,743
Competition Google likes to say is just

305
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
A click away

306
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,559
The company also argues that

307
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,375
Consumers use Google shopping Those ads

308
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
The top search sites

309
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,263
Because they're convenient and useful because you click on them and they take you to the thing you want to buy

310
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,103
Google incidentally declined our request to do a recorded interview

311
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
But that essentially is the case

312
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
4

313
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
And for the case against Google

314
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,783
We go now to Gary reback

315
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
Whose job is

316
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,135
Literally making the case against Google

317
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
He's a Silicon Valley lawyer

318
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,231
He's done work for found them and other comparison

319
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
People can shop on other services

320
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
That's true

321
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
So

322
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
Amazon may have lower prices

323
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,751
But Target may have lower prices but Walmart may have lower prices

324
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,055
If you want to spend the time clicking around

325
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
The 12 different sites

326
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
And you know what they are

327
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,199
And they'll be different for Office Products

328
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
Dan for sandwiches

329
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,039
Then you could do that

330
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
These comparison shopping

331
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
Sites

332
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,951
We're intended to do a specific thing

333
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,999
Show you the lowest price

334
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Available on the web

335
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,095
That service is gone

336
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
And as a result Rebecca argues

337
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
Consumers are

338
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:31,775
Margaret vest are in the European commission Wade these arguments

339
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,591
For and against Google they study the evidence

340
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,151
And they concluded what Google has done

341
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Is illegal

342
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
And most importantly

343
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
It has denied European consumers

344
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
The benefits of

345
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Surf competition

346
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,391
Genuine choice and innovation

347
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,279
Earlier this summer win when you heard the announcement when you heard what the outcome was

348
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
What did you think

349
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
We were very very place

350
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
Dispersive unwrapped

351
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:05,823
Hymotion doesn't get any of the 2.4 billion-euro fine

352
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
By the way

353
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
They just goes into the European Commission

354
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
But she does get something

355
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Really important

356
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,015
The European commission's ruling says

357
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
Google has to give

358
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Quote

359
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
Equal treatment

360
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
Two rival comparison shop

361
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
And its own service

362
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,791
Google has to stop Swimming Pool services including its own

363
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
To exactly the same

364
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Standards

365
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
An algorithm

366
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
It is not clear exactly how this is going to work

367
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,287
Google shopping is just fundamentally different than comparison

368
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,055
Shopping sites

369
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,639
Also Google still has an opportunity to appeal this ruling

370
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,223
But this is the change that Ralph has been waiting

371
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,063
So do you think you're going to relaunch found him

372
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Absolutely

373
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,927
We will be able to rebuild our company
