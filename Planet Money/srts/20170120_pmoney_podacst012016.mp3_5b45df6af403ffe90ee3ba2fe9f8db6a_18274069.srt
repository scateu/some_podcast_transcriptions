1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,792
Edward was 28 years old

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,864
He was an academic scholar he just started teaching math at MIT

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:09,216
And on a gray February afternoon a blue Cadillac pulled up outside

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:09,984
Department

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,056
Pretty blonde got out of the passenger side

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,384
Another pretty blonde got out of the driver side

7
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,408
Amanda

8
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,432
White haired

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,224
Kind of short

10
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,296
Elderly man in a long cashmere coat

11
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,112
Got out here and snuggled up between the two blondes

12
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,160
They knocked on the door

13
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,976
The man introduced the young women as his nieces

14
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,792
I was not even I I believe it but my wife

15
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,864
Angrily disagreed is it not nice

16
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,680
And what was this guy's name

17
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,240
His name was Emmanuel Kimmel

18
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,520
Its 1960

19
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,336
Kimmel tells Thor he's a wealthy businessman

20
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,104
And in the parking lot

21
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,128
New York

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,224
He does not tell Thorpe that he used to be in the illegal gambling business

23
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
In New Jersey

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,624
Camels there because Thorpe had just published a math paper claiming that he could do what nobody has ever done before

25
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,696
He could consistently beat the casinos in Vegas

26
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,256
You come up with the system for the card game black

27
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,304
That he said would give the player in it

28
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,864
It was just a theory it was just a map

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,424
But you thought you could work in the real world

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
Lisa Thorpe

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,544
Practice a little bit Let's test it out and then let's get on a plane to Nevada

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
You can use my money

33
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,968
Well he wanted to start with $100,000 for myself you know

34
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,504
Thousand dollars by the way

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,880
Is almost ten times that amount in today's dollars looks like somebody's going to some math kid and being like

36
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,464
Let's go to Vegas with a million dollars and play blackjack with your system

37
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,840
2 months later edsource was sitting at a blackjack table in Reno

38
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,680
With thousands of dollars in chips and a new way of thinking about

39
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,264

43
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:03,392
Blackjack and keep things the way Wall Street thinks about making money

44
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,928

An inter Planet Money

55
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
In the how did you hear about us

56
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,824
Few years before that day the Cadillac pulled up outside his house at Thorpe was living in LA with his new wife

57
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
He just finished his PhD at UCLA

58
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
Enter Professor had told him about these soldiers

59
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Switch spent their time in the army plane black

60
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
They were mathematicians

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,576
And they wind up publishing a paper

62
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
On how to play the game

63
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,440
Thorpe you up a little card like this little chichi

64
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
With instructions based on their cyst

65
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
Any went to Vegas

66
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
To try it out about halfway through

67
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,192
People were ridiculing me that I was playing slowly and the dealer was saying you know I'd

68
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,240
And what form do I come from

69
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,568
The biggest Thorpe is just one more sucker with the new way to lose

70
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
You know people have been coming up with sister

71
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
Forever but no matter what system you use

72
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,712
Including the army guy sister

73
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,016
You were still going to lose in the long run

74
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,320
The odds are still going to be in the houses

75
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,368
In blackjack it's just

76
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
You against the

77
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,440
You add up the value your cards

78
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,256
And the winner is the person who gets closer to 21

79
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
Which by the way is why Blackjack is also

80
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
If you go over 21 you lose automatic

81
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
Even if the dealer also goes over

82
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
Start out with two cards

83
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
You keep asking for more wanted

84
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
The time that you get

85
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,384
Three cars maybe for more than that is really pray

86
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
Tow towards plugging away at the

87
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
Table using this little strategy

88
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
Chichi to tell them how to play

89
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
Annie's getting mocked

90
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
And after

91
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Amanda

92
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
Amazingly the card

93
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,440
Created an unusual situation

94
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,791
In this one hand Thorpe's little Chichi told him to just keep drawing and drawing

95
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,191
It just seemed totally ridiculous but Thorpe didn't think about it he just did what the cheat sheet said

96
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:27,775
Kept asking for more cards with 7 cards

97
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Unheard of

98
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
And they added up to 21 on the nose

99
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
He won

100
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
They were initially ridiculing me

101
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:38,527
And thinking another fool with the system as I looked up my little card

102
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,087
And then when I got to 7 card 21

103
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,879
They seemed

104
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
Cut it off and what was going on

105
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
So I said to myself

106
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,999
What are these people now

107
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
You realize the expiration date

108
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
It's the people who make the rules at the casinos

109
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
Didn't really understand black

110
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,983
He thought if I could just improve the army guys system a little bit

111
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,287
I could tip the math in my favor

112
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,567
I could beat blackjack

113
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,847
So I

114
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
Set out to devise a system

115
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
To do just that beat it

116
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,551
The game has been around for hundreds of years people have been trying to beat it including like

117
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Smart people write who work

118
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,135
You know who knew probability

119
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,695
That's a good point in probability self

120
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
Got started

121
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Because

122
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
Mathematicians

123
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
We're interested

124
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
I'm trying to figure out

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,167
The odds in gambling games in a particular how to beat gambling games

126
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,727
And the result was you can't beat them

127
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,823
Meanings of big they discovered that the house always wins

128
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Exactly right

129
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
What you don't know matter

130
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,111
Going up here against not just the Vegas casinos but that you don't

131
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,439
Hundreds of years of the history of probability Theory

132
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
You go back to UCLA

133
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Go to the library

134
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
To take another look at that part of

135
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
Michael from the Army

136
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,143
I'm standing in the stacks I pulled the article down

137
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,191
I started start reading while I'm standing up

138
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,239
Staring at the article that has this inside

139
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,823
Blackjack is fundamentally different than other gambling game

140
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
Most of the games

141
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
Whatever happens on

142
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
One trial or one play of the game

143
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,759
Doesn't have any influence on what's going to happen next

144
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,855
So if you roll a paradise and get a 5 on one roll

145
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,671
It has no influence on what totals going to come up

146
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
The next role

147
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
The roulette wheel comes up red on one spin or onto spins around 3 spin the odds of whether it's going to come up red

148
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
On the NetSpend do not change

149
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
Blackjack was differ

150
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,495
At the time the dealer dealt from the same deck

151
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
For several hands in a row

152
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,847
Which meant that say if you got an ace in the first hand

153
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
You were in fact

154
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,431
Less likely to get an ace in the next

155
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:48,831
Other systems at the time including the army guy strategy only looked at what was happening in one hand

156
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
It's not just what's in your hand.

157
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,975
It's what happened in the hand before that and the one before that

158
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
As I'm

159
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
Turn down the page

160
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
I realize I'm in order to

161
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,423
The cars were used up during the play of the game

162
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,751
The odds of shift back and forth sometimes for the casino

163
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
Sometimes for me

164
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
Sorbitol estimated to stop

165
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,127
Just looking at the cards in his hand

166
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
And start thinking about the whole deck

167
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,759
Right away he thought of this math techniques you learned in grads

168
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Called measure Theory

169
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,575
That could help him work out that

170
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,903
The idea was pretty straightforward to me

171
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
The hard part was actually

172
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
Doing all the calculating

173
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
It took more than a year to do all the cats

174
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,351
You got that job teaching at MIT

175
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,935
Keep going to the Math building in the middle of the night to work on the calculations

176
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
Started using apartments punchcard ibm

177
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
As the weeks and months went by

178
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
I finally got to the point where I could ask

179
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,895
The Machinist question

180
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
What would happen if I took

181
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
All four aces out of out of the deck

182
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
Sewing machine came back inside well

183
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Hyundai sportback

184
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
Her supplier and I can calculate

185
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,671
From these results

186
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
How much

187
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,535
In other words he now knows that if he's sitting at the table playing Blackjack

188
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
I see is a bunch of pieces go by

189
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
You're out of the deck now

190
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,423
Is odds in the next hand are a lot

191
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
You should bet as little as possible

192
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
Because he is probably going to

193
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
Adderall the other cards

194
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,103
I found out that diff

195
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
If I go out of the deck

196
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
Player gets a huge Edge bigger than

197
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Any other card

198
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,527
He figures out that if a lot of small cars go by

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
And a lot of big cards are still in the deck

200
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,183
The odds are in his favor he is more likely to win than to lose

201
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
Andy calculator

202
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
30 bet small when the odds are against

203
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,815
And big when the odds are in his favor

204
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,631
He will win more than he will lose

205
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Ed Thorp

206
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:43,775
You are the first person to develop a scientific system to beat the casinos at blackjack

207
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
What are you going to do now

208
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,383
I said well I'm going to publish this in a scientific journal

209
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
I want to order another

210
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
But like

211
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
Why

212
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,087
Like why were you more interested in publishing then in making money

213
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
What I thought

214
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,183
Was that I was going to leave the life

215
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Of an academic

216
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
I thought I said

217
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
Teaching in University

218
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
Will be a great life and I would just

219
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
Enjoy doing what I did

220
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,935
And that's pretty much all I cared about

221
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,287
And it does seem like a a step in that direction like

222
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:19,103
You know making you out to be sort of an interesting

223
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:19,871
Math

224
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Researcher scholar

225
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,479
Well I didn't think of it that way I just thought

226
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
Here's something that's going to amaze you guys you haven't

227
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
Doing a magic trick or something right

228
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Exactly

229
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
The proceedings of the National Academy of Science

230
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,207
Published

231
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
It was titled

232
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
A favorable strategy for twenty

233
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,095
It got picked up by newspapers all around the cut

234
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,887
And once again

235
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
People start making fun of

236
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,239
I think he's just one more crank with a C

237
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,055
Casino spokesman said quote

238
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,895
When a lamb goes to the slaughter the lamb might kill the butcher

239
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,687
But we always bet on the porch

240
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,503
Thorpe wanted to prove that his sister was

241
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
That it would really work

242
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,391
So that day when Manny Kimmel drove up in the blue Cadillac and offered to stake Thorpe

243
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
Thorp City

244
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,255
Detox Kimmel down from that original hundred-thousand-dollar off

245
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,559
Just seemed like too much money made

246
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
They wanted to come with $10,000

247
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
Which was still more than Thorpe got paid

248
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
And two months after that first day

249
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,775
Thorpe was ready to fly up to Nevada with

250
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,311
But before we left

251
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,639
Thorpe wife asked him to call everyday just to let her know how things

252
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
And I said

253
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Help

254
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,247
Phone calls are pretty expensive

255
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
Why don't we

256
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
This way we can do without having to spend any money

257
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,159
Here's what I'll do every night tour says I'll call you

258
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
I'll ask to speak to Edward for

259
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
And I'll add a middle initial

260
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
That will be like our secret

261
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
So if my middle initial is a

262
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
That means were

263
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,983
Up 02 $1,000 if it's a b or up

264
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
1002 $2,000

265
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
And so on all through the alphabet

266
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:58,175
Centos wife refuses to accept a collect call

267
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
The way of sending a message for free

268
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,319
And when we hit our teak I think what we're up 13,000 at one point

269
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,159
I asked for Edward M Thorpe at night she sounded very happy

270
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
So just to be clear

271
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
You are up by more than $10,000 you had just made more than $10,000 in a few days of play

272
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Playing Blackjack

273
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
And you didn't want to pay for the long distance

274
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,263
Well you know I grew up in the depression

275
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,055
That mentality sticks

276
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,847
Kimmel is backing

277
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
To keep most of the Wind

278
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:33,247
But for chair was more than $1,000 about 2 months out

279
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
Started to change the way you felt about me

280
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,159
For the first time we didn't have to look at him out for a little while

281
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
Haha that was a that was a pretty nice feeling

282
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
What I thought to myself was well

283
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,583
Las Vegas could be kind of a piggy bank for me

284
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
I need something I can just go out there and get the money

285
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,591
A lot of people feel that way about casinos with differences everybody else is wrong and you are left

286
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
What does go back to

287
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Casinos Within

288
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,455
Does win more money

289
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
And he writes a book called beat the dealer

290
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
The best seller

291
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,087
Becomes like a minor celebrity

292
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Goes on a gameshow

293
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,183
What Laurel Dr Edward Barber

294
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
Please stand up

295
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
Casino start filling up with

296
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,935
You know people who want to be like at Thor people who are trying to count cards

297
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,799
They start changing the rules using mordex shuffling more often to make it harder to count cards

298
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
You know he never said how to

299
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,919
Get rich and casinos are done

300
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,943
With casinos at

301
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
But he thinks himself

302
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
You know I beat the casinos

303
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:43,647
Maybe I can go bigger there is obvious much bigger Casino out there the stock

304
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Maybe I can beat that

305
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
You tried picking stocks

306
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
So I made a few Investments

307
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
And they worked out

308
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Terribly

309
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
Meaning when you say they were terribly

310
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
You lost some money a lot of money

311
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,495
Well I bought one stock at 40

312
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
What are the 20

313
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,919
Suddenly Thorpe is once again just one more sucker doing what everybody else is trying

314
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
In this case

315
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
Figure out which stock is going to go up

316
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
He needs to figure out how to do what he did in Black

317
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
How to zoom out

318
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,415
You know not just do a better job of what everybody else is doing

319
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
Look at the market in a whole new way

320
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
He starts reading about the market in stock option

321
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,559
In particular something called a call

322
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,655
Call option gives you the right to buy a particular stock

323
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
At a set price before some future date

324
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,031
In the late sixties when Thorpe start looking at this

325
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Call options were seen as really risk

326
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
In those days

327
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
It turned out that

328
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,223
People thought of calls as lottery tickets

329
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,783
There's a good chance to call wind up being worthless

330
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,343
And some chance that you can make a ton of money on

331
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,207
Store for Less that the prices people paid for calls were all over the map

332
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
They didn't know how to Value them

333
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:58,655
This is like that moment in the casino where he realized that the people running things didn't really understand what was going on

334
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,311
Again Edwards black Jackie sort of zooms out you know things bigger uses math as a lot of calculations and

335
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
Try to find a net

336
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
I got a really need formula

337
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,455
That's why I like this formula it looks right to me

338
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
I'm going to try it out

339
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
The formula worked

340
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,855
He figured out a way he could trade both call options in the underlying stock

341
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
So that he'd be protected

342
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
If the price of a stock went

343
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
And he started making money

344
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Consistent

345
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
2 years later by the way

346
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:29,375
A couple Economist came up with the same formula and they published it and their work went on to win the Nobel

347
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Anyway

348
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,215
Start managing money for some of his friends in college

349
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
Cassandra start an investment

350
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335
The first one that is really driven by math and Technology

351
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
And the firm has this incredible run

352
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Of using quantitative techniques

353
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,735
Define just one Edge after another

354
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,831
For something like 20 years it is one of the most successful

355
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
Investment firms in the cut

356
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
Like 230 months

357
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
We had

358
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
3 downloads

359
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
All the others were up

360
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,375
I'm through down my thrall less than 1%

361
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,471
So it's like that I feel like that's not supposed to happen

362
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,055
Nobody nobody makes a profit every month for

363
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823

Price

365
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,175
Is it because just smarter than everybody else

366
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,159
I'd hesitate to say that there are lots of smart people in this world why did you do this wildly improbable

367
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
Why could you do

368
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
Well I was lucky

369
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,583

370
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
The blackjack tables

371
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,935
And the blackjack tables are an amazingly good

372
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,215
Training ground

373
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
4

374
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,007

376
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,823
How to think about Investments

377
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
How to manage them

378
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
And the reason is that they teach you

379
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
On the one hand

380
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:47,967
Do use

381
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,527
Probability and statistics to evaluate things

382
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,599
And I'm the other they teach you discipline

383
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,647
When you find something you stick to it

384
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
The Firm was called Princeton Newport partners

385
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,023
The Newport part was for Newport Beach California

386
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
That was where Thorpe ran the firm

387
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Strategy

388
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,191

A lot of the charges were overturned on appeal Thorpe himself was never charged

394
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
Cuz he didn't know what was going on

395
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
But that was the end of the fur

396
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
The Firm shut down

397
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,671

Scrap value more or less

400
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:37,375
During the.com bubble he figured out how to profit in the middle of that craziness

401
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
And all of these

402
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
Deals at all of these markets

403
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775

00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
From the new way that I approach the game

407
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,503
It's the same with all these other approaches

408
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,807
If you if you bring in more information

00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,111

00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
May become beatable

411
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,743
Thorp is 84 years old now he's basically out of the investing

412
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
