She treated him to lunch today

For the past eight years I think I've been paying her phone bill and my phone bill

And a week ago

00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,240

That's not too bad

38
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,224
Cuz I didn't know about the hotels

39
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
The hotels

40
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,088
Chris check into a hotel in Manhattan a couple days ago

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
And all the rooms at this hotel

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Are completely occupied by men

43
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744

48
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
Also how solving homelessness might be

49
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
Surprisingly cheap

50
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176

Tuesdays

73
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,800
People in New York City have what's called a right

74
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
To shelter

75
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,200
That means New York City is legally obligated to find a bed for every person who needs one every

76
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Single adult ever

77
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Family ever

78
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,296
Couple every night of the year

79
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
If the shelters are full

80
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
People cannot be turned away

81
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
So the city rents

82
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,512
Blocks of hotel rooms entire floors entire hotels

83
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
Just for the homeless

84
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,632
Some sort of like a Shelter Hotel hybrid

85
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:23,264
Some are five star hotels with paying customers on some floors and homeless families on others

86
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
Hotel Chris is that doesn't allow him to have any busy

87
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
So I couldn't get in

88
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
I asked for a picture you want to see

89
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
So this is your windows overlooking apart

90
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,856
And that's my bet there and doesn't look

91
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Like

92
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
A hotel bed

93
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
No no

94
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
Like it's not hotel furniture

95
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
Write up here's the headboard

96
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,608
Of what they had I guess I'll

97
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
Queen

98
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
King size

99
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
The headboard is still up there by

100
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Everything else

101
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,056
Taken away so they can put these two cot that what I call him

102
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Yeah they're cut

103
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,384
Twin bed on on metal

104
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
Oh so they removed the

105
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
The official hotel furniture

106
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,552
The hotel that Chris is staying at is a big

107
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,576
Hotel chain

108
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
You've heard of it

109
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,160
You've seen signs from the side of the freeway

110
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
But we're not going to be in the hotel

111
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,768
Because the city told us that in the past when

112
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,047
People have found out that

113
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,863
Certain commercial hotels are housing the homeless

114
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
Those hotels

115
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
Dump the homeless gas

116
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Overnight

117
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,775
Leaving the city scrambling to find new hotel beds for them

118
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,127
All the hotel rooms the city uses are technically shelters

119
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,687
With the rules of a shelter

120
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
You have to be in by 10 p.m.

121
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,039
And you can't be in the hotel during the day

122
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,367
Yeah if you're not working you have to be out

123
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
Between hours of 95

124
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
As far as

125
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,743
Food and drink water and can't bring anything else in

126
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
There are ways you can sneak some candy bars in

127
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
They check your socks

128
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,167
But if you take the candy bar on put in the back of your side

129
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
At this hotel it's two strangers to a room

130
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
That you can get a locker for their stuff

131
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,871
Cuz they're strangers

132
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:08,735
And Chris says his roommate is a big snorer who keeps the room too cold

133
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,319
And his body roommate

134
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
Very close to each other

135
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
Does it feel like a hotel

136
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
Well actually it does

137
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
I'm you do get the

138
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,279
Free Service Tire

139
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
You get the linen

140
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
Veterans what that the inside is is is

141
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
Looks like a hotel

142
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
Last year the city spent 360

143
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,359
4 million dollars about a million dollars a day

144
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
Using hotels as shelters

145
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,455
And of course it spends even more money on

146
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,223
Traditional shelter

147
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
Never said he has to do this

148
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
By court order

149
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,855
Right to shelter has been around since 1979

150
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,951
A group called The Coalition for the Homeless was behind the right to shelter

151
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,583
But even they say that things have turned out kind of weird Giselle routhier with the Coalition says

152
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,631
I never thought it come to

153
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Hotel Beds

154
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,519
It's far cheaper to provide housing and not only is it cheaper it's more Humane thing to

155
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
To do

156
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,871
It just makes logical financial and moral sense

157
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
Housing

158
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,455
It costs about $40,000 a year to

159
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,527
To shelter a single adult like Chris in New York City

160
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:20,671
And Giselle says that is so much more than what it would cost to help Chris rent in apartment

161
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Basically

162
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
Double the cost of renting him in apartment

163
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
As a city

164
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,095
Is now spending a greater and greater share

165
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,143
Sheltering tens of thousands

166
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
The people

167
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
They need to be thinking about

168
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,287
Solutions to start housing people so that they can

169
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,383
Not be spending billions of dollars on shelter costs

170
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
In perpetuity

171
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
Cities all over the country

172
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,271
Spend huge amounts on temporary shelter

173
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,599
Even though housing is often cheaper than shelter

174
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,671
Not always working to get into some of the nuances in a minute

175
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Either way

176
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
Chris says he wants out

177
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
I got to go

178
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,791
I can't stay

179
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,863
And I'll do everything I can to get out of the system

180
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
Christmases

181
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
Cooking in the kitchen

182
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Not matter

183
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,311
Chef Ramsay but I like to cook my own me and my meals are 20 minutes or less

184
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
What do you what do you mix cookie

185
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Spaghetti and tomato sauce

186
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
And the City

187
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,247
They get it they say you have these hotels are expensive

188
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,319
So they're phasing out Commercial Hotel use

189
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
But it'll still take 5 years

190
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,695
And they're investing more in permanent affordable housing

191
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,703
How should the country spend money to address

192
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,823
There was one study in the 1990s that really change the way people

193
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Another next story

194
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
First a little context

195
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,271
Homelessness really comes on the scene as the crisis it is now in the 1970s and 80s

196
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,599
And at the time the President Ronald Reagan.

197
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
The market would solve homelessness

198
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,183
Is that the free market would

199
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
Create low-quality housing for the poorest

200
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
Soap the government shouldn't have to

201
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
Payforit shelters and housing

202
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
So Reagan

203
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
Cut funding

204
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,167
Substantially

205
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
But by the 1990s

206
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
Homelessness is getting worse

207
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,103
And Advocates are pointing out how expensive homelessness itself

208
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Candy

209
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
30 Flyers all over the subway about this

210
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,503
You know the price of a jail cell $58,000

211
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
The price of a hospital bed

212
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,855
$140,000 the price of a shelter

213
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
$30,000

214
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
The price of an apartment

215
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:34,047
$11,000 ghetto professor of social policy at the University of Pennsylvania

216
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
Keystone research on homelessness

217
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,655
And he knows at the time that most

218
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
People experiencing homelessness

219
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,471
AR

220
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
People like Chris

221
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:47,103
People who will need a little bit of help for a little bit of time before they get back on their feet

222
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,943
And that is really just a small group of people who will be homeless

223
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
4 years maybe forever

224
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,295
People with addiction and mental health issues

225
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
Chronically homeless

226
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879
People who are chronically homeless

227
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:02,719
Spend a lot of time bouncing around between shelters

228
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,279
Emergency rooms getting hospitalized

229
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,327
Getting arrested and going to jail

230
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
And that is wanted to find out

231
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
What cost more

232
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,727
Paying rent for the chronically homeless

233
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
Giving them housing assistance

234
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Or

235
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
Keeping things how they are letting them stay home

236
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,687
He follows 10000 people who were chronically homeless over 8 years

237
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
So you wanted to see

238
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,039
How often are homeless

239
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
People

240
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
Using

241
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,415
Shelters going to the ER going to jail

242
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:38,559
If they live on the street compared to if they live in the house that is being paid for by the state of the city

243
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:44,191
That's exactly what we did and when he added up their jail and shelter and hospital stays

244
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
He found that those

245
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
Same dollars

246
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,335
Could have actually solved the problem could have gone toward

247
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
Paying their rent

248
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
And getting them off the

249
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Street

250
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,223
And he found that if you have a house

251
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01,855
You're actually less likely to cycle in and out of jails and hospitals and shelters

252
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,927
So give it all that it was almost a break even

253
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,535
$1,000 more per year to pay rent for this group of people but

254
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,839
Dennis also didn't look at a bunch of other cost

255
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Associated

256
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,655
We did not include

257
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
The cost

258
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
Of

259
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
Emergency medical transport

260
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,055
Which turns out to be a very big number

261
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
And had we included that

262
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,687
We probably would have been better than break even there would have been a positive return on

263
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,527
Denison study has been replicated dozens of times and

264
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,319
Every time I find the same thing

265
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:37,439
It cost about as much to House people who are chronically homeless as it does to

266
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Not

267
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Were you surprised

268
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,815
I will be found surprised that we got so close

269
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
Drake even I am

270
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:50,495
Dennis is dead he looks specifically at a group of people who were considered the least possible and the least

271
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Deserving of help

272
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Single adults

273
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
Sometimes with addictions

274
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,639
And his finding was counterintuitive

275
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,711
That the thing that seems the most generous

276
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Help them get a house

277
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Is basically worth it

278
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Financially

279
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,135
Now it's important to point out that this doesn't necessarily hold for

280
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
People who are not

281
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,183
Chronically homeless

282
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Most people are just

283
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
Homeless

284
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Temporarily

285
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
It doesn't always cost us less

286
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,887
But I think if you look at it over the larger population

287
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
It can be

288
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,519
Break even in many cases and even better than break even and in some cases as well

289
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,103
And Dennis is Teddy really change the tide on homelessness

290
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Best policy

291
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,151
In a huge

292
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Way

293
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
The Sun comes out in mm

294
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
And it convinces the president

295
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
George W bush

296
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,831
To make a goal of ending chronic homeless

297
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Do you what do you remember when that happened

298
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Oh yes I do quite clearly

299
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
It's very exciting I have to say

300
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,583
Bridgeport 500 million dollars into homeless services

301
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
After Ronald Reagan had cut

302
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Almost all of them

303
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
All this extra funding worked

304
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
It brought homelessness down

305
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
To the point where

306
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
Genesis

307
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
An end was kind of insight

308
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:02,175
But in order for cities to get all of his money

309
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
They had to do this weird thing

310
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,575
Which brings us to our final story

311
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Do you have head

312
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,951
Really no idea how many homeless

313
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
People there were on the street

314
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,815
So the Bush Administration told cities and counties

315
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:19,839
Find out

316
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:25,215
Every corner of America that wants to receive federal funding for homeless services

317
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
Has to physically count

318
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
Their homeless population

319
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
Like at night

320
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:37,503
With flashlights and clipboards

321
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,415
On a cold night in January every other year this incredible process

322
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
2 count

323
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
So homeless

324
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
All over the

325
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
Thousands of volunteers bannout

326
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
To physically count

327
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
Every homeless person they see

328
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,703
Call the point in time count

329
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,727
Pet

330
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,799
And every city and county does it a little differently

331
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,919
In Los Angeles it's a visual count more than 8000 volunteers cover every

332
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,735
Inch of the county all 4000 square miles

333
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
7 p.m. to midnight

334
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,087
Shining flashlights behind dumpsters going in

335
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,623
Every alley every

336
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
Public parking lot abandoned buildings

337
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
How's it going

338
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
Countdown across the street every single blue

339
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
Discounted the future is the park

340
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
The dried-out river beds

341
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
Volunteers get a map and a tally sheet

342
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Chance

343
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
They just start Market

344
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
Somebody saying there

345
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
If you see an RV

346
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Tally mark

347
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
Makeshift campsite

348
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Tally mark

349
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
In actual person

350
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
2 individuals

351
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
All these communities

352
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Send their totals to wash

353
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
Where is tabulated

354
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,487
And a quick 11 months later

355
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,583
They get the official number of how many people were experiencing homelessness

356
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
11 month

357
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:02,751
And these tally marks are supposed to help determine where funding and resources will do the most good

358
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,079
Cities do not get more funding for having more homeless

359
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
People that would create a

360
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
A perverse incentive to have more homeless people

361
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,967
It's more about how fast communities get

362
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,039
People out of shelters and into permanent housing things like that

363
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,391
One of the volunteer counters is a guy named Jake McGuire

364
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
Hebert's Addison Austin

365
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,743
I got two hours of training basically

366
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
You know

367
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Here's how to get the tally sheet

368
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
Here's a map of the area you're going to go

369
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
Here's your partner

370
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
Jetta car

371
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
Try to be back by this time

372
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:38,591
Jake is now with a nonprofit called Community Solutions their whole thing is trying to end

373
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Homelessness

374
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
We're like in our lifetime

375
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,431
Before we die like this

376
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Have to happen this

377
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,783
How to be a problem that goes away and these new

378
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Count

379
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,135
Help him realize that the problem wasn't actually that

380
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,999
Big in 2010 at the point in time count showed that there were 106

381
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,303
Thousand chronically homeless people in the US

382
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,631
Remember that's the worst form of homelessness people who are out on the streets

383
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
3 years

384
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:08,799
And Jake and Community Solutions were thinking a hundred thousand people that's actually

385
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,871
A small number relative to other social problems

386
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:16,479
There are more Librarians in the country than there are chronically homeless

387
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:20,319
So they launched a national campaign to

388
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:24,927
Pretty simple find homes for those hundred thousand people who are chronically homeless

389
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
And they chose this number base

390
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
On the point in time count

391
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
The tally marks

392
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
From that night in January

393
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:35,167
You're like okay this is the number this is how many people we have for chronically homeless

394
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,215
Right and then you find out how

395
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
The country arrived at that number

396
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
What do you think

397
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,615
I think okay I guess that's how we do it

398
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
Yeah I never I never questioned

399
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
Yeah

400
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
It took a couple years

401
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
For me to start to wonder

402
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
Is this number

403
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Ridiculous

404
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,743
Because here's what happened to the 100000 homes campaign

405
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,815
All these communities came together and

406
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,119
Found 100000 homes

407
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,423
Actually $105,000

408
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,751
And we sat back and thought this is great

409
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
We just took care of

410
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
You know 90% of problem

411
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
That we're going to see a massive

412
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Decline

413
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Can chronic homelessness

414
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
But that didn't happen

415
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
The next point-in-time count showed

416
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,319
The Chronic homelessness only went down by

417
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
20000

418
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
Not a hundred and five thousand

419
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
To take things

420
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Okay

421
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,535
This point in time count is clearly missing the real

422
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,631
Maybe we can't just count the homeless with flashlight

423
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
Once every other year we need it

424
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,215
Current information

425
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,799
We needed information that was going to be up to date

426
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
In real time

427
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,199
In every community in the country this is how we attract other important things like

428
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
Unemployment and jobs

429
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
We want to know every month

430
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
How is the economy doing

431
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Are we creating new jobs

432
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
Is the unemployment rate going up or down

433
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,231
Because our expectation is that if we start to see that number going in the wrong direction

434
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,303
There are people in the federal government and other places who could do so

435
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,095
Something in response to that information

436
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
If they have it in time

437
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,215
It's so important for those numbers to be meaningful that economist

438
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,311
Go back and revise them months later if they're a little off

439
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,847
Jake thinks the US

440
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,687
Could be tracking homelessness as often as unemployment and jobs

441
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,759
Or like the way we track crime and natural disaster

442
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
Stars in real time

443
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
So we know where to

444
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
Deploy resources to minimize the damage

445
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,183
So they set out to create a database

446
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,999
List of every single person experiencing homeless

447
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
Not a tally

448
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
A name

449
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
Ana survey

450
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
One that's updated at least twice

451
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
Real time

452
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
Homelessness

453
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Data

454
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,519
And big cities with huge homeless population

455
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
It's like New York in LA

456
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
I like

457
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Impossible

458
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,919
You couldn't possibly get that kind of data quality

459
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
In a place this big

460
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
Which I just think it's

461
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,087
Crazy like we track the flu in real time we tried polio around the world in real time

462
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
I mean

463
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
Of course you can get that

464
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,743
Most of the people in LA or extrinsic are known to somebody already

465
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
Like what we just take to get all that data in one place

466
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
End table discount people

467
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
They would talk to them

468
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,167
Ask them exactly what they say

469
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
I mean

470
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,263
Like how do you do that you knock on a tent

471
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
In the middle of the night

472
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Yeah sometimes

473
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
You wake them up

474
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
Yeah yeah

475
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Touch them

476
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
I call out to the

477
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
It's a man a man

478
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,367
Hi I'm sorry to bother you

479
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
If they're sick

480
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
They're veterans

481
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
And you ask

482
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Like

483
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
Are you addicted to drugs

484
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
Very personal questions

485
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
Very personal questions

486
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:51,775
It's it extremely sensitive yeah and they want to know this because a lot of communities have money

487
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,359
That's specifically earmarked to help people struggling with SEPTA

488
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
Since abuse or health problems or

489
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,431
If they're veterans

490
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,223
So if they know this

491
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
They can connect people better say okay

492
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
What do we know about this

493
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,135
What do they need what would it take to get them hell

494
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
What's the plan

495
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Next week

496
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:13,023
Is that person out if not what do they still need okay what's

497
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
The plan did jaundice in 69

498
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Communities

499
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Bergen County New Jersey

500
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
Rockville Illinois

501
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
Chicago

502
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,215
Jacksonville

503
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:27,103
Phoenix and when Phoenix did this they find out that Phoenix had about four hundred homeless better

504
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,639
And that

505
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,735
They actually had all the federal and local housing subsidies they needed

506
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,783
To house all those homeless veteran

507
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
It was just about connecting the person

508
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,367
To the place

509
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:43,999
And this group was actually had more luck ending veteran homelessness than anything else

510
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,303
They worked with nine communities

511
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
To have salt butter and homeless

512
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
End

513
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,191
They got a lot of help from the federal government

514
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,007
The US spends a lot of money on veteran homeless

515
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,847
And for communities in the country have ended

516
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,895
Chronic homelessness overall

517
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:05,247
At least one without the help of this group and 3 with their help

518
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,087
They say these communities are at functional zero

519
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Meaning

520
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
If your home is there

521
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
