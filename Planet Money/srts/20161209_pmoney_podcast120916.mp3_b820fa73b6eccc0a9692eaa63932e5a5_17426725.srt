1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:06,912
So I admit it I am on Facebook a lot way more often than I should be it is kind of embarrassed

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,192
I feel you Alex me too

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,264
But I want to try a little experiment here

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,312
Can I have your

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,080
Password

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
No no way

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,944
I have a lot of Words With Friends games going

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,296
See your fears commentary

9
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
I don't want you to see what I'm doing

10
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,880
Okay so for the sake of the show

11
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Habitus

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,720
What did experiments I will give you my password

13
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,280
Here here is my username and pass

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840
Camera login for you

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
Hey

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
Ivan

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,152
It's exciting thrilling you are seeing the world

18
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
Through my digital eyes

19
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,016
Alex I'm in your account right now

20
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:59,648
Can I go to your private messages can I see who's friend requested you I see these two little buttons over here

21
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,928
Yeah go see that yeah

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,024
There's somebody who you have no friends in common with and I don't think that you should accept

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
Delete requests

24
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
Delete it

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Okay

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,912
So you just locked into my account

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,264
I did with with my permission something I asked you to do

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,616
But according to a recent court decision we might have just committed a federal crime

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,248
Facebook has invested billions of dollars to make a place online

30
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,040
Just the way they wanted

31
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:32,160
All based on how each of us individually clicks and likes and friends and on Friends

32
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,232
Our Facebook account may feel like private property

33
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,560
We're not allowed to give away the keys it is Facebook's house

34
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
Not hours

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
And they say

36
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,632
But we just did

37
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:46,496
Is something like digital trespassing climbing onto their servers without permission

38
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
Which could land someone in jail hello and welcome

39
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,688
The planet money I'm Alex goldmark

40
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,064
When I Murphy shahani today on the show the story of why we may have just committed a crime

41
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
How Facebook protect

42
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,928
And what it means for the future of the internet

43
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,744
It's a story of a man who tried to open up the web

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,816
Who had a great idea that would have made it easier to use

45
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,888
Pretty much every site with a login and how he got

46
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
Frost

47
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:20,032

53
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,568
Our story starts in Silicon Valley in 2006 social networking is the hot new thing

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,224
Facebook is just two years old and it's growing fast there's also linked then there's Myspace or Friendster

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
But you're still a thing

56
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,576
And every single one of them have their own freaking username and password

57
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,392
This is when Steve acciani had his big idea

58
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,976
Steve is one of those Silicon Valley types who was really early to the internet game

59
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,304
He's friends with all of the people that are starting these social networks

60
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144
And he comes up with what he thinks is an even bigger hot or newer idea

61
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
He thinks what if I can fit all of these Networks

62
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Together

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
And make a supernet

64
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,640
And this is actually kind of what it hit me is that rather than create a social network

65
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,432
What am I creative site

66
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,248
That brings all your all your sites together

67
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,552
He was going to make one site to rule them all

68
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
He called it power Ventures

69
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
Answers homework

70
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,208
You put your usernames and passwords from your various social media accounts

71
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,096
All into his sight and from there you could do all your cat picture uploading and liking and hearting and poking from this place

72
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:52,192
It organizes the chaotic early social networking web into one place

73
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
And a lot of people liked it

74
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,080
He said 20 million people signed up he remembers checking on

75
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,664
How fast the company was growing over and over again in those early days

76
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
Remember how it felt

77
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
It's euphoric

78
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
You refresh the page

79
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,832
Every 10 seconds cuz it's you can't believe that you just had

80
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Other

81
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648
Thousand people just entering the last minute

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
It's kind of like pinching yourself to see it's real

83
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:19,327
Only Steve didn't have to pinch himself because he pretty much ended up getting punched in the face

84
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
My Facebook

85
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:25,983
People at Facebook saw that his company was growing fast and caught their attention and it worried them

86
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,799
Didn't like it because it steals their business

87
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,871
Under the terms of service yes we own our data

88
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
But Facebook puts ads next to it to make money so it's really important for them that you're sharing inside face

89
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
When you posed to be a power Ventures

90
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Facebook loses money

91
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
It's even bigger

92
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Then address

93
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,487
Kind of like an existential crisis for a site like Facebook

94
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Because

95
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
Power Ventures makes it easy

96
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,887
For you to use it or just take all of your photos and your post and your messages

97
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:57,727
And move them from Facebook to somewhere else to the next hot new

98
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,519
Social network really easily

99
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,823
So in December of 2008

100
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Just a few days before Christmas

101
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,919
Facebook send Steve an email

102
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,991
It was kind of an awkward email because

103
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
They were treating us like a user

104
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,087
That Facebook stencil I said that

105
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,903
Are violating Facebook's terms and conditions

106
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,183
You need to stop

107
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:23,839
Awkward because power Ventures wasn't the Facebook user they didn't sign Facebook's terms and conditions there were just how

108
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Helping people manage their accounts

109
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
Facebook is protecting its

110
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,703
And it's trying whatever it can

111
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
Remember this is early days on the internet

112
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,775
The rules

113
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
They haven't really been written yet

114
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,871
Answer this fight set the groundwork

115
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,407
Put the paint on the field

116
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,943
Look for so many later case

117
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
So I spent about a month

118
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,343
Just talking to Facebook they would have five six layers on the phone every time

119
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
And they can't work it out

120
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
Facebook

121
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Suicide

122
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
Charge one

123
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,583
Facebook says that logging into their site without their permission is hacking

124
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:56,863
Criminal act

125
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Charge 2 for good measure

126
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
Spanish

127
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,823
Facebook also says that message was sent out on Facebook on behalf of Sears customer saying hey come use power Ventures

128
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
That was deceptive unwanted solicitation

129
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663
Spam

130
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:14,527
If someone calls you a spammer is a connotation that you're from the underworld

131
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,087
It's like being an adulterer in puritan America

132
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,111
That's your Scarlet Letter

133
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,415
Yeah you're not respect you cannot be respected

134
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,463
Mattress not respected

135
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
It's really expensive to be a scammer

136
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
There's a fine for each message

137
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,863
15. Against the fine of

138
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
18 million dollars

139
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
And the first round of battle Facebook one

140
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,775
Steve doesn't have that kind of money

141
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:36,543
And

142
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Because of the lawsuit

143
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Pretty-much can't operate his

144
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
Company and so he shuts

145
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Sit down

146
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,991
It gets so bad that Steve declare personal bankruptcy

147
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,783
But Facebook blocks it

148
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,367
He stays personally liable for that multi million dollar fine

149
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,231
He wants to appeal the case but he's pretty much broke by now when he goes to the big shot lawyer

150
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
To see if someone else will take up the appeal

151
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:02,655
They're all like no this is a case against Facebook and you got to have a lot of cash up front for us to sign on

152
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
For most people

153
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
This is where things would at

154
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
But Steve is not most

155
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:11,359
No Steve his dog and he's like one of those prisoners digging everyday with a cafeteria spoon

156
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,431
And he's got one last idea one last place

157
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
She thinks he might find

158
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,319
There's this website online called Elance where people would post they can do graphic

159
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
Designer build a website for cheap

160
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
And

161
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
Define

162
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Amy summer

163
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:31,071
I have never practiced before I didn't do an internship in a law firm I didn't know the first thing about

164
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,863
Being a lawyer

165
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
She got in her law degree from night school a few years earlier

166
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
The only thing she had ever tried was mock trial

167
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
In law school

168
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,567
Amy was on Elance looking for quick money

169
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,615
Just doing business contracts or something simple

170
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
She's awesome posting

171
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
And it got curious

172
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:52,319
She had no idea that Steve wanted her to appear in front of a judge in federal court

173
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,367
I had to pay

174
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Practice there

175
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
Did he reimburse you for that

176
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
No

177
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
No it did not

178
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,863
Facebook level lawyers usually charge around $1,000 an hour

179
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
Amy was only charging

180
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
$55

181
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
Just the right price

182
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Steve like the price

183
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
And he liked her

184
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,591
I found her to be very

185
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
Humble

186
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,479
That is very naturally intelligent so it's Facebook for

187
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Amy and Steve

188
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,063
I'm one side the best legal team money can buy

189
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
On the other side

190
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,391
I broke CEO who lost his company

191
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,695
Hellokaty Lance my to lawyer on Earth

192
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
First case

193
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
Amy remembers picking out what to wear to

194
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,607
The courts it was the same suit she wore for mock trial back in law school

195
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Curly Sue

196
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
And she remembers in the courthouse

197
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,983
The first time she saw the Facebook lawyers looking like

198
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
Total Pros

199
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
And also very tall

200
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,407
And I'm a little person right and so my very first experience was

201
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,431
15 lb

202
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
It's like towering

203
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
Coming into the team of them

204
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
And I remember just thinking

205
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
Okay don't feel small don't feel small

206
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,743
And she can just tell they're not taking her seriously

207
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
Right from the first handshake with their lead lawyer

208
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
Very weak handshake

209
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,447
But he's shaking the you know woman's hand he felt condescending

210
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
He made this big show of being overly polite to her holding the

211
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:21,663
Store for her that little swinging gate door that separates the judge from the audience he's like not enough for you

212
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
So Amy walks in first

213
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,735
We walk up there and I

214
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,295
Think I picked the right side and I'm not sure

215
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,879
I had no idea where to go I was

216
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,463
Just like okay I'm just going to be no fake it till I make it

217
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,047
The court has already ruled that Steve and his company were guilty of the charges

218
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Spamming a

219
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,399
Facebook lawyers winning ready to try and get the maximum penile

220
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Divide 18 million.

221
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
Amy went to say hey

222
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Lawyer

223
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
Facebook shouldn't get that automatic

224
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,615
We should get our chance to argue it out

225
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
Y'all have to go off at that point is intuition because

226
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,991
Experience

227
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
Don't know what I'm doing

228
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Shouldn't be there

229
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
But actually she's low-balling hearse

230
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
She has more than

231
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
What Amy wants to go read the briefs

232
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:08,255
It struck her that the first judge didn't understand the basic facts

233
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
He didn't get his social networks work

234
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,167
Here with opportunity to explain it correctly

235
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
They can be professional be courteous

236
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,495
And it works

237
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,055
Judge tells her and the tall Facebook legal team

238
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
Any reside with

239
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
View Facebook doesn't automatically

240
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
The Way You Are

241
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
You get to keep arguing about it the case is still alive

242
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,015
The Weeknd tree guy was Furious

243
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,855
He stormed out of the Court not even holding the swinging door open for her

244
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
That's okay

245
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
Amy knows how to open her own door

246
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
And she's starting to feel like a real lawyer

247
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Me up

248
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
It made me feel like

249
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,887
Like there's nothing I can't do

250
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
This means Amy gets her chance to try the case in a bigger

251
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,263
Or Auntie how to plant overturn that spam charged with

252
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
Define any basically points out

253
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,639
The team wasn't spamming he was just inviting users friends

254
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
To join power adventures at their

255
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,015
Stevenson basically what every other site does when your trying to grow

256
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,575
Facebook's entire company was built

257
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,599
Around

258
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:10,463
Users giving their password to Facebook saying go access my contacts on Yahoo and

259
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Google

260
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
And

261
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
Go export all my contacts

262
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,631
And start communicating and send an invitation to all my friends and bring them into Facebook

263
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
The other charge the hacking charge

264
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
With Syria

265
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
It's because it fell under this law

266
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
The Computer Fraud and Abuse

267
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
A federal criminal law

268
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,919
That was about way more than what Steve had done in this one little kid

269
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,759
Now it was about what all of us are allowed to do on the internet

270
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
And because Amy got Steve that appeal

271
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
This case suddenly matters

272
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
A whole lot more people

273
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
The case was headed to the 9th circuit

274
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:48,351
Court's decision here would set precedent for a big chunk of the country is just one step below the Supreme Court

275
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
And it also happens to be broadcast on YouTube

276
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
My name is my name is Steven

277
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
I was at the time of a

278
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
December 2008 I was

279
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Feisty

280
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,479
CEO of power Ventures

281
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
Almost exactly 7 years after that first letter

282
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
Open Facebook

283
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,623
Beef still trying to dig out of prison without plaster

284
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Caterpillar Ventures

285
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
But

286
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:19,583
Things started off well one of the judges liked the idea of Steve's website and even tried to give him a compliment

287
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
Too nervous to hear the

288
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
The phrase

289
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,519
Were you the one who invented this mediasite power.

290
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,287
One of those

291
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
I was a founder

292
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
I was the founder of power.com

293
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
And that's crack

294
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:40,063
Divas fumbling for the right words he's got just a few minutes to lay out the arguments that have been on repeat his brain for the law

295
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
Several years

296
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,903
And then Amy gets a few minutes to make her case

297
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,695
Facebook layers they do their thing

298
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
Aleve

299
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,487
Anyway

300
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
4 months

301
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
Monday and you get an email

302
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
While she's in bed

303
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,911
Left out of

304
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
Covers

305
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
Probably yeah I know I definitely did a dance on the bed

306
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
Steve and Amy

307
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,615
The down-and-out CEO in the Newbie lawyer

308
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,663
They had killed it they got a win

309
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
Bigger than they ever imagined they

310
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,503
Kind of killed it

311
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
The judges

312
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,879
Throughout the spamming charge and with it the multimillion-dollar fine was gone

313
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
Amy's client Steve was off the hook

314
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
But they had really different reactions

315
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
The case

316
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Because the hacking charge

317
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
At one stock

318
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,191
When Steve called out a me to talk about the ruling and it was ready to celebrate their win

319
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
But Steve was like

320
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Whatever

321
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
And I can focus on the real issues

322
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Wait what

323
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:39,455
We be happy about this for you know can we can we just reflect on this last

324
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
4 years

325
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
Doing the impossible

326
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,159
Yes he just won his big fight against Facebook and he was free of the millions of dollars in

327
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,487
But his case had just set back the internet

328
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
And this ruling

329
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Was going to say

330
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
Huge legal precedent that could affect

331
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,119
Every person online

332
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:02,495
The judge said yeah it is a violation of Outlaws the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

333
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,079
If you share your username and password like we did at the top of the show

334
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,871
And Facebook tells you not

335
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
The ruling caught the attention of some heavy

336
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,735
Orin Kerr is a law professor at George Washing

337
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Peking university

338
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,527
He defends her

339
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
And he remembers when you heard the news about the

340
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,647
The decision comes down and I go oh wow

341
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
That

342
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
That is

343
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
Big

344
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
That's really troubling in terms of what it means

345
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,399
Four people using the internet has defended some of the most famous hackers in past cases

346
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
And now

347
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
He is joining Amy's legal team

348
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
Annies representing Steve pro bono

349
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
So if you thought any was making chump change

350
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
Orange doing it for even less

351
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
Free

352
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:44,735
He says that the 9th circuit ruling put way too much power in the hands of internet companies and the government

353
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
They're using a really heavy hammer

354
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
This is a

355
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
Federal Criminal Law

356
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
And they're saying

357
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
Using the account in a way Facebook doesn't like

358
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
That's not just a bad thing that's not you something Facebook disapproves up

359
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
That's a crime

360
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,703
I you should be able to be arrested for that and prosecuted and put in jail for a year

361
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
Or longer

362
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
By the way we check with other lawyers and they agree on that reading

363
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
Facebook didn't want to speak on tape

364
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,407
The story but a spokesperson did tell us

365
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
But letting anyone else login for you

366
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
Is dangerous you shouldn't do it

367
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,343
And if your data is safe inside Facebook but it could be at risk inside of another company

368
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Like power venture

369
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
Spokesperson also said

370
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,511
Facebook gave Steve many chances to settle the case in a way that wouldn't have been paint

371
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
The thing about this case right it's like Facebook

372
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
Wants

373
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
This other startup

374
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
The back off

375
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,727
What can we use to get them to back off

376
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
And they cried this log

377
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
They got a huge wet out of it

378
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
And now they open up this Pandora's Box

379
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
Swear whoops

380
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
Sharing passwords could be a criminal act

381
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,783
And I don't get the sense in talking to Facebook and reading the briefs at Facebook

382
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,367
Why did you do that but they use what they had to do and this is Messi out

383
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,767
Amy and Steve just learned this morning

384
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,583
But the 9th Circuit Court it will not be here there

385
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375

00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
To take it to the Supreme Court

387
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,727
And he's already filed the paperwork so she can appear there

388
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
