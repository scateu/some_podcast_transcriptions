1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,840
A few weeks ago President Trump and republicans in Congress

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,632
Just released a plan to change

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,400
The tax code

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,704
It is now congress's top priority

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,776
They say they'll have a bill on the president's desk by Christmas

6
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,848
Some of the biggest changes in this plan or to the corporate

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
Income tax

8
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:22,016
And this is a big deal the federal government raises more than 300 billion dollars a year from the corporate income tax

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,832
That's enough to cover all the federal spending on

10
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
Education

11
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,440
Public housing building roads Bridges NASA funding scientific research

12
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,464
It's a lot of money

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
Also

14
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,072
Pretty much everyone agrees the corporate taxes outdated

15
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,888
Is it efficient is ridiculously complex

16
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:42,240
We talked with Leslie Robinson a professor at Dartmouth and she made this whole thing

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
Very clear

18
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,568
Even the simplest thing

19
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,104
About the corporate income tax

20
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,384
Not that simple

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
And what do you study

22
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
I study corporate tax

23
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,016
What what is corporate tax

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,416
It's a tax on corporate income

25
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,768
Just to be clear what is corporate income

26
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,192
So that's one of the reasons I said at the beginning

27
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,496
Udo corporate income is just corporate profits

28
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,080
A company's profit its income is what is subject to the

29
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,104
Corporate income tax

30
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
Only it were that simple

31
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
What what is the rate for the corporate income

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
The rate for the corporate income tax 35

33
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Percent

34
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,320
Is that really what they pay

35
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:30,624
No

36
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,440
Oof button

37
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Right

38
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
Leslie says the effective rate that companies actually pay is much lower their different estimates of that but it's probably a little lower

39
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
Over 20

40
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
This Gap

41
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,240
Between the 35% and the 20%

42
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,312
This is the key to the corporate income tax

43
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,616
Cuz you know I'm the one that you hear people say

44
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,688
United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world

45
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
Strictly speaking this is

46
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,040
But at the same time the US tax code has seized

47
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
Deductions

48
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,576
Exemptions

49
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
Credit things that if you don't like them

50
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,440
Sure and what you factor those in the rate

51
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:10,048
Companies actually pay is not the highest in the developed world is sick and normal average rate

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
This is not a great way to run a tax

53
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,728
For one thing you end up with companies spending billions and billions of dollars on tax lawyers and

54
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
Counting schemes

55
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568
Rather than spending that money on you know making better stuff

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,616
Also Leslie says there's this other problem

57
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,968
Some companies get their deductions way more than others so when the feeling really unfair

58
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,784
Yeah and every few years politicians

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
We have to fix

60
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,880
Let's lower the rate let's get rid of some of these loopholes

61
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,512
President Obama try to do it a few years ago and President Trump and republicans in Congress are trying to do it right

62
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
Billions of dollars

63
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,400
Thousands of billions of dollars at the bank

64
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
Artistic

65
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,800

When President Trump and the Congressional Republicans released this text

80
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
A few weeks ago

81
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
They published

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
A document

83
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208
9 pages long

84
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
They called it a framework

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
Not a plan

86
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
Supreme

87
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
In which they're going to do there

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,632
We have the framework and we are going to walk

89
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,984
Today we're going to tell you how it all adds up and we're going to find

90
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,848
Surprise we are Redemption money

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
Let's do it

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,248
Let's start with the headline that is a thing everyone is going to be talking about which is the Republican framework

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
Lowers

94
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,040
The corporate tax

95
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
And this is the easy

96
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,160
This is the thing that corporations will love it's not like

97
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:12,928
They're going to

98
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,744
Call up the congressperson and say like wait a minute what

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,839
Why are why are you lowering my taxes I just wanted to pay more money

100
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,143
So the rate right now is 35 /

101
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,215
The greatest year in the framework on page 7

102
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
Tax structure for corporations

103
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,079
The framework reduces the corporate tax rate

104
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
To 20%

105
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
.

106
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
20%

107
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967
Now there is

108
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,039
This issue right you lower the tax rate from 35 to

109
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
To 20% there is this

110
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Obvious consequence

111
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
The government is going to collect a lot less

112
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Tax revenue

113
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,695
Right

114
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,767
According to the committee for a responsible federal budget a non-profit

115
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
Over the next

116
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
10 years the government would collect

117
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
1.9

118
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
William fewer dollars

119
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,703
1.9 trillion dollars

120
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,519
1900 billion dollars

121
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
What else is it

122
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
It is 1.9 million million dollars

123
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
Hole in the budget

124
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
But

125
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
To be clear the rest of the framework

126
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
The rest of our show is

127
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,183
Feeling that hold back in right not only are they lowering the rate

128
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
They're getting rid of those production

129
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Exemption

130
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,583
Or as they will probably say loopholes cuz you're getting rid of them

131
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Todoroki

132
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Hundreds of bees

133
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Houston attack

134
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,007
Each one has some reason for being some particular compelling story

135
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
Let's just take one

136
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
What are the few that is

137
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
Actually mentioned by name

138
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
In the Republican tax

139
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
Framework it is called

140
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,527
Section 199 it has its own little story like all of these

141
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,063
This one starts in mm

142
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,135
Congress created section 199 of the tax code

143
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
A tax break for domestic Manufacturing

144
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,071
Building stuff guys with mustaches with

145
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:00,447
Forklift moving things back and 40 gold pieces of metal Cougar Mellencamp singing in the corner yet

146
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
So this becomes law in mm

147
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,823
And a few hours later a text learn and Ken silverberg

148
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
He gets a call from a company

149
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,431
That wanted to claim a deduction under section 199

150
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
They would

151
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Bye

152
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
Crackers

153
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
Cookies candies

154
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
And arrange them

155
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,903
In an artistic and beautiful way

156
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
Rapping

157
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,255
Attractive bows for apps

158
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
Put some

159
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,863
Decorative items inside the basket what company made gift

160
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
The CFO

161
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
Went to a tax conference

162
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
And he heard some speaker

163
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Talking about this

164
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
Section 199 deduction that was available for

165
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
For companies that

166
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
Did manufacturing and he says

167
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
Why can't we use

168
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
And can the corporate tax lawyer says

169
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
You can't and this is your classic

170
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
Tax break story right

171
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,743
Congress opens a little door in the tax code for a specific industry

172
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
When everybody calls their tax lawyer and says hey

173
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
Get me in that door

174
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,191
So the gift basket Company claims the deduction and eventually the government like wait wait wait

175
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,847
No you can't do that you were literally just putting cookies and crackers and wine into a basket and the case went up in court

176
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
Government is saying

177
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,223
If is not manufacturing and 10 and his colleagues are arguing yes it is

178
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,527
This company is making a new thing

179
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Gift basket

180
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
They are men

181
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,647
It looks just like the assembly line in any fact

182
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
Sam's forklift trucks driving

183
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,559
Across the floor bringing stuff to the beginning of the assembly line

184
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
You have

185
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,447
Lines of workers sitting there putting things together and

186
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
Mini conveyor belt

187
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
So many conveyor belt

188
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:44,127
Show me conveyor belt the judge agrees with Ken and the gift basket company

189
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
They can get a manufacturer

190
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
This ruling came down in 2013

191
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,063
And it's part of this push that has been going on

192
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,391
Frankly since section 199 has been in place

193
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,695
We're more and more companies one

194
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,279
There was something called the Starbucks footnote way back there

195
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
Beginning that basically meant that Starbucks

196
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,935
Coffee roasting could count under Section 199a dentist

197
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,031
Started cleaning this for making crowns are we manufacturing a podcast

198
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,127
I don't know film companies can do it cuz they are producing

199
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
IMovie

200
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
They got it

201
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,991
So this proliferation has not escaped congress's notice

202
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,039
The framework the Republicans release reset

203
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
Delete it is thin on details but it does

204
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
Call out this

205
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,975
Section section 199 page

206
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
8

207
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Clojure framework

208
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
Because of the Frameworks of

209
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,143
Stancil reproduction for all businesses

210
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Bcrypt lot domestic

211
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,495
Production section 199 deduction

212
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
Will no longer be necessary

213
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,103
What's the best way to put it we're getting rid of it

214
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
It's no longer necessary

215
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:53,247
Oh yeah I'm getting rid of this section 199 deduction it will bring in an extra

216
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
106

217
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
60 billion dollars

218
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
For the government over the next

219
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:03,743
Okay okay so lowering the corporate tax rate what's the government in a 1.9 trillion dollar

220
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:10,655
Eliminating this one deduction brings an extra hundred and sixty billion dollars

221
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
Yeah but this is just one deduction

222
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,567
There are more another big one that the Republicans are proposing is going after the gigantic

223
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
Pile of money

224
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
Corporations are holding

225
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,407
Outside the United States

226
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,431
It is just

227
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
Sitting there for the taking

228
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
And Congress wants to

229
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Drag it back

230
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,111
Lots of companies are holding cash outside

231
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
When you hear a lot about is Apple

232
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
Because they have more than 200

233
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
Billion dollars

234
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
Sitting outside the US

235
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,351
Apple of course is an American company they just built their big

236
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,911
Spaceship headquarters out in Cupertino

237
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
But

238
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,239
When Apple sells an iPhone and say

239
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,335
Hamburg Germany the profit does not go to Apple in California

240
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
No the money goes to

241
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,943
Foreign subsidiary that is owned by Apple

242
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,503
Some company did Apple created and controls

243
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
Outside of United State

244
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
The way that us tax system works now

245
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,927
Apple does not have to pay us corporate tax

246
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
On that money from the iPhone they sold in German

247
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,863
Until the subsidiaries sends the money back to Apple in California

248
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,679
So not surprisingly Apple subsidiaries

249
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
Does

250
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,287
Not send the money back to Cupertino California they hold onto it

251
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,383
So you have to pay the tax and you're after your Apple and all these other companies are doing

252
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,687
And his pile of money is just getting bigger

253
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
And bigger and bigger

254
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,039
Anno how politicians love to talk about

255
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,391
This pile of money I happen to think it's double that's probably five

256
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,975
Trillion dollars that we can bring into a country Leicester

257
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
And with a little leadership

258
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
You get it in here

259
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,911
Very quickly and it could be put to use on the inner cities that a lots of other things

260
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,495
And it would be beautiful

261
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Be able to

262
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,823
Use amounts of money

263
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:59,711
Countries with zero tax

264
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Where do I go

265
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,319
That is one of the things I asked Leslie Robinson that dirt

266
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Like where is that money

267
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
What what is that money where is it

268
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
I think most of it's in New York

269
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,607
Waiting New York like right next door to you

270
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,703
So you eat an intricate you're talking about the money

271
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,543
Us corporations are holding abroad the money everybody like

272
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,615
We need to get them to bring this money back to America

273
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
You're right

274
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
It's in New York

275
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
I believe so

276
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,991
I don't understand like

277
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
What does that even mean

278
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,063
What does that even mean

279
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,671
So holding cash abroad is it has a little bit of a misnomer

280
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Yes

281
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,767
Apparently this is confusing

282
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,095
Yes yes it is so what Leslie Robinson told me is

283
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,887
The company only has to pay tax

284
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Foreign subsidiary

285
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,727
Fins the money back to

286
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Us head

287
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,055
If a foreign subsidiary wants to do so

288
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
Something else with the money including putting it in a US Bank

289
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
That's fine

290
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
The government will not tax it

291
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,991
From now until forever

292
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
That's where the corporate tax works now

293
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:10,367
The big question what is the Republican plan

294
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
For this big pile of money

295
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,463
Robert I'm going to go to page 9 of the framework

296
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Yeah I'm going to paraphrase

297
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,559
9

298
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,119
A corporation that big pile of money

299
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
We are texting it

300
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
Right now whether it's in gold bars in Switzerland

301
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
Or the New York bank account

302
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
You are going to pass text

303
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
And this is

304
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
This is a lot of money

305
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
Yeah this is big

306
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
Asterisk

307
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,503
And by asterisk I mean

308
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:42,879
They're going to text this money but they will almost certainly texted at some special Lo

309
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
The framework it does not say

310
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Weather radar

311
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,303
So I ask somebody whose job is to kind of figure these things out

312
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,703
His name is Michael mundaka he worked on taxes in the Obama Administration and he now works in Washington for e&y which

313
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Pictures of giant

314
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
How much I get a text

315
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
The best guess is somewhere around 10%

316
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
So more or less

317
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
About how much money

318
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
Multiple hundred

319
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
Billions I would think

320
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,551
Now we're talkin money this is the money

321
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,671
The one other thing to remember about this money though double asterisk

322
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,463
If this is a one-time deal right this

323
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
Just applies to the pile of money

324
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
That exist

325
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
Right now sitting outside View

326
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,447
But the framework also addresses what's going to happen in the future to Foreign Press

327
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,823
It says in the future companies will have to pay some minimum tax on foreign profit

328
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
Fits when they're

329
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
It'll be a low rate

330
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
But no more letting them pile up for it

331
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Okay

332
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,223
Try to make this clear if

333
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
Republicans passed their text

334
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:46,367
Plan if some us companies reporting all of its foreign profits in some

335
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159
Offshore low-tax

336
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Foxhaven

337
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
The US government is going to say

338
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
Pay up every year you all

339
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Thumbtack

340
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Exactly right okay

341
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
So let's

342
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,119
Take this whole framework

343
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,911
What's all the numbers

344
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
See how pencils out

345
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
I will do that

346
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
After the break

347
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:07,359
Support for this podcast and the following message come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

348
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,943
Developing solutions to support strong families and communities

349
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,271
To help ensure a brighter future for America's children

350
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,087
More information is available at aecf

351
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
. org

352
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Billiards pool

353
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,951
The framework to The Story So Far

354
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
There's this massive cut in the corporate tax

355
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
35

356
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
To 20%

357
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
And

358
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
The framework doesn't

359
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,119
Explicitly mention a few ways

360
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,423
The government is going to make more money

361
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,727
Getting rid of section 199 Manufacturing

362
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,031
I'm texting that pile of money held overseas

363
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
Couple other things

364
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
But

365
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Just like

366
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,431
Roughly adding the stuff up here but it seems like the government

367
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
The US government is going to lose far more money

368
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,783
From cutting the tax rate

369
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
It's going to make back from closing loopholes

370
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,647
So there is this one

371
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
Other sentence

372
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
In the frame

373
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
It's very important sentence

374
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
And it's a very Biggs

375
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
I talked about it with Michael

376
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,631
Oh so she hears the setting

377
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,679
To get inside of

378
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
In addition numerous

379
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:10,335
Other special exclusions and deductions will be repealed or restricted

380
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Yes

381
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,919
We're going to do it we're going to get rid of those loopholes

382
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
That's what they're saying

383
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Do you believe it

384
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
It's

385
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:23,647
I think why they don't list them here because I think I want to create Targets this early in the process

386
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,927
This is going to be

387
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
Top whenever the house

388
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
Comes out

389
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
More specifics around

390
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,583
Could be as soon as later this month

391
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,375
Then you'll see

392
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
The high gear drive to

393
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
Get

394
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:36,959
Those

395
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775
Special Provisions maintained in whatever new tax system

396
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
That is like

397
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
If you're a company and you and play a Lobby

398
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,919
That is the moment when you want the lobbyists to

399
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Do every phase of their so

400
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Super Bowl

401
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,759
Sisters

402
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,807
I'd like I always lose when I go

403
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,855
That is like an ordinary schmuck

404
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
I need an alarm

405
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
:-(

406
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,975
Do you think it's a reasonable way to feel it is

407
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,047
Cuz you don't have someone going up there and argue

408
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Why you're special

409
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
Yes or arguing

410
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Like

411
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,447
Why nobody should be special and everybody should just pay the same

412
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,775
Text whatever the rate is it could be high or could be low just

413
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,335
Pay it right like that that's what we want

414
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
That's what we want

415
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
But is that what we're going to get

416
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,271
Not according to Montauk I mean he says

417
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
His best guess

418
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,135
Is Congress will probably cut the corporate tax rate

419
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,207
Maybe not all the way to 20% but probably somewhere in the low twin

420
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,023
Probably will get rid of section 199a

421
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
He says he will tax that money held overseas

422
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
But he says

423
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
A lot of the other

424
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,215
Special corporate tax rules those are probably going to

425
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Which means bottom line

426
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
If this thing passes

427
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
The federal government

428
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,407
They just wind up collecting less money overall

429
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
From the corporate

430
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,343
