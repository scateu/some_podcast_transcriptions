00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:03,584
Support for NPR in the following message come from Pushkin and Des

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:06,144
Presenting the podcast against the rules

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,984
Michael Lewis explores the corrosion of fairness in America

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,544
And what it has done to our society mostly

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
Without our noticing

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,640
Listen to against the rules wherever you get your pot

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,504
Do you remember what the subject line was on

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,320
The email that you double clicked on

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,136
Exactly verbatim

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,696
But it had to do with

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,488
A document

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
4

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,072
For our record

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,864
This is Mavis Jesus

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,632
Supervisor at

16
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400
Hair Company

17
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,960
And we're only using her first name in this story for read

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,008
Become very clear in a minute

19
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,288
And that email she got

20
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,080
That was from someone she actually knew

21
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
But it seems a little

22
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
Off

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,944
And I replied to the email and I said

24
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,248
Are you sure this was meant for me

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
And

26
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,320
Came back and said oh yes it's for you

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,392
And that's when I clicked on there

28
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,672
Email wow

29
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
What did it look like

30
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,720
It really

31
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
Had nothing to do with

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,816
The type of documents

33
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
That I deal with

34
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
So right away it was like oh

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
This is

36
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
You know I'd

37
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,752
And never really thought anything of it

38
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,080
Then a few days later Mavis was in her scent box

39
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
Looking for another email

40
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
And that

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,408
That's when she saw

42
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,968
Her computer all on its own

43
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:24,992
Sending out

44
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:25,760
Email

45
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,040
And you're just saying

46
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,368
Sin sin sin sin sin sin sin sin sin sin sin sin sin

47
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
And then right there was like

48
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
Crap

49
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,024
And not just because she realized she'd made a mistake

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,352
But because she knows breaking into her particular account

51
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,400
Is incredibly serious

52
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,936
She's not only a supervisor

53
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
She's a supervisor

54
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
Financial Services

55
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,056
I thought for sure I was going to get fired

56
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,664
Yeah no hands down Mavis new her account was a

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
A hacker's

58
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
A motherload of

59
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,040
Social Security numbers banking information

60
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
Retirement accounts

61
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,392
With bank statements and wiring instructions help

62
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
Polly attached and she was just thinking

63
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,000
Life made such a dumb mistake

64
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
And then you think of

65
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,840
The time in the money

66
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,912
They can't end up having to spend

67
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,848
It feels awful to be the person who did something like that

68
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,432
But all kinds of companies are going through this right now

69
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,832
Marriott Chinese hackers Target they are hacking into cash registers the Democratic National Committee

70
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:37,184
That one was also fishing there were so many hats so often

71
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,208
This point

72
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
It may feel like

73
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
There's no way to stop it

74
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
But there is a ray of Hope

75
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:49,216
It's a little old-fashioned and very low talk about as low-tech as you can get it's been around for hundreds of years

76
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:56,128
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Dina temple-raston and I'm here indefinite Dina is here with us

77
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:02,528
Today reporting the story but she is covered terrorism and technology for NPR and while we've all been searching for some fancy

78
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,320
High tech solution to all these hacks

79
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,672
Age old remedy has been sitting in the corner biting its time

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Waiting for us to notice

81
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Can a Dusty old Financial tools called one of the most modern problems in the world today on the show

82
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,680
We introduce you to a cyber SWAT team and tomatoes

83
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
And some friends in Nigeria

84
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
Urgently require your attention

85
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
Support also comes from Delta

86
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,528
Delta flies to 300 cities around the world that's 300 cities

87
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,088
It's where many people do the same things you do

88
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:43,488
That's 300 cities were people in those 300 cities think they're the only ones who know about that

89
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
That one place

90
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,816
And 300 cities where people miss him

91
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,888
One and one of Delta's other 299 citic

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,240
Delta isn't flying to 300 cities merely to bring people together

93
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,312
But to show that we're not that far apart in the first

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Delta

95
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Keep climbing

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,712
What meat is sweating over what she was afraid might have been a hack

97
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
Her boss Wendy was on a business

98
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,552
Blissfully unaware

99
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
How serious this all was

100
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Until the dark

101
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
I got a phone call from a very important

102
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
Business partner of ours

103
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
And

104
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,536
No they're unhappy

105
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,583
The phone call was from one of the companies

106
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Baked clams

107
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
And they told Wendy

108
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,935
We just got this really weird email for

109
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
From Mavis and they say we've been hacked

110
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,519
Using an email that

111
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
A lot like

112
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,359
Any chance you guys got hacked

113
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
Oh my

114
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
This is big

115
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
It made me shaken

116
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,039
Wendy had been preparing for this for years

117
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
She knew exactly what

118
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:46,719
To do turn to that old-fashioned tool we talked about something a lot more people have been doing lately she pulled a big black bee

119
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:50,047
Binder off the credenza in her office and started flipping through the pages

120
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,631
And she finds a phone number in big block letters and

121
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,655
Begins to dial

122
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:59,007
You have reached the data security event hotline provided by the law firm of ma

123
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
We get a call a day

124
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
But at least

125
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,967
Just Happening all the time that's Cristiano and he's a data privacy lawyer with melancholy

126
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
Anytime someone calls that hotline

127
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
He gets a text on his phone it just says

128
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:16,671
Somebody called and it's it's got the recording attached to it

129
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
The first responder to hacks like this for the very specific

130
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,839
Initial discussion will be protected by the attorney-client privilege

131
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,703
Thank you and someone from Mullen Coughlin will be in touch with you shortly attorney-client

132
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
Privilege with a lawyer on the line

133
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,079
You can admit to the most embarrassing parts of the hack

134
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
Without ever being worried it'll get out later

135
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
If you wind up in court

136
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
That's kind of Genius

137
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,039
Super Genius and Chris is part of Wendy's secret weapon that we mentioned

138
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,135
Because about a year ago as if she had foreseen poor Mavis

139
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,927
Clicking on that fateful email

140
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
When do you have purchased

141
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,511
Protection something fairly Cutting Edge

142
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
She bought

143
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
Cyber insurance

144
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Now there's been insurance for computer businesses for a while back in the 1990's you could get insurance for

145
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Errors in data processing

146
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
What the internet introduced

147
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,079
A ton of new threat

148
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
It got so bad

149
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
It was even a big turning

150
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
In 2003

151
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,247
The California security breach an information

152
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Made it to

153
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
The company got hacked

154
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
They couldn't keep it secret anymore

155
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,415
They had to notify residents if their information was still

156
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,231
Which is how this started to get really X

157
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,559
Not just because having to admit to a hack might prefer

158
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Lawsuits

159
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
PR problems

160
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
Also just the cost of telling everyone

161
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
Not to mention me be having to fund

162
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,263
Credit reports are some other remedy to make amends

163
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,847
Tunnel starts to add up which is where insurance comes in

164
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
It protects you against the unforeseen

165
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,199
WeatherTech home invasion health problems

166
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
Or even a hack

167
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
Pay a little now so you don't get stuck with a big

168
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,295
Delator

169
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
Cyber Insurance be

170
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Become the new new thing

171
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,927
Cross the Country Insurance Brokers are now selling

172
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,255
Literally thousands of cyber policies every single day

173
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
And what companies get for their money

174
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
Are people like the

175
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
This lawyer Chris

176
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
And this

177
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,679
Navigate to emergency response teams for North America

178
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
Incidence

179
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
A response

180
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
Steven Seagal SWAT team

181
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Prescriber

182
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,615
You certainly could think of it like that yes ma'am

183
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,943
He works at a private company called Kroll cyber risk

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
And he used to be an FBI agent

185
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,039
He was chasing hackers for the feds

186
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,599
Thnxcya side but inside a computer

187
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,927
To keep that sweet sweet attorney client privilege intact

188
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
Chris the lawyer

189
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,791
Conferences in Devon the former FBI guy with Wendy

190
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,815
Madison spas

191
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,167
Sounded like an emergency call an emergency call and that's the way that they treated

192
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
Devin goes to the crime scene

193
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Gmail account

194
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:43,615
And he starts investigating and what we'd look for our kind of weed but I would equate to the fingerprints

195
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,687
Of the actor of the bad guy when they're in the account

196
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,783
Step one you can think of a essentially dusting for digital

197
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:56,159
Devon find a foreign IP address from Lagos Nigeria in mavis's account

198
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
We then realize

199
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
That we had unauthorized access we could

200
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
Firm on the account

201
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
Frittata.

202
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
4 days

203
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,399
A hacker in your account for 4 days

204
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,703
Is a really long time in a phishing attack

205
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:13,055
And this is what he could do with 4 luxurious days in her account

206
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
Rifle through it in search of

207
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Gold

208
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
We did this in a very simple way

209
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,015
Just type into the search window at the top of the email account

210
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
Payment

211
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Wiring a

212
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Instructions

213
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
Wire train

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,023
And a host of other financially related search vim

215
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,631
He wrote them to a folder she never used called an RSS feed

216
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,191
Wait is this like a folder that all Outlook

217
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
They do if you look under your scent

218
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
It's right there

219
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
Oh I have one

220
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,383
Place wheel did no idea with nobody uses it

221
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
So he replied

222
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,199
Pretending to be Mavis

223
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,223
And he basically says

224
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
Are routing numbers changed

225
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,575
Please send it to this bank account instead

226
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
But lucky for Mavis no one

227
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:03,743
Feel like a for effort Nigerian hacker but you get zero cash

228
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,511
0 cash

229
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,607
On his way out the door though the hacker sent out of party gif

230
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
Actually they were a whole bunch of

231
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,471
The movie called burning of the account

232
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
Where they send out spam emails

233
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
And they move away from the account they don't come back

234
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,687
The scent scent scent scent thing that made us all when she realize what it happened

235
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
That was in the hacker coming in

236
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,015
That was him going out

237
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,111
Those thousands of emails to be sent on his way out the door where the hacker

238
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,439
Virtually inviting mavis's entire contact list

239
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
The click on a link

240
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
XOXO

241
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
Migas

242
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Chase Suites

243
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,583
So this investigation is over

244
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
And insurance help them

245
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Through that phase

246
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,679
Spray paint for people like Devin

247
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
The next step is preventing

248
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
The next

249
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,871
And this new Cyber Insurance helps them do that too but in a way that's not as obvious

250
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
Hackers going to hack We Can't Stop

251
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,015
But there are two sides to every relationship

252
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
Packers

253
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
And the maven

254
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
Wendy and her insurance policy can do is

255
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,207
Focus on the mavis's here's the lawyer Chris

256
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
Getting a shin insurance policy to cover cyber

257
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,351
Requires you to ask some hard questions about

258
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
Your data security knowledge

259
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
And that

260
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Has to make you wanna

261
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
Change your behavior change your behavior

262
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
That's the other thing Insurance helps you do

263
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,359
I always thought insurance was just about

264
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Risk pooling Actuarial tables

265
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
But it's really about

266
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
Behavior and changing it

267
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,527
Insurance sets up

268
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
Very simple mac

269
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
Mechanism

270
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
You want to take risks

271
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
Then you pay more

272
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:40,767
For your insurance you want a discount then you better shape up and they offer the most effective motivation known to man

273
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:44,607
I assume you're talking about a mother's love well know even more than that

274
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Monday

275
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Sorry Mom

276
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,983
If you want to get a lower cost on your homeowners policy

277
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
You have to install it home security

278
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
If you quit smoking great

279
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
Here's a discount on your health care

280
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Motivation

281
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
It's all motive

282
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,991
I was with Wendy when she got a motivational email

283
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
From her insurance

284
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,343
I emailed her agent this morning cuz I just hadn't heard anything

285
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Knowing that we are

286
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,743
AIG coded the renewal with limits

287
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,071
With a 66% increase

288
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,679
An increased the retention from 10000 to 25000

289
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
That's the deductible

290
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,263
Increasing your premium by 66

291
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
6% and more than doubling your deductible

292
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
What motivates change

293
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:33,503
No Wendy has her motivation time to pass it on to the employees she puts her whole company through a

294
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
A cyber workout

295
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,599
Her program may sound familiar it included the

296
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,135
Be reliable Stand By Me

297
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
Mandatory Workshop

298
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
No Bagels no Bagels

299
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
We

300
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:49,375
Bring our employees together and we talked about security it included the obvious this is what you look for check the

301
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,983
URL followed by the more obvious and if you aren't absolutely shirt

302
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
Absolutely don't click on it also basic office hygiene or death circline we don't leave data laying around and

303
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
And if all of that doesn't work

304
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
There's always

305
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Fear in others

306
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,807
Consequences out there in and we know it

307
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:14,207
Do you think the behavior company-wide has changed you think if a phishing email got into their mailboxes they double-click

308
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,535
Our Behavior has changed internally because

309
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,327
People are more aware

310
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
They

311
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,703
They know that it can happen to anybody at any time

312
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
And they're more cautious

313
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,311
Wendy was able to convince a new insurance

314
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,359
Company that her new training program

315
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Actually work

316
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
She got a new policy with more coverage

317
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
But for less money

318
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:41,343
Not to second-guess Wendy or her new insurance company but I couldn't help but Wonder

319
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:45,439
Have they really changed how they really sosina copena I am a little sin

320
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
So I decided to run

321
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
A kind of cyber fired

322
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
Essentially

323
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Test the car

324
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
Test Wendy's employees

325
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,751
So I called up my old pal the investigator Devin to see if you could help me with a little

326
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
Fishing Expedition

327
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
Seven runs these kinds of tests for clients all the time

328
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
He artisanal ecraft emails with a

329
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:10,271
Pacific company in mind like if he was going to fish NPR it might say click here for free tote bags

330
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
For Wendy's company it was financed

331
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,135
Asian fact it looks a lot like the original email.

332
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
He wants the emails to look

333
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,767
Really close to something that you would actually get

334
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,559
I know that sometimes what happens

335
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
It's a slightly Miss

336
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,863
Spell the word like

337
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,911
Let's say one of my client

338
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,215
AIG Insurance

339
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:36,127
It'll be two eyes so it'll say aiig insurance is it something like that

340
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,687
What is this so Devin launch to sting offer

341
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,575
Hear Planet Money we are calling it operation Mavis ouch we told Wendy it was going to happen

342
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
But she didn't tell her employee

343
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
Hey Wendy it's Dina how are you

344
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
I'm good

345
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,679
Waiting to hear well I've got Devin on the line so that he can tell you himself

346
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,495
We fished your users

347
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
2 days

348
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,567
How many

349
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,383
We fished 109 users

350
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
And we had five users

351
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
Open phishing email

352
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,527
We had one of those 5 users

353
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
Click the link in the email

354
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:20,927
Continue to the fishing website in other words they put in their name and password

355
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,975
That is correct that's not good

356
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,559
So maybe things haven't changed as much as I thought

357
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:27,839
Then

358
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
When you surprised us

359
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
But I already know who it is

360
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
They self-reported MIA

361
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Yep

362
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,799
I got an email in our human resources in box

363
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
With a copy of the email from the person

364
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Saying

365
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
I should have done this

366
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
I clicked

367
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,223
I put in my info

368
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
So I called her it team and I had them scan my computer

369
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
One person

370
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
Now that might not sound like my

371
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
My progress book

372
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
But any hacker will

373
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
The difference between someone alerting it

374
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Right away

375
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,767
Anime this is

376
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
Case waiting for days

377
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
Well that's an attorney

378
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,983
There's a huge difference between say calling 911 minutes after heart attack and calling 911 4 days later

379
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
So the training worked

380
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
And Wendy is paying less for

381
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
Her insurance

382
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,407
The impact of a cold hard insurance policy

383
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
Actually a very human

384
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,783
It creates a system in which what I do affects

385
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
You get Whispers

386
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,391
We're all in this together and in doing so it becomes

387
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
Powerful force

388
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,975
Pushing the world towards safety good

389
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,279
Cision maybe even fewer have

390
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
It is so valuable but yet

391
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
So unnoticed

392
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
You just got a little mushy about insurance active

393
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
It deserves it

394
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
It's a beautiful thing

395
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
And that's great

396
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Nice work wind

397
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,127
But did Operation Mavis

398
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Catch Mavis

399
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,015
No it was not

400
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Good

401
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
It was not

402
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
People are getting smarter

403
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,159
There's a conscious decision that has to be made

404
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,487
You can have all kinds of these things that you put in place which we've done

405
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
But in the end it's the people that have to make those choices

406
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
And

407
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,167
We're relying on them to make good choices

408
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
Support also comes from Delta

409
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,663
Delta flies to 300 cities around the world

410
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,503
That's 300 cities where many people do the same things you do

411
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,903
That's 300 cities where people in those 300 cities think they're the only ones who know about that

412
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
That one place

413
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,487
And 300 cities where people miss someone

414
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,559
And one of Delta's other 299 cities

415
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:38,655
Delta isn't flying to 300 cities merely to bring people together

416
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,983
But to show that we're not that far apart in the first place

417
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
Delta

418
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
