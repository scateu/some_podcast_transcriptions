00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,480
We had this great idea for an episode

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
A few months back

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,296
Super clever way to deal with

9
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,576
This problem

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,184
Are corporate bosses that NPR decided that they were going to

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,720
Rehab R-Spec

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:37,376
Wreck everything down take everything out pull up the carpet it was extremely well

13
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,704
Oh no

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,008
Everything's gone to chairs the death

15
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,056
For a week

16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,592
The Planet Money Team rented

17
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,640
The temporary office at a wework

18
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,456
This is one of those co-working spaces that feel like a

19
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,760
A cross between a boutique hotel

20
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,064
And a student center to call it

21
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:00,672
Is this

22
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,976
Lounge Funk playing everywhere

23
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,304
Not inside the offices but in all the common

24
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,120
IHeartRadio

25
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,680
Oh but there was free beer

26
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
Deck Party Jackson Bagel Time and we thought we might do an entire show on we work and the

27
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
I need to experience there

28
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,176
But then

29
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,504
Esquire magazine came out with their article

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
Ennui work

31
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,552
Entitled

32
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
And I'm so jealous of this title

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,392
Sriracha is for closers

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,768
It was essentially the same story that we wanted to tell about the people who inhabit this world of wework

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
But if I'm being honest with myself

36
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
It was better

37
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,424
Just listen to this line from the stories writer Eric konigsberg

38
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,728
What might Willy Loman

39
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,288
Who ventured door-to-door with nothing but a smile and a

40
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Shoe shine

41
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,616

00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Yeah it's called

70
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:18,144
Promethea Unbound and it was in the atavist magazine it was written by a man named Mike Mariani

71
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,960
I'mma tell you what I love about the story I'm going to keep it really short

72
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:26,336
It starts out in a way that you've seen a hundred other new story start out right it's this single mother

73
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,920
She's very poor she's living out of a van with her five-year-old daughter

74
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,040
They have no money they're sleeping in parking lots are washing their hair and Fountains at night

75
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,440
And the mom is trying to not let on to her five-year-old that this is not a normal way to live right this is like

76
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
Derek Durand Dire Straits

77
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,376
She's keeping her entertained for the kids not enrolled in school but she takes her to the park she takes her you don't like little educational things

78
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:54,240
And very early on the store you weren't at the mom is planning the surprise trip for her 5

79
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
You're old and she's pregnant

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,152
Just like driving the van and she don't know where that goes yeah yeah

81
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,272
And it turns out that they are driving to Stanford University

82
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,624
And then you learn that they're driving to Stanford University

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
Linear

84
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Accelerator

85
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,208
Which is a top

86
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,815
Science lab and you're confused now cuz you're homeless mom and five-year-old daughter what is going on here

87
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
And in their there they're at Stanford to take

88
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
A tour of the linear accelerator

89
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,751
Any luck with your kids program know that or is it

90
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,079
College professor is a college student in people who really interested in like 5th

91
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
And into the finished

92
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,199
And the professor was leaving it says does anyone have any questions

93
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,295
The five-year-old girl raises her hand and she says

94
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
Just like really seriously adult

95
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,023
Question about particles colliding in why the accelerator doesn't overstay for like what is going on in the story

96
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,815
And then it unspools

97
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
This little girl this five-year-old girl is a genius

98
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,215
No I don't want to spoil the end of the story

99
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,031
But I wanted to ask you as someone who is

100
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,823
A reporter and tell stories for live

101
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
What is it about the structure of the story

102
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Grabbed you

103
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
The basically makes you want to steal it for a future future podcast

104
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
Person who represents

105
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
Who's the Everyman who represents everybody

106
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Especially

107
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,023
That's right what you have in this case is a character who is so

108
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,047
Singular

109
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,423
Almost seems like she must be made up she must be Fiction it's like

110
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,007
You're reading this story and you feel like you're reading a novel

111
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
Because the character

112
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,103
Is so far from a cut out

113
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
She is

114
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
So extraordinary

115
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
End

116
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,783
And I think if you can write a 39 page magazine article

117
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,599
It reads like a novel

118
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
Mike Mariani hatts off

119
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,815
The name of the story is Prometheus Unbound and you can find it at the enema status. Com

120
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Thank you Robert

121
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615

That's true reveal what it is

126
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
My Valentine goes out

127
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
To Samir madani

128
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,415
This guy who spends every night

129
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
Tweeting

130
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:24,255
Where oil tankers are around the world

131
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
Like tweeting out

132
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
The location of

133
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Oil tank

134
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
It's like Trainspotting for oil tank

135
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Exactly

136
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,495
He's made this group of people all around the world

137
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
Who are tweeting with

138
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
And they're called

139
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,639
The organization of oil trading tweeters

140
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
This is not an official organ

141
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,319
It is not an official organization it is modeled after an official organization OPEC

142
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
The organization of the

143
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
Petroleum exporting

144
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,951
But this hashtag in this group

145
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
Has transformed the world of oil

146
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
We should say that you have

147
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
Extensive experience

148
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,399
In in doing stories about oil so it's not just a random

149
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,215
Impressed it's not totally random but

150
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
I also just love the high seas

151
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
And they're Nazis they're the high seas

152
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,407
Why is that such a weird thing

153
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:16,991
I'm going to look at the hashtag OOTD

154
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
Xian Twitter

155
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
This is real thing

156
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
It is

157
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,183
I want the first one that comes up is

158
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,767
Standoff in the high seas as Cyprus says

159
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Turkey block

160
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
Gas

161
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Drillship

162
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
Hashtag

163
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,447
Yep this is the type of drama yeah

164
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
The sky Samira madani

165
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:44,639
Why does he do this is John know this isn't his job he's a technology executive

166
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,223
And every night he goes online and this is his entertainment

167
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
Uses satellites and Report

168
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
And he looks at anchors all around the world

169
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
And he sees some pretty crazy stuff

170
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,439
Shenanigans

171
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
Odyssey

172

Arrange things so Francis

173
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
Suntransfers

174
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:07,679
What happened in the clandestine manner do switch off their AIS trans

175
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Finder

176
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,519
And a transfers oil bye-bye hoses

177
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,359
They're transferring oil using hoses from one ship to another

178
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,895
Yeah Odyssey

179
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
I mean you're watching the stuff on folding it's so excited

180
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,783
You really don't need Netflix

181
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,807
Senior Life

182
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
They should be paying me to watch this stuff

183
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,279
So we just did our planet money space Series where we talked to a lot of people who use

184
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:38,143
Satellite various other spy means to essentially do the same thing

185
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
Track ships around the world

186
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,751
Any ideas there are Commodities traders who can

187
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,567
Make a lot of money if they figure out that

188
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:50,687
There is a too much oil in this place and not enough oil in that place and there's oil headed between them

189
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
So I understand the green part of

190
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
I don't understand why would you just do this

191
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
For free

192
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
Yeah I mean

193
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,623
She just

194
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
He's an oil nerd

195
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,231
There are a lot of other oil nerds all around the world

196
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,535
They're sitting there they're totally lonely

197
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
Until summer

198
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,935
Comes around with this hashtag now they can talk to each other and share this information

199
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
The club it's a club

200
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,287
And in this club sometimes pirate show up

201
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
What about to go crazy

202
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:24,735
Thank you Julia thank you Robert

203
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
With us now

204
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
Is the editor

205
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,279
A Planet Money Bryant or Steph

206
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
We should say before you give your Valentine

207
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Where did you grow up

208
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
I grew up in New York City on the Upper East Side

209
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
Yes you are city boy through and through

210
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Yes

211
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
And your Valentine goes to

212
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
Farm Show magazine

213
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
Okay

214
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,527
The describe the thing to me because you have this little tiny tiny magazine

215
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,343
What the size of the palm of your hand called Farm Show magazine

216
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,463
So Farm Show magazine is printed on newsprint as you can smell

217
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:12,351
And farm show magazine Paisley rounds up tips and tricks from what they call farmshop Wizards

218
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,399
Or Farmers all over the country and they

219
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
Basically just right in and tell people what they've done often it's projects they spent months working on and off on that solving problems that bother

220
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,567
All kinds of farmers

221
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
So can you give me an example

222
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Engine powered gopher killing machines

223
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Okay

224
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,271
Mini electric fence keeps mice out of stored machines

225
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:35,647
Wait to tiny little electric fence there. You can see the other tiny little electric fence it runs around the perimeter

226
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Okay

227
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
Texas ranch makes money raising butterflies

228
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
And my new favorite

229
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
Elevated bus makes great deer stand

230
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
No deer stand

231
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,519
For those of you who live in a city is

232
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
A place where you shoot deer

233
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
When you're hunting deer you

234
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,199
Basically waiting for them to show up and it can take a long time and a lot of people do it

235
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,735
On a little ladder in a tree

236
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,807
But this farmer has decided to do it in a school bus

237
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
Which he is mounted as you can see here

238
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
On a 28-foot high gas tank

239
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
Samantha the yellow school bus

240
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
Essentially up in the air what does it look like

241
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,351
10 20 feet up it looks like a flying school bus

242
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Which is basically is

243
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,471
Eddie Murphy's baby inside

244
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:26,079
There's a little table in a little place we can sleep in a setting like a microwave oven so sure

245
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,015
Why you can never ever ever where you live now in Suburban Connecticut use any of these

246
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,087
Why do you read this

247
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,135
I sit at my desk all day

248
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
And I dream of

249
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Solving

250
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,511
Problems that don't require a keyboard

251
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,327
And this magazine is just filled with people

252
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Usually who are probably living

253
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,727
Living pretty far from one another who want to communicate with each other who actually have solved problems

254
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,287
And there probably is someone else out there

255
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,383
Wondering how exactly to get his school bus up on a 28-foot gas tank

256
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Any instructions are inside

257
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,991
And I just want to be a part of that world even if it's only watching

258
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Farm Show magazine

259
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Out of Lakeville Minnesota

260
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,743
Make bread

261
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,303
Hello

262
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
I bring you my valentine

263
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,471
Stacey Vanek Smith visiting from the indicator how are you doing

264
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,799
So my Valentine is to a

265
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:29,823
Television show

266
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Show that I

267
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,711
Call the Victoria is about Queen Victoria it is

268
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Part of Master

269
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Theater

270
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
Anyway though it's like I watched the show.

271
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
You don't get away from work it's a sort of

272
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
Lovely Escapist Robbins very well.

273
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
Incidentally

274
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,327
But I was watching it the other day and

275
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
There's there was this hole

276
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Slotline

277
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
And

278
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
It reminded me of work so much I could not believe

279
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,847
The scene takes place in British Parliament

280
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
British Asian

281
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,943
When firming comes again

282
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,807
Find a polishing the toilet

283
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:17,439
The Corn Laws I can't believe it they're talking about one of the sort of

284
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
Fundamental historical moments in free

285
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:27,167
Yes exactly the Corn Laws were tariffs that were put in place to protect the threat of landowner Gentry

286
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
Reclass and they

287
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Basically made it impossible

288
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
Really really really expense

289
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
Import grain from other

290
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,919
Which made food very expensive in UK were talking 18

291
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,991
Yes and this became a huge problem during the Irish

292
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Potato famine

293
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,319
The Irish potato crops very famously failed

294
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
The Irish had

295
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
Nothing to eat

296
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,207
People were starving in record numbers it was horrible

297
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
Meanwhile these laws meant that importing

298
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,887
Green to send to the Irish people to save them from starving was almost

299
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
And so the prime minister at the

300
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
The time is man's Sir Robert

301
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,799
Give this big impassioned plea about

302
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
Repealing the Corn Laws essentially moving

303
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Words

304
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:14,527
Free Trade Street for the workers of this country who may not have votes but

305
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,927
You deserve no molestes to buy untaxed food fix the speaker

306
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,999
I commend this bill to the house

307
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,631
Can we talk about free trade Planet Money all the time this is a big topic met in the presidential election

308
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
Tariffs free trade all this

309
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
Stop it

310
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
It was amazing to just

311
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,543
Watch it and see it in all of its drama they should

312
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
Starving Irish

313
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,591
Peasants

314
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,919
Initial people yelling at each other in Parliament and

315
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,479
The royal couple got in a little

316
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
Fight about the Corn Laws and it was just

317
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
Really wonderful to see

318
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,903
Free trades with dramatized in this really

319
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
Amazing way with such

320
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
Beautiful costumes and

321
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:59,071
End of the passions that it allows for instance I mean I hope this isn't a spoiler

322
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,423
There is this man who tried to assassinate Sir Robert peel right after the vote

323
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
Passes to repeal the Corn Laws

324
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,567
Because he's a landowner nice or he's going to lose his livelihood now that

325
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
Green will be able to be imported from

326
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,479
Answer the bigger spoiler alert that you can't get rid of the Corn Laws

327
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:22,111
Embraces what I David Ricardo the great Economist called comparative advantage which is that countries

328
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
Should do what they are good at which

329
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
At the time was

330
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Making textiles and such

331
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
And it all

332
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
At least

333
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
As far as grade was concerned

334
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Workout for the

335
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Exact

336
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
Anyway it is

337
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
A grade

338
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
So I don't know if I should recommend it cuz

339
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,895
You don't have to later. Dramas with costumes but if you would like. Dramas with fussy costumes and like furtive glance

340

A valentine

371
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,343
Although I noticed that he is always sitting in the corner

372
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,623
Listening to some

373
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Yeah

374
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:03,231
I'm trying to block out the sound of all of my call

375
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
What do you listening

376
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,839
Before I tell you what I'm listening to I mean I think it's important for

377
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,119
For listeners to know that

378
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,495
The NPR New York office recently underwent some

379
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
You're already

00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:23,967

00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
Robert Smith UF

383
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
Okay it's very Charming it's

384
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,927
The Planet Money staff as a whole and I'm part of this is

385
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
Is a we are excitable

386
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,071
Often a little bit loud and so in the open space sometimes it can be a little over

387
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
That would mean that you

388
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
For those of you listening

389
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,703
Here's an example of what are office

390
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,775

Workwell Robert is saying what whatever that

397
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,303
If it's too hard to explain but it is not true about Canton

398
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Let's move on

399
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Okay

400
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
So

401
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:19,263
When you see me listening off in my corner with my headphones on I'm trying to concentrate

402
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
And

403
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
This is

404
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335

405
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
Is that water

406
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
Sound of relaxation

407
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,927
This is what you're listening to when I'm in my corner

408
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
With my headphones on

409
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255

None of this is this is what I have on my phone I have

Two different albums worth

415
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:07,135
I tried to find it binaural so if any listeners have any suggestions for binaural loon sounds I'm open to that

416
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:13,791
