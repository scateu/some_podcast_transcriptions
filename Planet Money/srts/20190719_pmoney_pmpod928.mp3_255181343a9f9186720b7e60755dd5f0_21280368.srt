And the following message come from Michigan Economic Development Corporation Cy Michigan is attracting top talent

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,752
And pop businesses by searching Michigan pure opportunity

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,848
Just a quick warning there's a little profanity

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,872
In today's show

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,176
In 1958

7
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,968
Jimmy Lai was 10 years old

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,576
He lived in southern China and he made money carrying suitcases at the local train

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,368
One day a guy garage

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,928
The train and told Jimmy he just come in from Hong Kong

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,488
Jimmy heard stories about Hong Kong before

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,072
It was supposed to be this magical unbelievably wealthy play

13
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,888
But you know Jimmy figured whatever people tell store

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,496
Jimmy was carrying the guys bags for the station that the guy started eating a chocolate

15
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:48,128
When they got to where they were going Jimmy put the guys bags down and the guy gave Jimmy the rest of the chalk

16
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,944
So I turned my back and tried it

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
And I said shut up

18
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,016
Wow what's this

19
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,552
He said chocolate

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,112
I said wow Hong Kong Must Be Heaven

21
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,160
You never tasted chocolate before

22
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,952
I never heard about

23
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,048
So I'd that moment not determined I'm going to escape

24
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
To Hong Kong

25
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:12,448
Escape to Hong Kong in the late 50s Hong Kong was not part of China it was a British colony

26
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,032
And this was a moment when China was closed off from the rest of the world

27
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:20,640
Chinese people were not allowed to set foot outside the country without special permission

28
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
From the governor

29
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,200
From the Chinese Communist Party

30
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,760
The party was radically remaking

31
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,112
They had Force Farmers to give up their land and work on Collective Farms

32
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
And partly as a result

33
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,464
At this moment when Jimmy Lai first taste of chocolate

34
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,048
China was in the middle of a famine that would kill tens of Millions

35
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
Soap to get out of China

36
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
Jimmy found a Smuggler

37
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
Who hit him in the bottom of a fishing boat

38
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
With a few dozen other people

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,056
They left around midnight and we're in Hong Kong the next after

40
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,432
He didn't have any money he had to go that night to start working at a glove Factory people like

41
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
12 and a half years

42
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
But the next morning

43
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,552
As he walked through the streets around the factory

44
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
So all these

45
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
Little food stamp

46
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
Ordinary People you know

47
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
Poor Factory workers like him

48
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,512
We're eating these big bowls of noodles and rice porridge

49
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Food was just

50
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Everywhere

51
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,144
Food everywhere and then the people sitting with you was

52
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
Cheerful

53
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
Such a beauty Norman on for me

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,848
That's when he realized that all the stories he heard about Hong Kong

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
They were true

56
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,152
I knew that moment

57
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,688
I'm in a different world

58
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,552
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob Goldstein

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
Hong Kong is this sort of impossible play

60
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,256
It's this capital city with a free press and freedom of assembly and an independent judicial

61
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Also

62
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
Hong Kong is part of China

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
A country with none of those

64
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,936
Jimmy Lai is an embodiment of all of that

65
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:53,312
He's one of the richest people in Hong Kong and also one of the loudest critics of the Chinese guy

66
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
Today on the show

67
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
The story of Jimmy Li is the story of Hong Kong

68
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
And the story of Hong Kong

69
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,552
Is the story of the 200-year relationship between China and the West

70
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
I mean

71
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,952
This message comes from NPR sponsor Microsoft

72

As an apex predator

73
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,584
The presence of snow leopards informs us about the health of their environment

74
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
That's why the snow leopard trust has turned to Microsoft AI to find and study these elusive at

75
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Animals with AI

76
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,080
It only takes minutes to analyze thousand

77
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
Since I've remote camera images

78
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
And understand where these animals are

79
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,272
So researchers have more time to protect them and their ecosystem

80
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296

83

Yeah between the 2020 debate and the president's battle over immigration

84

There's alot going on

To really understand the story of Jimmy Li and of Hong Kong and China and the West

91
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
You have to go back to the 1830

92
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,672
At the time China was almost entirely closed

93
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
If you are a traitor from Europe

94
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Orphan the US

95
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,559
It was only one place in China you are allowed to go

96
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,887
Town in southern China that westerners called

97
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Canton

98
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,983
Actually foreigners weren't even really allowed Encanto

99
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,543
I talked about this with Stephen Platt

100
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
A historian at the University of Massachusetts

101
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
The foreigners had to make do with

102
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,223
A little tiny compound about 12 acres

103
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,575
Outside of the city down and serve a muddy spot by the river

104
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,975
So why would these traitors sale halfway around the world to stay in a muddy 12-acre compound down by the river

105
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
To get rich

106
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:54,655
It was an incredibly lucrative trade basically the world source of tea at that point in time

107
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,239
Time was entirely from China in Canton what's the only place you could buy it

108
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,543
12 acres was it was

109
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,615
The center of an engine for the world economy essentially

110
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,455
But these traders who are getting rich in their little 12-acre compound

111
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
Started to bump up against a problem

112
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,575
The world and especially Britain wanted all this

113
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,159
But China didn't want that much stuff from the world

114
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,487
For a while Traders were just paying for the tea with silver

115
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,815
So much so that all the silver just started flowing into China

116
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,911
Eventually the traitors did find a product that the Chinese really were

117
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Opium

118
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,287
The British Traders became big-time International drug kingpin

119
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,615
Which then is now was a very profitable

120
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
They started ramping up opium production in India

121
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:44,319
I'm shipping it over it illegal to China where it was being sold off of the coast to wholesalers

122
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
And opium had become the largest for an import into China

123
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
End it

124
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
Had in fact undone the trade imbalance

125
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,471
To the point that the British were not only getting all the tea that they wanted but now they were starting to drain all the silver out of China

126
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,055
Opium was illegal in China but until this time

127
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
The government had sort of look the other way

128
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,943
Then as more and more people became opium addicts

129
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
And a silver started leaving the country

130
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
Deborah was like okay enough

131
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,391
He said one of his top advisors a guy named Lindsey shoot down to camp

132
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,183
Want to try and crack down on Oak

133
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
The British Traders opium is on ships

134
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Dinner options

135
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
It's not there in the car

136
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
Linda Shu he got second on and what he did was

137
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
He walked up the British merchants

138
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
In that 12 acre compound

139
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
And he said

140
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,823
I'm not going to let you out and I'm not going to let you trade anything else

141
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,871
Until you give me all your oppa

142
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
There is a British

143
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,223
Admiral who is in charge of trade at

144
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
His name is Charles Elliott

145
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,295
And he wants to settle

146
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,343
So he says to the traitors

147
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Okay

148
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:54,719
The British government will buy all of your open from you if you just turn it off

149
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
So they signed entire season Supply over to him

150
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,703
And then Admiral Elliott gave this mountain of opium to Lynn's issue

151
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,239
Who dumped it all in the

152
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
Who destroyed

153
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
We're gets back to London about what

154
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:15,199
But the British government does not send 2 million pounds to make good on Admiral Elliott

155
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Instead

156
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,831
The British send warships to force China to pay for the confiscated

157
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,159
The fact that this was a war fought over

158
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:30,559
Illegal drug dealers was not at all

159
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Holden started calling it

160
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
The Opium War

161
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
But by the time it ended

162
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
It was about way more than

163
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:42,335
By the time the war ends in 1842 it's turned into something much much bigger than what Elliott had believed

164
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Britain had any kind of a right to

165
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,223
Turn into a wart a forced China open to British trade

166
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
In the treaty that ended the war

167
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,087
The British demanded not only their 2 million pound

168
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,951
They also made China let foreign Traders into a bunch of foreign

169
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Canton and

170
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
Also Shanghai

171
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
And also a few others

172
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
And the British decided

173
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,679
We don't want to run the risk of some Chinese emperor locking up our trade

174
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
We need our own base of operations

175
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,031
We need a little British colony

176
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,127
So they made China give them this little rocky Island

177
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
Write off

178
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
The coast of Southern

179
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
Hong Kong

180
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
This is the beginning of what China calls its

181
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
Century of humiliation

182
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:28,159
Up until this time countries in the west had thought of China as this rich

183
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
Powerful Empire

184
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
Now they saved it can be pushed around

185
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,583
The Germans in the French get their own Colonial concessions from China

186
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,119
In 1898

187
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,471
Britain makes China give them a chunk of the land on the mainland of China

188
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
Across from Hong Kong

189
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
It's about 300 square miles

190
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
They call this piece the new tariff

191
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,687
And this particular land grab the British say is not forever

192
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
It's for 99 years

193
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
They say they will give the new territories back

194
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
In 1990s

195
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,391
When the British took over Hong Kong was this rural

196
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
2000 fishermen and farmers

197
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
But then

198
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,303
In the 1850s a civil war broke out on the mainland

199
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,655
And Hong Kong became a place people started fleeing to from China

200
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,775
There's a huge amount of fighting and it really vicious government Crackdown in South China

201
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:21,919
In a lot of wealthy Cantonese start moving to Hong Kong to be under the protection of the British

202
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:27,295
And it becomes a place where they can conduct their trade outside of the Civil War area

203
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
Tom and from there it really takes off

204
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,743
This really is the Hong Kong where Jimmy Lee climbs out of the bottom of that boat

205
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
In 19

206
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
This trading center

207
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
That is attached to Mainland China

208
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
That was created in the sort of

209
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
Original sin of the Opium War

210
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,775
That exists under the laws and Norms of the British Empire

211
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,591
And that has been populated mostly by people like Jimmy

212
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,151
People have fled China and the descendants of those

213
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
So you work in the factory

214
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
What making clothes is that what you're

215
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,063
Lithograph

216
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,623
Gloves making process

217
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,975
And you were like running a sewing machine or what are you doing

218
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,791
The first I was sweeping the floor all cleaning business

219
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
No umentary you know that

220
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,959
Betray me to be amateur so are you know I'm operating at the knitting machine

221
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,287
Yeah he works his way up and by 21 he's running a factor

222
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,383
Hong Kong by this point has become an International Financial

223
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,711
Place where lots of Western money flows on its way to a

224
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
And Jimmy start speculating in the Hong Kong stock

225
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
I need as well

226
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,391
He makes enough money to go in with a partner and buy a fact

227
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
Like a lot of factories in Hong Kong at the time

228
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,767
Is factory made clothes for foreign retailer

229
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
NECC spring companies

230
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
And selling it acute

231
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,143
Anythink

232
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
I should be the one selling at that

233
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,263
Joey decides to start a retail clothing

234
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
He doesn't know what to call it

235
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
Until he goes on a business trip to New Year

236
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,175
He's meeting with a clothing importer here in New York

237
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
And on the way out of the off

238
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
One of his friends at the company gives in this like

239
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
This little treat for the road

240
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,367
One of the importing company

241
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,135
Somebody

242
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
Supplication beer

243
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
Chocolate

244
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,839
Biscuit you know like cookie cookie cookie

245
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
Buy portable charger

246
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
Chocolate with

247
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Some marijuana dick

248
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
So I thought I took it I was

249
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:26,847
So high I was so hungry after I ate it I never was that hungry

250
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,895
So I just went into

251
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
A piece of pie

252
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
Okay

253
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,295
A piece of paper

254
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:40,415
So you know what the napkin that I clean my mouth I just put it into my pocket

255
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,183
Tobacco

256
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Went went

257
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
What's haidian Twilight

258
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
So this morning when I woke up I was at that time I was thinking about the name for for the retaining strap that I'm going to end

259
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
I'm going to stop

260
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Giordano

261
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
The name of the pizza

262
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,311
I want that's great you know people would think that I'm a

263
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Is that a true story

264
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
Yes that's if it seems too good to be true

265
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
I wanted to be

266
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
Yeah I Twilight

267
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,367
It's not too good to be true because when

268
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,719
Bright white was not very well at UK's a uniform meter thing about

269
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
A brand name is not easy

270
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
Sure Express 3

271
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
I think it's stupid idea to two

272
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Do you sleep

273
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,239
Italian names and thinking that people will assume YouTube

274
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,591
Retarded friend

275
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,639
By that time you know

276
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
Okay what the hell do I know

277
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
Jimmy launches Giordano in 1981

278
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:42,879
Eventually there will be Giordano clothing stores in more than 30 countries around the world

279
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Giordano will make Jimmy

280
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
Is Jimmy is building Giordano in the

281
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,559
There is like this Cloud hanging over his feet

282
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:55,423
In 1997 Britain is supposed to give the new territories in Hong Kong back to

283
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,263
But in China almost everything still belong to the government

284
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Most of China

285
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,615
You just could not be a rich entrepreneur like Timmy

286
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,711
At the same time though the British Empire was basically over

287
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
Britain was like

288
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,551
Getting out of the business of being a colonialist

289
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
But they were governed as a straight-up colony

290
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
Run by a British Governor appointed by the Queen of England

291
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
Controlled by British law

292
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
An extraordinary thing is how well it's

293
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,143
Hong Kong had become like this essential node between Asia and the West

294
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,703
So that by the late 20th century

295
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,055
People in Hong Kong we're not only profoundly better off than people in mainland China

296
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
People in Hong Kong were richer on average

297
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
Then people in Great Britain

298
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
Soap in the early eighties

299
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,039
Is the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping

300
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,111
Start needing to figure out what to do about hunk

301
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Patrick told dumb

302
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
Of course will give you back the new territories like we promised

303
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
But we never said anything about Hong Kong Island

304
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
Tolchester what if we just

305
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
Hold on to that

306
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,679
Here is Thatcher years later describing dunks

307
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
Icon

308
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
I said yes

309
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Dakota

310
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
There's nothing I can do to stop

311
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
But the eyes of the world

312
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
China was like

313
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,487
Everything would leave Hong Kong

314
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Angel song

315
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Lustrelux

316
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:37,311
Just to be clear this is Great Britain lecturing China about how it would look bad to take Hong Kong

317
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
Song by force

318
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,407
Deng Xiaoping was in some ways a practical

319
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,735
He was introducing capitalism in mainland China

320
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:50,879
And he knew that workers in capitalist Hong Kong were much more productive and had a much higher standard of living

321
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
Then workers on the Communist man

322
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
He didn't want to mess that up

323
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
So in 1984

324
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Dumb and Thatcher met Daddy

325
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,167
Great Britain would agree to give all of Hong Kong back to China in 1990

326
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,263
And China would agree to basically let Hong Kong

327
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,615
Keep being its own special thing governed by its own special laws

328
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
For 50 years

329
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
Until two thousand forty seven

330
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
And then

331
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,551
At midnight on July 1st 1997

332
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
It happened

333
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,487
There was Prince Charles all the people of Hope

334
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,559
Phone call who have been such a stone

335
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
I'm special friends

336
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
I was so many generation

337
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,519
There was Chinese president jiang zemin

338
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,799
Junk drawer

339
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,871
Jungian CNN.

340
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,247
At midnight they lowered the British flag

341
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
They raised the Chinese flag

342
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
And that was it

343
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,647
155 years after the end of the Opium War

344
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Hong Kong

345
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,231
A place as devoted as any on Earth

346
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
Capitalism and free trade

347
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
Was part of communist China

348
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
After the break

349
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887

367
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,199
By the time Britain handed Hong Kong back to China

368
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,503
Jimmy Lai was running a new kind of company

369
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
A kind of company that made this a dangerous moment

370
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,415
Few years earlier he'd been inspired by the tiananmen square Pro

371
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,535
Who wanted among other things more freedom of speech and less censorship in mainland China

372
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
And after the Chinese government

373
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,887
Declare martial law and killed hundreds of the protest

374
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,727
Testors Jimmy started a pro-democracy media company in Hong Kong

375
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
I said look

376
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,103
The best way to use my money is to go into the media

377
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Because

378
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
To deliver

379
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
Information

380
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735

Liberty

Liberty

383
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
Let's go into the

384
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
Freedom Fest

385
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
When the Handover happened in 1997

386
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,279
Jimmy was running a Weekly Magazine and a major Daily newspaper in Hong Kong

387
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,095
Both of them were openly critical of the Chinese

388
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,911
Were you worried you're going to get arrested then

389
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Next day

390
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,983
That never happened

391
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:51,359
I know it didn't happen but you didn't know the futuristic no I don't know the future but I just

392
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
I just

393
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
Lift My Life

394
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Day by day

395
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
What was the day like for the first day when

396
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:05,183
Hong Kong is no longer a British colony and is now a special administrative region of

397
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Nothing change

398
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
Venetucci

399
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
I'm sure people

400
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
People wear

401
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:15,167
Apprehensive about what's going to happen

402
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:18,495
Yeah okay but nothing changed and did you think still

403
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
You know I feel like the conventional wisdom in the West

404
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,615
At least at that time was

405
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:28,223
Well China is getting richer and we know that when countries get richer they become

406
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:34,623
More democratic and get civil freedoms

407
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Is that what you thought that's what we for

408
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,207
But that'll cost

409
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Do you happen

410
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
China has not allowed more freedom of speech

411
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
Publications can still be shut down for criticizing the cover

412
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:49,215
And yet China has gotten richer it started to develop its own Financial Center in Shanghai

413
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,311
Foreign money Canal flow into China without going through Hong Kong

414
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,359
So the Chinese Communist Party

415
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,663
Doesn't need Hong Kong as much as it used to

416
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,967
This has led to more and more tension

417
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
Between people in Hong Kong

418
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,807
And the Chinese Communist Party the Chinese

419
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:09,439
In 2014 there was a fight over how to choose the government official who runs Hong Kong

420
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,511
And a million people in Hong Kong took to the streets to protest

421
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:19,167
Just last month the government official who runs Hong Kong wanted to pass a new law that would allow people in Hong Kong to the x

422
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
Extradited to China to stand trial

423
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
The people in Hong Kong said

424
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
We don't trust your Mainland courts

425
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:27,359
2 million people protested in the streets

426
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
Including by the way Jimmy Li

427
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,943
Who is now in his seven

428
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
What was it like what was it like walking

429
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,831
When you see so many people

430
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
It is fighting

431
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,695
Emmolo issue

432
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
We don't have guns

433
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,047
We can have 10 we don't have anything

434
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,703
The only thing we have the Chinese government done is the model of 42 we have the moral courage we have

435
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
The moral Authority encourage you

436
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,567
Two weeks later on July 1st

437
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,151
On the anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule

438
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,223
Protesters broke into the Hong Kong legislature building

439
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
Smashed glass walls

440
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
And spray-painted

441
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,855
Chinese leaders see these protesters

442
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:13,439
And Jimmy life for that matter as agents for foreign in

443
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,999
You know basically Latter-Day colonialist

444
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:19,839
His house has been firebombed and there was an assassination plot

445
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Against him

446
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
I stop thinking about him

447
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,959
Just because I let the fear

448
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
Frighten me

449
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,519
I cannot go alone

450
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
You know because

451
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
With

452
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
What happened

453
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
I have

454
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
To substandard

455
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
I will be the last to leave

456
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,807
That is like a captain who cannot jump the ship

457
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
I mean you're you're rich

458
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,135
You could leave if you want

459
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,743
Yeah if I leave I'm rich but I'm an a******

460
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,071
What what what my kiss Roofing about

461
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
Being rich

462
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,911
You can be very poor

463
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Go on

464
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Play more because

465
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
If you only have money

466
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,895
You lost the meeting you lost addicted to you lost everything as a human being

467
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
What else do they have

468
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:12,063
In the end the big risk that Jimmy lie on the Hong Kong protesters posed to Beijing

469
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,855
It's not really about Hong Kong

470
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,623
Itself

471
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,440
Fat people on the mainland could look at Hong Kong

472
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Hey

473
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,256
We're going to break some windows to

474
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
We're going to start protesting he

475
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
If that happens

476
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,144
Beijing could send in the tanks in Hong Kong

477
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
And shut down the protest

478
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,104
