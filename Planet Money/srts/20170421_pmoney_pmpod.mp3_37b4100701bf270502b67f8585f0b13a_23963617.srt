1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:07,168
There was always something a little odd about Marin Quinn

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:13,568
Big tree Spanish moss it's a small town in Louisiana out in the country

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,968
About 1,100 people marinwood means mosquito in Cajun French to get there you Drive West

4
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:26,368
Baton Rouge across the Mississippi pass through sugarcane fields and cotton fields in their language

5
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,672
Everyone always seem to be related

6
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
In a way that was strange

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
Even for a small

8
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,048
When you greet someone in Maryland

9
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
Hey cuz

10
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,608
Hey cuz what's up cuz

11
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,168
Oh cuz what's up cuz

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,984
That's Deborah Tilson she grew up in Marin going

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,592
I just the thing that made the joke about everybody being cousins so funny

14
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,384
Was that it was actually true

15
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,176
But no one really knew why

16
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:55,040
It wasn't like there was a founding grandmother founding grandfather who come there first

17
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,576
At least not as far as they knew

18
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,600
It was just this

19
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,392
Series of coincidence

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,608
On the night I met Deborah we went to a town hall meeting in Maryland

21
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
And afterward we're standing around in the parking lot and we

22
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
Bump into this young police officer

23
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
Dipper asks him

24
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
Are you a heretic

25
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
And he said yeah

26
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,456
Anime start talking about people that they know when

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,528
Jennifer Nettles

28
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,600
Virginia James sister what's the name of

29
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,904
And I'm hanging out and I'm watching them

30
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
And I'm getting eaten alive by mosquitoes

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,096
And then I realize what's actually going on in this conversation between Deborah Tilson and the police officer

32
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:45,728
You didn't know that was your cousin

33
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
He didn't know I was

34
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:56,992
Can I ask you how you feel discovering that you're too newest cousin

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
This

36
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
That's Mandarin

37
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,600
That is married

38
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,440
A very small town that had some big mysteries about its path

39
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,512
Until a year ago when some of those Mysteries

40
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Warsaw

41
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,960
I'm Noel King and today on Planet Money we tell the story of what happens when people in this little town in Louisiana

Trump choose a well-known TV personality in Louisiana

56
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216

And morning show host and then a Morning Show anchor

58
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
Then a field reporter from there

59
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,456
She lives in Baton Rouge but she grew up in Marin going in the 50s and 60

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,552
Her family owned land in town but this was the Jim Crow South

61
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,624
And her dad worked a lot of jobs so that he could work for himself

62
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,024
He was a barber he was a farmer he on the blues Club on Wheelock Lane with a big Spotlight out front so he

63
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,864
Find it was called Hideout nightclub

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Kid where you allowed to hang out there

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,264
No

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,056
Maxine was a very curious cat

67
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,360
She was always pestering grown-ups with Quest

68
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
Growing up in the country parents

69
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,736
Don't often sit around

70
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,552
An answer kids questions during the culture

71
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,344
The culture of the country

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
Is go play

73
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
Her big question was

74
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
How did the family end up here in Marin

75
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
And she was curious because there were these mystery

76
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,607
With the family in Marin when was Catholic

77
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
And they were black

78
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,983
And they spoke English and this is a bayou town in Louisiana

79
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,079
Most of the Catholics I knew that were black French speaking

80
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
And and

81
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,687
You're from the body area where a lot of people speak

82
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
Sprint do you

83
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
Dislike no

84
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Is there anybody in your town

85
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,087
No none of the black people speak French

86
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:44,159
And then there was the story told by older people

87
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,975
Often not long before they died to the next

88
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
Maxine heard it from a 90 year old cousin

89
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
The story was

90
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
They had come from up North

91
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Cymbalta

92
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
I was thinking how did they get here

93
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
Blacks in travel during those days

94
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
It was during slavery

95
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,871
So what does he mean he came from you how to get here

96
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,967
Maxine grew up she left Marin Gwen but she still always wondered

97
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
MN once I need a little over a year ago

98
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,599
Maxine's driving out to Mary went to visit her mom

99
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Your cell phone rings

100
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
I answered my cell phone

101
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,951
And

102
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
Someone says my name is Richard Selene

103
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,559
And I have some information for you

104
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,095
About you a family

105
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
Maxine was like okay

106
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
But then this guy says a name

107
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Cornelius Hocker

108
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,591
There are five cornelius's in her family

109
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
And Hawkins was her grandmother's name

110
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,455
And so Maxine asks him what do you know

111
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
And he starts to explain

112
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
And as he does

113
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,343
I felt like my car was moving and that I had stopped

114
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,439
Here's the guy who is on the other end of the line

115
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:54,047
My name is Richard chillini and I'm a software and data executive in Cambridge Massachusetts

116
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,887
Richard is 53 he's a moderate Republican

117
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
Richard White

118
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
Yes I'm Caucasian

119
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,543
He's also a proud Alum of Georgetown University

120
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,591
The Jesuit college in Washington DC

121
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,223
I look Georgetown I went to Georgetown for to University degrees and I think it's fine Institution

122
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
One day in the fall of 2015 he's noodling around online and he sees a story in the student newspaper

123
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
The Hoya

124
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,231
Students are protesting an ugly part of Georgetown

125
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,351
In the early 1800s the Maryland Jesuits owned and ran towards

126
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
They also owned

127
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Thousands of Acres

128
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
And the Jesuits owned about 300

129
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
People

130
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Slaves

131
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Schoolworx their Plantation

132
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:42,175
In the 1830s Georgetown expanded and got itself into debt

133
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,735
It old Banks about $47,000

134
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,391
Shochu Jesuit priests one of them the president of Georgetown struck a deal to save the college

135
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,999
They sold 272 men and women and children

136
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
2 Planters from Louisiana

137
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:01,631
The sale brought in $115,000

138
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,911
In Georgetown

139
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
We saved

140
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:06,239
So which was reading this story

141
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,287
Any gets curious about those people

142
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
He wonders

143
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,871
What happened to them after they were sold

144
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,991
Georgetown had already set up a working group to examine its ties

145
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
To slavery

146
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
Richard wrote to a guy on that car

147
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,111
The guy writes back right away and says

148
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
We looked into it

149
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
Those people got down on Louisiana and they die

150
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,535
They all immediately succumb to a fever and what he described as

151
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
The malodorous swamp world

152
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
Of Louisiana

153
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,423
I looked at that email and I thought

154
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
That's just not possible

155
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,311
Even the Titanic had survivors

156
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,687
Richard remembers hearing that story at Georgetown back when he was an undergrad in the 80s

157
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
But now he realizes

158
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,015
It doesn't really make sense

159
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
To write this guy back and says listen

160
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
If you don't mind

161
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
I'm going to take a look

162
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:01,535
He goes online and he finds a digital copy of the bill of sale from 1838

163
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
With their names

164
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,143
The youngest was William he was 6 months old

165
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
The oldest was Daniel he was 80

166
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
Robert was sickly and

167
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
Steven was lame

168
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Betsy was married to Sam

169
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,943
And here's where curiosity turned into something else

170
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,271
Although Richard has trouble saying exactly what it was

171
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,367
I think it's fair to say I began with a desire to speak with the Dead

172
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
About their lives and

173
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,183
What became of them

174
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
And so he decided to look for them

175
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,303
And it's only Richard had any experience finding

176
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
People

177
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
He did what anyone would do

178
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
I Googled them

179
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
You Google

180
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
272 people who are last

181
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
C 975 years ago

182
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,567
Yeah no I Google them

183
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
I put in

184
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,455
You know Georgetown Jesuit Plantation Slaves Louisiana

185
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
And I found them

186
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
He found one

187
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
On the 1st

188
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Hit

189
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,951
There were a couple paragraphs in a genealogy Journal written by a genealogist

190
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,975
In Washington

191
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
State

192
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,047
Her name was Patricia Bayonne John

193
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
Patricia was from Louisiana

194
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
And she traced her family roots

195
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Back from Louisiana

196
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,215
Back to Maryland

197
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,263
And then back to Georgetown

198
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:19,871
And in her post was one of the names Richard had seen in the Georgetown archives

199
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
A man named Nate

200
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,783
So Richard gets in touch with Patricia and she helps him find another genealogy

201
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,063
Down in Louisiana

202
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Richard calls her and he asked

203
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
Do you think we could find out what happened to be

204
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:38,047
She thought about it there's a long pause and she said yes

205
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
We could do that

206
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,655
But you said it would take a lot of time

207
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
And a lot of money

208
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
So you know it's a Boston entrepreneur I said well

209
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
How much time and how much money

210
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,895
And again there was a long pause and she said

211
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,223
You know a hundred hours at $25 an hour

212
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
I thought

213
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,367
Heck I could hide that on my credit card from my wife it'll take her 3 months to figure

214
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,671
You know where that $2,500

215
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
The genealogist gets to work

216
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,791
Tracing 272 family tree

217
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,167
And after a couple of months the name start to come until they reach from 1838

218
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
Right up until the Press

219
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,031
And Richard has a spreadsheet with a hundred and fifty people

220
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Some of them dead

221
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,591
But some of them living

222
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
While Richard sits on the name

223
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
He feels weird

224
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,247
He's an outsider he doesn't know these people

225
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,831
He's worried if he contacts them they'll wonder why he's poking around

226
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,183
But he says he did get in touch with Georgetown to tell them what he found

227
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,255
You know I got that act very polite

228
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,839
You know responses thank you very much for this information

229
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,167
And I wrote to senior Jesuit priest

230
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
I told them

231
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,007
That what we had all been told wasn't true that

232
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,615
The Georgetown slaves could be identified and their descendants were alive today

233
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,943
And was everyone like oh my God Richard you did it

234
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
No

235
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
He says Georgetown really didn't seem too interested

236
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,623
So in the meantime

237
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,927
Richard wrote to a friend at the New York time

238
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
And he said hey

239
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
I've got a story for you

240
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,095
A year ago the times ran a story about the Georgetown sale

241
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,911
And from that point on people say it was kind of a

242
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Frenzy

243
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,495
Maxine Crump was profiled in the story

244
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:27,359
And people from Marin Quincy Maxine Maxine from Maryland in the New York Times

245
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,967
And then there were phone calls and Facebook posts and local TV coverage

246
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,831
When Mom told me about frantically texting her two kids from inside the same house

247
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,879
They were upstairs she was downstairs

248
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
To tell them

249
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,487
The mystery of Mary Gwen and this big family had finally been solved

250
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,839
So now people from Aaron gwin understood where they

251
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
And for some of them there was relief in that

252
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
And there was Pride

253
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
But the answer to this mystery

254
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Was terrible

255
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,127
Maxine can't stop thinking about what the journey from Maryland to Louisiana must have been like

256
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,663
When they're

257
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,967
All loaded on this boat it wasn't like

258
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,831
Taking a tour anything when you get a ticket you know where you going

259
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
They didn't know where they were going

260
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
And I just

261
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,463
Can imagine how frightened the children

262
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
Must have been

263
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:21,375
And she can't stop thinking about how we tell ourselves that slavery so far gone

264
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,447
Mixing to you know how many children Cornelius had

265
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
I think six

266
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,311
Do you know if any of them were born

267
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
In slavery

268
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Yes

269
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
Austin was 10th at the end of slavery

270
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
And Austin was

271
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
Your great-grandfather

272
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Yes

273
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:42,623
My grandmother's father it is not far away it is not far away

274
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,975
I spoke to older people in Maryland who remember picking cotton as children

275
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
For a few dollars a week

276
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,095
A lot of people in Maryland when are doing just fine

277
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,655
But there are also some very

278
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Very poor

279
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
1 and 3 live below the poverty line

280
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,311
You drive around and you see lovely brick houses

281
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,127
And you also see really beat up shotgun

282
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
After the New York Times story ran Richard says

283
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,831
Georgetown suddenly became deeply interested in The Descendants

284
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,927
And now that working group on slavery has another task

285
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
Figure out what we should do about the

286
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
What if anything

287
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Do we owe them

288
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,863
Maxine and Richard meanwhile had become friends

289
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
Emily Hayden ID

290
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
They wrote an op-ed in the Washington

291
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
Timmy said how about

292
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:35,103
How did anyone who is descended from one of the slaves gets Legacy status if they apply to Georgia

293
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,223
No Legacy status is not a guarantee that you get into George

294
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
It's a boot

295
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,831
Say your application is just as good as another student

296
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,647
But your parents are your family went to Georgetown

297
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Won't you get a boost

298
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,279
And if your family has donated to the alumni fund every year that's a bigger booty

299
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
Georgetown's working group was deliberating on all of this

300
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,519
Stand in the fall of 2016 Georgetown President John digioia stood in front of a formal group of students and

301
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
Professors

302
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Descendants

303
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
And he said

304
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
Georgetown had decided

305
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,407
How it would start to atone

306
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Do you have a list

307
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:15,295
The report makes several recommendations that addresses this responsibility

308
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
To acknowledge

309
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Our history

310
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
And to be honest

311
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:23,231
At first it kind of seemed like Georgetown was a toning

312
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Two Georges

313
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:29,119
It was real stuff that your joy was talking about but it was stuff at Georgetown

314
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
On campus

315
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,959
Two buildings on campus would be renamed

316
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
One of them for Isaac Hawkins

317
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
It's one of the enslaved men

318
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,359
Georgetown would strengthen support of its Library

319
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
And establish a center focused on racial

320
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Will Justice

321
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
And create a memorial

322
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
And then president Gioia said something in a way that was so low-key that when I was watching the video at first

323
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
I didn't catch it

324
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
And some people who were there that day told me

325
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
At first they didn't catch it either

326
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,119
Regarding opportunity and access the working group recommends quote

327
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
Descendants of those owned by the Maryland province

328
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
Receiving advantage

329
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
In the admissions Pro

330
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,871
Okay that there was a lot like Maxine and Richard suggestion

331
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
Descendants kitten advantage

332
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
It's a little boost when they apply

333
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:20,063
Did Ulysses you know we do that with other students so we will provide

334
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Same

335
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
Care and respect

336
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
The Descendants

337
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,023
When he got done speaking president digioia took questions from the audience

338
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
And there was this

339
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
1 Berry

340
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,607
Telling moment

341
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
German right behind you

342
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
Please introduce yourself

343
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
May I please join you

344
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
Sure

345
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
He's an older guy

346
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,871
He's bald he's got glasses and a red tie

347
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,431
He goes up and he stands beside to Gioia

348
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
Uncrate

349
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
My name is Joe Stewart and I'm a descender

350
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
Of the 272

351
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
And

352
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:00,255
He's holding a piece of paper but he hasn't read from it

353
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
He says

354
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,583
We want to collaborate with Georgetown

355
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
But this working group

356
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
It didn't include any of us

357
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
I need to send it

358
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,007
Pandan sold to date

359
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,823
We have not had the privilege

360
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,663
A being a part of the Georgetown University

361
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,991
The family and working with the working group

362
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:27,647
Nobody is hurt you got to hear from us if reconciliacion is going to take place as it is

363
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
It has to

364
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,535
It needs to start at home and you don't start reconciling by alienate

365
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
That was last

366
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,887
Fall but I heard the same thing from a lot of

367
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Descendants

368
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,471
They just didn't feel listened to

369
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
I met some of them still don't

370
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:49,407
Georgetown had taken a concrete step for them with this preferential admission status yes

371
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,455
But who all is going to benefit

372
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,551
I actually found a handful of descendants who are applying to George

373
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,367
Remember their descendants all over the country

374
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,183
I talked to a brother and sister from New Orleans

375
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
Who I guess

376
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,743
We'll probably get in

377
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
They come from a well-heeled family

378
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
Are both very good students

379
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
But the further you get from City

380
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
The deeper you get into the car

381
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
The closer you get to Marin Quinn

382
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,519
The harder it becomes

383
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Define Denny

384
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,127
And then on my second to last day in town

385
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,175
I went to visit one of the older dissent

386
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Phyllis

387
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:30,111
I pulled up to her house and she invited me and there was a teenage girl

388
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:36,511
Girl sitting in an armchair looking kind of bored

389
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Talk about Georgetown

390
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Sheep

391
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,607
Booted out of that chair and she said

392
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
I can go to that college

393
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:46,495
Lanisha Howard is Miss memes granddaughter

394
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
She's 17 she's a High School junior

395
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:54,431
She's tall and lean she's got a goofy smile and the same brown eyes you see all over Marin

396
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,783
She's going to school in Baton Rouge this year to get a break from small-town life

397
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,367
About a month ago she bumped into her favorite teacher in the hallway

398
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
Chino

399
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,951
Cuz I told him last year did I was from America

400
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
When he was like all married when

401
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
Mosquito town like yeah

402
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,607
He was like oh so you know

403
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Georgetown

404
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,215
They're doing something about descendants of slaves

405
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:18,751
Sunlight

406
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
Least interesting so you

407
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,359
Tell me more about he was like I'm going to get the paper

408
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
So he win the class when we got the paper

409
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
He gave it to me

410
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,271
He read it to me and he was like you should look into this yourself

411
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
It take it to your grandma

412
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,903
Lanisha has always had plans that don't include Louisiana

413
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,207
She's just never known what to do about them

414
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,839
And now here's a teacher telling her about preferential admissions to Georgetown University

415
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,423
And ever since then she's been imagining herself on that camp

416
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,727
What do you picture it being like

417
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Well I

418
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,311
I seen

419
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
You know

420
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,383
ICB

421
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,175
She's big and beautiful

422
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
You know

423
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
People walking around

424
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,807
Acting like mature people

425
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
You know

426
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
And it's quiet

427
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
The wind blowing

428
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Is it beautiful

429
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
She's even thought about that

430
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
Coming from Aaron gwin

431
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,119
Fitting into Georgetown might not be that easy

432
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
I will feel

433
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Like

434
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
The outlier on a

435
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Reply

436
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
Grow

437
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
Like the outlier on a graph

438
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
Is that a math term

439
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,967
Yes it is like you have a bunch of data

440
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
And you have

441
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,527
All of them

442
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:39,135
The data on a Lenny's all-in-one space and then they got these feelings out

443
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
So there are outliers

444
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
You think you'd probably be a bit of an outsider

445
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Yes ma'am

446
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,583
That's not an easy thing to be when you're 17 already

447
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
I know

448
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,143
But I mean

449
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
If I want Gradle I want to push through it

450
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Not think about it

451
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,383
So ask Lanisha if I can see her report card and she said yeah

452
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,455
First we have homeroom literacy 3

453
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
Well that's for the juniors

454
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
Destenee

455
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,343
Act English is a

456
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
English is an a

457
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
This is Spanish 2

458
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
I have a

459
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
And I understand

460
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
Spell algebra 2 is Abby

461
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
Pay English trees in a

462
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
Chemistry a

463
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
Anion chemistry

464
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
No way that's a d

465
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
Chemistry zaddy Okay so

466
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
Some really good grades in there some A's

467
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
Some bees

468
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,359
And then he'll need

469
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:36,223
Toodie's all right so let's talk a little bit about you you're doing the face to do in the face

470
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
What's up face

471
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
The D's I

472
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,647
The DC says are just not her best subjects

473
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
But she says very earnestly

474
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,999
If she gets into Georgetown she'll just

475
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
Be better

476
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
And she'll do better

477
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,351
Any supplies

478
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
She might get in

479
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,447
But if she's like most applicants she will not

480
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,031
Georgetown is one of the most competitive schools in the country

481
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,335
And this preferential admission status

482
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
However it's going to be defined

483
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,919
It is not a free pass

484
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,503
So georgetown's offer me be useful to some descendants

485
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,783
Yes absolutely

486
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:15,391
But it is not useful to those people who are most likely to need help

487
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,208
I asked father Matthew Carnes about

488
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,536
He's a professor at Georgetown and he was on the working group

489
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,608
I told him about Lanisha and he was sympathetic

490
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,752
We're very aware of how vast The Divide is 1 students that have access to the kinds of

491
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,848
Medications that will prepare them to Camden to Georgetown a really Thrive here because

492
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,736
One of our priorities as we want students who can come here and thrives they can really come and do their absolute best were

493
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,552
And be ready to arm to be in the space

494
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
Georgetown keep saying

495
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
Let us do what we do best

496
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,928
Let us educate

497
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,768
Of course there is another thing that Georgetown could offer

498
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Money

499
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
Some of the descendants of brought this up

500
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,424
Richard Sweeney has stayed very involved with the community of

501
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
Descendants

502
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
And he also talks to people at Georgetown

503
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:05,568
And he says there are people on both sides who say

504
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
This should not

505
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Become about money

506
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Here's what he thinks

507
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,224
You know when people say

508
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
It's not about the money

509
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,296
You know one thing for sure

510
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
It's only about

511
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
This story has only ever been

512
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
About the money

513
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,672
And that part is true

514
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,720
This started with money

515
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,768
$115,000

516
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
For 272 lives

517
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
And what if it ended with my

518
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,192
If an institution or a person

519
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,800
Reason a country wrote a check to somehow atone for slavery and for its Legacy

520
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,592
What would that cost

521
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,128
And who would get paid

522
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
And what everyone except

523
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,528
Deborah Tilson the woman who met her cousin in the parking lot in Maryland

524
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
I talked to her about this

525
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,368
There is a sense of pride

526
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,648
This is Luke

527
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
If you wronged me

528
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,512
I shouldn't have to come to you and ask you

529
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
You know

530
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,864
You call me I'm Tim's hey look you know hey I got something for you
