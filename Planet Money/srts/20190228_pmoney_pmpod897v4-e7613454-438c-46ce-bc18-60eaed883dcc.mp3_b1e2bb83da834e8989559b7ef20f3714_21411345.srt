12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,624
It's in Treme a historically black neighborhood that is

Fresh paint

20
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,680

00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,904
For the festivities that's to come

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,696

She knows what she wants and she makes it happen

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,448
Even as a kid

35
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,520
When she was 7 years old sheet set up a table in front yard

36
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,872
I had a wet Norman's people call a huckabuck business

00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
Which is Frozen car

38
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,224
With different varieties of flavors

39
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,784
They're like these homemade popsicles in plastic cup

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,344
She ran a talent show in her family's garage

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Artemisia

42
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
She got older it was time for a real job

43
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
I don't have a degree I didn't

44
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
Complete College

45
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
Sounds like a lot of New Orleans

46
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
She wanted hospitality

47
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
Got a job at a Downtown hotel

48
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
You work your way up from

49
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
Phones

50
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Cleaning lady

51
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,496
To manager and I can be pretty nasty work

52
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
Especially around Mardi Gras time

53
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
Housekeepers deal with a lot we have those

54
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Famous

55
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
Hurricane drink

56
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
And we have a hand grenade drink stat

57
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,296
People tend to become projectile

58
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,088
Mardi Gras Hotel hazard

59
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,136
It's a she figures

60
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,952
Mardi Gras Hotel Hazard pay for the house key

61
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Only seems fair

62
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,536
Soap she goes to the manager with her pet

63
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,840
This is beyond just general

64
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:18,240
Cleaning this is bio you know bodily fluids that's coming up and he was

65
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
Play Charlie we don't offer anything like that there

66
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,616
And I'm like okay well you should

67
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272
She turns and walks away and her tidy work uniform shaking her head and an idea strikes her that's when

68
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
Bed and breakfast

69
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
Came to mind

70
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,256
So she quits her job at the hotel and she buys the gutted out house right next door to her for $15,000

71
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
Then she spent the next couple of years

72
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,096
Working to fix the place up

73
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,120
Drywall

74
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Plumbing

75
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
Staircase

76
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,472
Painting and she did most of it with their own hands

77
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Then Katrina

78
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Ruthless

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
She had to fix the place up all over again

80
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Are opening a real bed and breakfasts

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
It just still feels far away

82
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
Then one day on the radio

83
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:04,832
I heard about the Airbnb they had did a newscast and Mardi Gras was coming up

84
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
Airbnb

85
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
The website the company was coming to Newark

86
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:12,256
And it would be easy she wouldn't need a front desk her to cook breakfast for everyone

87
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,608
Just choose an enticing named and listed on the website historic

88
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
Three-bedroom two-story modern home all the things

89
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,240
We didn't have a lot of furniture is good

90
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,056
We had the boxspring and mattress

91
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
And the property was nice and clean

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,176
And she doubled her income nearly overnight

93
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,504
She went from making about two grand a month at the hotel to making

94
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
For on a Goodman

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Changing her life

96
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,856
This is the kind of thing that

97
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,416
Politicians and Community groups at everybody

98
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Wants to see happen

99
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
Somebody from

100
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
The city

101
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
Making good

102
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
Reinvesting in the neighborhood

103
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,560
Building

104
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:51,680
Being a African-American woman purchasing a property here in Treme

105
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,336
Which is the first African-American Community here in the city that's historical

106
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
All by myself

107
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
And I'm excited about it and I want to keep it

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
So

109
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
Why would her native City

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
Shut her business

111
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
Down

112
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
Hello and welcome to Planet Money

113
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
Reporter with wwno in New Orleans today on the show how New Orleans set out to help residents like Charlene build

114
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
Caldwell and it backfired

115
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,215
Airbnb let Charlene go from hotel worker to Hotel owner

116
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,055
But then everyone else got in on it to even big companies

117
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
So many homes

118
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
Turned into hotels

119
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,895
That whole block

120
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Whole neighborhood

121
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Change

122
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,063
They got fixed up and they look prettier but they lost the thing that makes New Orleans New Orleans

123
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
It's residence

124
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,415
Now Charlene is caught in the middle of the city big

125
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,255
Let it more money and become less interesting

126
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,095
Oriental residence like Charlene to shut down their businesses

127

To understand why the city would shut Sharlene.

137
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
You just need to take a walk down the street

138
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
To the other side

139
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
Mardi Gras tradition

140
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,591
So imagine this it's Mardi Gras morning it's super early like 5 a.m.

141
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,943
And this tradition happens every year some say it's been going on for like 200 years

142
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,807
Off in the distance you hear it clanging bells and rattles and hand drums this

143
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
Walking parade

144
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,159
Waking up the whole neighborhood

145
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
And then you will see the skeletons walking

146
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Industry

147
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
Yelling out

148
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
Bunganut sidebone game

149
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,935
We are going to know

150
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
Golden Ball Game

151
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,287
Will you come to remind you

152
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
Before you die

153
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
This is your heart is real

154
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
He is part of this calling

155
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,735
And I'm Mardi Gras morning he and his friends dress up as

156
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
Spirit they wear these

157
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Bulbous

158
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,063
Skeleton mask

159
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
Where stilson

160
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,159
Horns on their head and they carry these big

161
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,183
Cow bones

162
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Really freaky

163
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
And it's super loud

164
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
And the point

165
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
Is too scared

166
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
On Mardi Gras day this day of x

167
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
Just to scare them straight

168
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
And be like

169
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
I've just wondering

170
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,727
Not 10 that's how deliver

171
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,055
And people know this tradition they know with the spirits mean

172
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,615
You're supposed to play along and be afraid

173
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
The ultimate people

174
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Big new

175
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,991
I mean we have grown people that with

176
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
Take flight when they see the bone game

177
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,903
But in the last couple of years the neighborhood has changed

178
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,975
There aren't as many black families as there used to be

179
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
Dohar finds more up smiling as he would say Anglo-Saxon

180
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,863
So we coming down the street

181
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
And you might see them

182
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,935
You know what their robes on

183
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
Peeping out the door

184
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
They drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette

185
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,847
And waving at you you know they don't really know

186
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
It's a little sad

187
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,479
He misses when people used to freak out and run away from a cup of coffee

188
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
They don't understand

189
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
They don't know anything about

190
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:19,807
Autobahn game

191
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,855
But the same Canadian

192
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
Swiss visitors

193
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
Visitors are Charlene's customers

194
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
It used to be in the city with j

195
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
This neighborhood over here

196
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
It's for Tori

197
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
It's a commercial

198
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,887
And that one over there it's residential no hotels

199
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
But Airbnb has blurred the law

200
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,775
Each new home that switches from home to hotel

201
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,847
Takes away a little bit from the old field

202
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,639
Zohar we take from the culture

203
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
But Charlene says

204
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
She's part of the culture too isn't she

205
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
And she sharing that culture with your guess

206
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,111
For them to become a part of the culture as well

207
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,159
Like the time she had a Halloween party

208
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
New Orleans

209
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
Turn Style which means she had to warn her gas it was

210
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
And it would be a little loud

211
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
We the owners would be loud

212
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,167
So it would be great if they could come and take part in it

213
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:13,567
So they came and they dressed up in their costume my husband was dressed as Spider-Man

214
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,175
I dressed up as a witch had my little broom and and

215
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
The guest came and she dressed as us

216
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,063
Seamoth lady in like this really flowy dress

217
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
We had a great time

218
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
We had a great time

219
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
Having touristy next door might change the neighborhood

220
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
But she sees it as a compromise worth

221
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
Some of them have even become a friend

222
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,607
Her first guess still text her every Fat Tuesday

223
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:41,983
We miss you guys we know what you guys are doing we are working on on this Tuesday 1

224
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,543
We know that you guys are partying out nor

225
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,871
So it just really delighted my heart

226
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,431
Separate like 5 or 6 years or so

227
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
Charlene is running this Airbnb

228
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,759
It's her business

229
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
She's hosting people from all over the world

230
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
And she's making some pretty significant income

231
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
With no problem

232
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:05,279
So she's pretty surprised to be driving along one day and she hears on the radio that the cities concerned about all these

233
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
Coffee drinking

234
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Taurus

235
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,911
And there may be going to start cracking down and making it harder for them to come

236
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
This was about three years

237
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Get up until then

238
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
Anybody could rent out anything on there be

239
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
It was technically illegal

240
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
But there was

241
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,175
No enforcement at all so it was a free-for-all no limits on

242
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:25,759
How many places you can rent out where you could rent out a house on there

243
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
And this radio spot comes

244
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,927
At the same time that cities around the country are crafting strict regulations about

245
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
New York and Seattle in Santa Monica

246
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
They're all doing something like that

247
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
The regulations

248
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Are coming down

249
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:45,983
Some like okay well this this shouldn't be a problem you're not I think everything should have some regulations

250
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,543
Charlene Drive downtown to the meeting

251
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
Pinterest and goes on for hours

252
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,687
And that's when I realized this this is a big deal here

253
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,991
This is this is affecting

254
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
A lot of people in different ways

255
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
It was people down speaking the neighborhoods have changed there's no children in the neighborhood is running up and down

256
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:12,351
It's not the old lady that normally would be sitting on the stoop doing the lookout for the community

257
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,167
And after all that when the council votes they say

258
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,727
We're cool with Airbnb

259
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,287
And Council passes some rules that are

260
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,847
Maybe not quite a rubber stamp

261
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:27,455
But they essentially said Charlene you can keep doing your thing you can keep building your business

262
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,295
I have to do now is register for a small fee and pay a tiny little

263
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
Charlene

264
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,415
She keeps fixing up a place with nice furniture and less curtains

265
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
It keeps that paint job

266
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
The freshest on the Block

267
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,255
These new regulation

268
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,839
They opened up a boom. For people to buy places

269
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
The fix up and rent them out to

270
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
Having some

271
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
Light regular

272
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:53,567
Is like an even bigger invitation to invest and if there were none at all because it's

273
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,591
The city saying

274
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
We are behind this we made these rules

275
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Clarity

276
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Do your thing

277
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
Whole block start

278
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Change it

279
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,575
It's easy to see when we walk from Charlene's block towards the

280
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,647
First people on porches

281
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,743
Is one cheat on a skateboards mother coming home from school and like a grandma hanging out

282
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
It's a little baby

283
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
And then

284
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,839
On-the-scene Avenue just a few blocks

285
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
The neighborhood starts

286
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
More and more of the homes that we

287
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,471
Pass has he

288
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,263
Digital keypad locks

289
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,335
Instead of regular key lock so people can check themselves in

290
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,919
510 minutes towards the French Quarter

291
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Call Charlene

292
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
And the

293
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,527
Woman at the coffee shop just pointed out

294
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,831
Basically this whole block is Airbnb

295
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:40,927
And it feels kind of like wearing a hotel it's weirdly quiet for a week

296
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Dino cars

297
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
People so we look up some of these addresses on a City website

298
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,887
These four homes are owned by one dude who owns upwards of

299
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,191
You know 20 Properties or more in the city

300
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
And he hires a bunch of people

301
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
2

302
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
You know

303
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
Clean the oven

304
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,383
You know check people in and check people out like this is his hotel

305
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,175
Annie's

306
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,039
He's running he's running a for home Hotel on the same street that it's just

307
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Gianna Venice Hotel

308
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Though not to the people

309
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,207
Richard Kendricks lived here for half his life and he's 83

310
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,767
Everything everything in the back and B&B

311
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Everyday

312
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,119
He says the whole neighborhood needs to be filled with family

313
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
It's mostly black families with children

314
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
Predominantly

315
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
Temperature around here

316
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,799
Cuz you don't forget your signature and around your neck

317
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,871
They said he only knows two of his neighbors now

318
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Lots of lox

319
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,455
Have been bought out by big out of town and

320
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
There's this

321
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,575
One company from San Francisco that bought like 200 houses

322
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
And then hired managers

323
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Including staff

324
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,647
Running it like

325
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Giant hotel

326
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,279
And making it more expensive for locals to buy houses

327
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,655
To live in Kristen Gilson Palmer was running a nonprofit for low-income homeowners at the time of this

328
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
I just started getting calls about Airbnb

329
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
What we started seeing

330
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,823
During that period was that

331
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,895
Out-of-town investors would come in

332
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,431
Mumbai property

333
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Edumatch inflated

334
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,527
Cost right because they're looking at purchasing a house

335
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,087
Different than the way home owner purchases a house right

336
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:13,855
Soap shoes

337
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
Ran for city council partly on a platform to

338
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,207
Crackdown on Airbnb

339
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
But she's not mad about Charlene

340
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,047
But she wants to get rid of these

341
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:22,815
Is bigamist

342
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
And it worked she wins

343
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,911
The new slate of City councilors takes over

344
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,215
And they're looking to rein in Airbnb

345
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
So

346
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,543
The city does it all over again

347
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,335
Another big meeting

348
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Tegan you were there

349
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,783
You are good morning and thank everybody for being here yeah there was a huge turnout there were people pissed off on

350
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
Both sides for and against an

351
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
A long line for these little yellow cards that you have

352
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,439
To fill out in order to get up to the podium

353
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
And speaking

354
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
The chambers were overflowing

355
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,511
It was

356
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Tents heated

357
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
Suzhou they're running charities

358
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,247
Even the complainers at a city meeting in New Orleans have

359
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
And then it's Charlene's kind

360
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,135
My name is Charlene Griffin I live at the ursulines Avenue

361
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
I've been leaving here 50 years

362
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,279
And I'm here today is just a people need to wake up

363
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
There's so much blood

364
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,935
Short term rental has really Revitalize a lot of communities

365
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
And when the city council

366
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,311
Takes all of this in and votes on the new rules they totally flip

367
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
They go from about as

368
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:44,223
Lucent permissive as they can be to some of the strictest in the country it's almost a ban

369
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
And this happened last fall

370
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,319
The city put the rules into place but they also say

371
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
We're going to study

372
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,903
We're going to see how everything is working out

373
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
And essentially

374
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
They're saying we might

375
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,279
Change everything all over again this coming spring

376
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:01,375
But for now councilwoman Palmer has what she wants

377
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
The only short-term rentals that are allowed

378
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,495
Are the people who actually live on the property they're renting

379
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
An extra bedroom

380
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
So basically

381
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,895
You will not have whole house short-term rentals you can only have a short term rental

382
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,687
If you live in the property

383
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,247
The city also says that certain areas

384
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
They are goes on

385
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,319
Their commercial and they're fine for your

386
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
But other

387
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Places residential neighbor

388
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Like where Charlene live

389
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
Only very few situations

390
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Are now allowed

391
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,303
So your favorite room yeah that's okay

392
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
Even if you have an extra apartment that is

393
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,655
Attached to your house where you live

394
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
That's also okay

395
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
But if you don't live in the house

396
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Mike if you are a

397
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
A big out-of-town investor with

398
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
4 homes on one block

399
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
That's not okay.

400
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Or

401
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
If you are a local

402
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
Hometown business

403
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
You bought and fixed up

404
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
The house next door

405
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,807
It is also not a

406
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
And that shuts a lot of

407
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
People down

408
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,231
Airbnb the company says they've never seen this

409
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
Before Stephen Shepherd

410
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
Says also not such a great idea

411
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,887
Is an economist at Williams College in Williamstown Massachusetts

412
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,935
And he's been studying Airbnb for the past

413
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
The problem about

414
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,055
Mucking around with these sorts of regulations is

415
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,127
You could if you don't balance it and

416
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
Get the balance right

417
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
You could end up

418
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,527
You know trying to keep housing affordable by

419
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
Choking off investment

420
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
One thing that Economist do know about short-term

421
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,439
Is that they increase overall profit

422
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,023
So Shepherd he did a study using data from you

423
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
He found that

424
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,095
When you double the number of Airbnb

425
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:40,191
It drives up property values by 6 to 13%

426
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
Which makes it more worthwhile to

427
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:46,079
Renovate brings in more money to the community which seems like you're

428
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,383
Should be a good thing for a place like New Orleans where

429
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
Mayors and government officials have just

430
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,711
Struggled so much

431
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,735
Since hurricane Katrina

432
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,527
Define anyway

433
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
To get people to

434
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,367
To fix up neighborhoods in fix the blade housing so

435
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Airbnb seems to be

436
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Doing that

437
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
How is it not a solute

438
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,535
Shepherd says there are of course winners and losers

439
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,863
And you have to weigh them against each other which he did you're saying

440
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,167
You can divide a city into two groups

441
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,959
People who use Airbnb

442
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
Add an event

443
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,031
Out there house or just stay there as tourists

444
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,359
And everybody else who doesn't use Airbnb and you're saying

445
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
The users they win

446
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
And the people who don't

447
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
Use Airbnb they lose

448
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,575
I think that's a fair characterization of my viewpoint yes

449
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:33,183
So I think it makes people who are seeking housing in the city

450
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,487
I bet you are not

451
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
Making their homes available

452
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
Condo short term rental market

453
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
I think it makes them

454
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,727
I worse off Airbnb is bringing more money into these neighborhood

455
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,567
But the other side of rising property values is

456
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
Rising rents

457
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
And so

458
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
It's pushing

459
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
People out

460
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
And their weirdness with

461
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
To the cities

462
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
Steppin in it

463
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,831
But these new regulations for not just kicking out the baked salmon

464
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:05,183
Francisco investors and getting rid of those blocks that have been turned into hotels

465
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
They're shutting people like Charlene down to

466
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
What the city is trying to do is balance distraida

467
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,583
Of prosperity

468
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
With preserving

469
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Culture

470
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
In the city

471
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
Is making a bargain

472
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
It's it's

473
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,007
Just decided on the compromise

474
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,799
We want to stay

475
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
More of the same

476
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
More weird

477
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,871
Even if it means

478
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
We stay a little bit poor

479
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
And Charlene

480
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
Definitely a little poor lately

481
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
I'm trying to

482
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Packages say

483
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
Steel claw my way

484
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
Call my way

485
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,463
Hold on hold on hold on and

486
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,047
Try to make some fun and because I don't want to dismantle

487
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
This whole house

488
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,911
When Charlene walks into an empty Airbnb now its

489
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Christine

490
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
But like a museum

491
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
Empty

492
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
The staircase Cherry varnish

493
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
Gathering dust

494
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
The beds are perfectly made up for guests

495
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
With matching sheet

496
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
Only now

497
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
Wanda plaza

498
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
Sick rap

499
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,039
Normally wouldn't have this plastic on it it would

500
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,623
You know just be welcoming for guests to come in and

501
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
Take their leisure

502
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
But

503
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,023
That's what you do when a place is Sitting In Limbo

504
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,351
She's hoping that when the city council finishes up that studying

505
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,167
Spring that they'll make an exception for people like

506
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
Maybe grandmother her in

507
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
I'm still mine Bible baby cuz it's

508
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,079
Did flip flop made so much flip flop

509
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,127
Flip flop back and forth

510
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,431
Yes no yes no

511
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
Yes or no

512
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
But

513
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,551
No but it could be a yes

514
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,599
For now the money's not

515
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
But she's got a new gig

516
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,975
I spent a half of my day out ubering

517
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,303
Because that's what I'm doing to try to

518
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,375
Hold his property out into the city made

519
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,679
Make a decision of what they what they going to do

520
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,495
She says she likes getting to see all the houses around

521
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
Especially the ones that have been fixed up in

522
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
General Decker

523
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359

Airbnb owner

525
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Even if

526
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:05,503
The houses are empty now with no tourists or locals

527
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,631

Thanks for listening

551
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
See we also have to

552
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
Defend ourselves

553
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
You know you never know when

554
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
Someone

555
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Get drunk

556
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,640
And and you don't want to run up on you

557
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
So we have to have

558
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
