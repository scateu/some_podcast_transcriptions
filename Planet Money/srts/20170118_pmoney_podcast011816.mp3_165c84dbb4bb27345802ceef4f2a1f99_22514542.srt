1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,048
There is this

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:02,816
Race

3
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,352
Going on right now in Washington

4
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,144
To DC this week it's a sort of

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,912
Sprint

6
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:09,728
And the finish line is Friday at noon

7
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,496
Inauguration

8
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:14,080
The desperate Runners are all the people who work for borracho

9
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,128
Obama all the people in his administration

10
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,432
And they were trying in these last days

11
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:22,272
Put in place everything they can to ensure the legacy of this president

12
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,808
Before the next one comes in

13
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,112
They tried to match up some last-minute wins

14
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:30,208
The Obama Administration is creating new national monuments in Oregon

15
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,744
California Utah

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,120
Alabama Bunch places speed band offshore drilling in Parts of Alaska for trying to protect funding for play

17
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
Planned Parenthood

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
They released a bunch of prisoners from

19
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:45,056
Guantanamo a picture of going to the rulebook for the president and trying to figure out if there's anything else they can

20
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,360
Possibly do with the powers of the presidency

21
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
Before Donald Trump is smart

22
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,688
Andeavor your building is legacy

23
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:55,808
You can see the Republican Congress already trying to remove the bricks to undo everything they can

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,344
Fast of the Obama people

25
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:02,464
And it's amazing moment to see because a lot of this drama this race

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,488
It comes down to things

27
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,048
We don't usually think about when we think about government

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,096
Because it's not about passing laws

29
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,632
Signing bills or statue

30
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
It's rules

31
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Rules

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
Thousands of pages of rules

33
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,264
The take vague laws and make them

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,032
A reality

35
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,104
The political balance in Washington DC may have shifted

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,688
But the real power is in the hands of the people who write the rules

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,248
And the rules to get put in place this week

38
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,784
May stick around forever

39
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
Hello and welcome

40
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
Planet Money I'm Stacey Vanek Smith and Robert Smith today on the show we will take a single last minute Obama

41
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,048
May very well be

42
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,144
The very last thing that President Obama does in office

43
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:46,240
This rule goes into effect the day before Trump is not great on Thursday

44
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
And we will show you how this rule came about and how it works

45
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,200
It's a rule that could help clean up polluted streams and lakes and could also cost big companies a lot

46
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
Of money it's a rule that could change this country

47
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,088
And it all depends on whether or not Congress could dismantle it

48
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
And that

49
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Is a question of timing

50

61
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
Final Obama screw you to Republican

62
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
In fact it has been in the works

63
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
For a long time

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
A very long time

65
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
Long before Obama even got his law degree

66
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
This story started

67
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
With a coal miner

68
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:02,528
Before we get started could I get you to introduce yourself with a Hello my name is

69
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
My name is

70
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
Chuck Nelson

71
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
A retired coal miner

72
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,792
About 30 years at working Underground

73
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,864
I'm a fourth-generation coal miner so

74
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,960
Father grandfather great grandfather we all work in the mines

75
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
Habanero

76
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,640
1980s check had a job loading coal onto a conveyor

77
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,712
He was living in Sylvester West Virginia with his wife into

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
And he was used to dirt and cold us

79
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Down in the mine

80
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,880
But then a coal processing plant was built right near his home

81
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
We start eating a lot of cold

82
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,208
Hummingbird bath

83
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
I may not go to work and come home at night

84
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,328
Tonight will be a half inch Eco test

85
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,144
Everything in the house what is coldest look like

86
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
It's just black powder

87
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
Sis light on your tables on

88
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
Ford

89
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
Beyond

90
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,176
It would even get in the refrigerator that's for this stuff again

91
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,296
Chuck's kids couldn't swim in their pool because there was this thick black skin on the water all the time

92
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,112
Text wife started having really bad asthma problems

93
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
Complain to the coal company

94
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
End

95
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
They ignored her

96
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,744
And this made Chuck angry

97
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,559
Sauschuck started to talk to Environmental Group

98
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
The advocacy group

99
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,215
On his days off at the coal mine he would gather a little group of locals together get into his Mitsubishi Eclipse

100
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
And drive for 5 hours to washing

101
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
And there he would meet with anyone who would hear

102
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
He would talk about the

103
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,431
Pollution he was seeing in his community and health problems

104
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
People were having

105
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
He thought the coal companies were to blame

106
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,319
Which did not play too well with some of his fellow coal miner

107
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,159
They would tell him the coal industry is struggling as it is

108
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,975
If you go and advocate for a bunch of new regulations

109
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,999
We're going to lose our jobs

110
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
They threatened it

111
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,863
Decorating is a threat this is Douglas down in Minecraft

112
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Killer

113
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,703
But check kept making car trips to Washington

114
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,591
2dc specifically protected trucks refrigerator and his swimming pool from coal dust

115
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,663
What environmental experts pointed out that there might be another way to

116
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
To help his family

117
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,063
It was a law already on the books called the surface mining control and Reclamation Act

118
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Who's passed in 1977

119
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,415
And it basically said that mining companies should try

120
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,511
Try really really hard not to kill Fish and Wildlife

121
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
Okay so here is the actual language

122
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,423
It says that Coal Company should not cause quote material damage to the environment

123
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
To the extent that it is

124
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,239
Technologically and economic

125
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
Whatever that mean

126
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,639
Technologically economically feasible could mean anything

127
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:42,527
Marvin sister supposed to be there supposed to be really brought it's part of what helps get Congress to vote for

128
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,367
And after Congress vote for the lawn after they go home on

129
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Ktuner back to the

130
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
District whatever's there doing

131
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,231
That is when somebody needs to write

132
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
The specific rules

133
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,095
What the law should look like on the ground who it applies to

134
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
Under what circumstances can look

135
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
Really different

136
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Depending on the

137
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Specific

138
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Rules

139
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
So

140
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
Bureaucrats lawyer scientist expert

141
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,687
They sit down in room after room after room and figure out okay so

142
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,503
What did Congress mean when they said material damage

143
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,575
What did they want to happen when they said

144
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Technological and economic

145
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,951
In the case of the surface mining control and Rec

146
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Formation Act of

147
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
1077

148
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,815
Chuck and other environmental Advocates felt like the rules

149
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
They said coal companies are still open

150
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
People are have

151
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
Health problems the streams are full of heavy metals

152
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,751
Refrigerators are still full

153
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
Full of coal dust

154
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
This law has no teeth

155
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
So they started pushing for a real check

156
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,175
Same 1977 Loft restrictors

157
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Enforcement

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,503
And when Obama took office the new rule makers

159
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
She put in charge of

160
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
Mining regulations said

161
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Okay

162
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Let's do this

163
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
1

164
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,927
Small problem writing this rule

165
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
Come to be known as the stream protection rule

166
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Was not going to be in

167
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Easy thing

168
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,095
It would take thousands of pages of writing callus hearings

169
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,191
And all this time Chuck and the other activists is community woodpile to the Mitsubishi

170
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,031
Drive to DC and centerpiece in Capitol Hill again and again in a

171
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
Since 2006 I might have many many trips

172
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
Washington DC

173
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Like

174
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,967
20 / 25

175
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,295
And I mean every year we used to go we would Lobby

176
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
Ariana talk

177
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
What senators

178
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
Congressman

179
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
DPI

180
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
Louis M

181
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
Ali's agency

182
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
We did that wants to every year

183
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,655
It's funny because I know I follow political news fairly closely what happens in washing

184
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
DCA what I think about

185
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,751
What really gets done there I always think about the

186
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,031
Congressional debates

187
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
C-SPAN

188
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,663
The voting passed the big signing the president does the bill in the Rose Garden

189
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,783
The woodchuck was going through was the real work the real power of Washington DC

190
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
The arguing over all the details

191
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
Actual writing

192
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:00,767
Rulemaking is a process is the most important source of law in America in a rulemaking is

193
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:07,423
That kind of activity that get you really into the guts and details of how public policies and programs work

194
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,775
Neil Kerwin is the president of American University P also wrote a book about

195
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,871
Which I'm sure drives his kids nuts right I wrote the Book of Rules

196
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
You got to clean up your room

197
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,735
He told me that are practical reasons

198
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
Why the system works

199
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
Because politicians are

200
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
Big picture

201
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,183
They passed laws that give general direction the gist of what the country

202
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,255
It would take forever to read the kind of details that

203
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,023
Rules provide

204
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,839
Rules of taking over DC for another week

205
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
And that is because

206
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
Presidents can make rules all by themselves

207
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,799
Well I mean the the one thing that rulemaking does it for the president has the ability to enact

208
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,127
Public policy without interacting with the Congress

209
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,455
Rules don't usually need to be approved by Congress Congress gets

210
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,063
The comments of the public but basically when it comes to rules what the White House says go

211
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,879
That's how President Obama accomplish a lot of

212
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
What he did the Republicans controlled Congress

213
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
But Obama controlled

214
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
The rules

215
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,303
Music Obama has kind of gone to town with the rulemaking

216
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Over the last few months

217
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,655
Since June Obama issued more than 60 rule

218
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Covering everything from

219
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,007
Drone certification to how Medicare covers

220
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
The school lunches

221
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
And of course the stream protection rule

222
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
Stream protection

223
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
Environmentalist had been working on it for

224
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
Tour years and years

225
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Years

226
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
Obama loves rules

227
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,343
Andy sympathetic environmental cause

228
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,647
This is Our Moment

229
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,487
Until they pressed finish this rule while Obama

230
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Was still print

231
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Matt Watson

232
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
An ecologist the group called Appalachian voices

233
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
Made it his mission

234
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
How many hours

235
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
Would you say you've put into the stream protection rule

236
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,263
Wow

237
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
I guess

238
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
15 years worth of hours

239
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,175
Since the early days when Chuck

240
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
The coal miner

241
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,991
Start complaining about the coldest in his house

242
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,575
The stream protection rule had balloon to 1200

243
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Pages

244
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,159
Obama's first term passed without finishing the rule

245
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,231
His second term was nearing its end and it still wasn't fitting

246
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
Nobody could tell me why it was taking so long I asked everybody this and people just get them all that is how long

247
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,215
Girls take their all these rules that you have to follow when you're making

248
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Arul there Pub

249
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,775
Amon.

250
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
You've to meet with all the

251
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Involved

252
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
Companies the miners used to go to

253
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,687
People's homes you have to take soil samples in water sample

254
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
There's just all the stuff you have to do

255
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
And then there was the whole

256
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:35,647
Political thing to like maybe Obama did not want to piss off cool States right before the election

257
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
Perhaps he just assumed that Clinton would win

258
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
She would take care of

259
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,047
Whatever the reason Obama's agencies work

260
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Really fast after Trump was elected

261
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,935
Anton December 20th when Matt Watson was visiting his brother in Calif

262
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
Aunt for the holidays

263
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,519
He woke up to see an alert on his phone

264
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
Stream protection rule was being issue

265
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
It would go into effect on January 19th

266
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,735
Literally on the last full day of Barack Obama's

267
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,855
Yokai I guess the thought was oh snap I was going to be in here

268
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,439
As well as some relief that they actually did get it done

269
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
Siri like

270
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,583
Finally after all these years I mean 15 years

271
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,959
Hazmat was reading the alert on his phone in California feeling that sense of relief

272
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,287
Members of the coal industry were also getting the news

273
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,871
Adam Eckman was at his desk in Washington DC that morning he heard

274
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
The rule was

275
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
Finalizing

276
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,735
Refreshing the department of the interior's website over and over

277
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:37,599
He's a lawyer for the national mining Association which is an advocacy group that represents mine and come

278
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:42,207
And just like the environmentalist Adam had spent years of his life

279
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
Working on this route

280
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
Thousands of his own hours on the opposite side

281
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Fighting

282
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
The stream protection rule

283
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Although

284
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
He does not like that name

285
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
That name is something of a misnomer

286
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,287
It amends or modifies 475

287
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,079
Existing rules

288
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
Within the code of federal

289
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
So to call it a single rule is startling

290
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
I just might be able to tell Adam is a lawyer by training and he has spent all these years talking to Congress and mining companies

291
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
And people who live near mining operations

292
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:16,511
And as the days were sleeping by Adam thought he had one it was too late in Obama's presidency

293
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
The end the stream protection rule

294
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Would not have

295
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
But then

296
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
At the eleventh hour

297
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
It came through

298
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,471
An atom stop this isn't right this is a rush job

299
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,031
You know the comment. On it

300
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,823
Was only 90 days

301
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,199
A 90 days may sound like a lot of time but when you're reviewing thousands of pages of material

302
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
It's not it's no time at all

303
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,063
And I thought about all of the stakeholders

304
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,903
They're affected by this it doesn't just affect mining it has effects on

305
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,231
Farmers and land users and all different kinds of people you know

306
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,815
And for the agency doesn't move forward with the rulemaking

307
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
You know just

308
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
Just a couple weeks

309
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
Before the end of administration

310
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:59,519
So yeah I mean obviously I was very disappointed to put it mildly

311
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,079
Disappointed because once a rule

312
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
John once a rule goes into effect

313
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:05,919
I'm doing it

314
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
Is also really hard

315
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:12,575
The guy who wrote the book on rules milk Irwin says it basically takes this long to eliminate a rule

316
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
As it does

317
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
To make it in the first place

318
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,695
How hard is it to undo a rule

319
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:24,095
Well I mean I think you the general consensus is that a president speaking to repeal a rule

320
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
We have to write a regulation

321
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Not to alter or eliminate

322
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,103
So you go through the same process to repeal a rule or alter rule as you do to write one in the first place

323
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
So a lot of work

324
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Blood work

325
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
Analytic time years worth of testimony

326
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
Scientific studies lobbying Congress

327
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
Securing

328
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:48,159
And Thomas is agenda instantly tied up for months

329
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,183
So rules

330
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Their power really

331
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
Is inertia

332
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Penn State football

333
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Yeah except for one thing

334
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
Congress has a secret weapon in his Bat

335
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:03,263
No countries have noticed long ago that presidents were using this rulemaking power to their advantage

336
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,799
This month in Congress Heights

337
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,103
It's when the president gets more power

338
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,687
So back in the 1990s the Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich

339
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
He was complaining about all these

340
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,551
Rules at president pass especially at the last minute

341
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,599
Gumming up the works forcing their will

342
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
And so

343
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
He pushed through a law

344
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,743
That a lot of people didn't think much about it at the time sort of

345
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Neutron Timebomb

346
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,351
It's called the Congressional review Act

347
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:33,215
And it says that any rule passed can be traced within 60 Congressional days

348
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
If

349
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
The House and Senate agreed and the president signs off on

350
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,335
The rule will vanish

351
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
It was the time it doesn't matter because of

352
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
President

353
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
Write the rule in Congress tried to overturn it

354
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,759
President can just veto that

355
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:50,879
But this comes into effect when there is a new president when a rule is passed

356
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
In the very last days

357
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
Of the president's Administration

358
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
And the stream protection rule is a perfect

359
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Target for the Congressional review Act

360
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:01,887
Chuck Nelson the guy who'd been working on the screen protection accidents

361
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
The 80s the coal miner

362
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,543
Said this was the first thing that went through his head when he watched Trump on television

363
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,591
Take the podium for his victory speech

364
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615

368
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,527
Outlet work for

369
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
United

370
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
Just go to bed with wife

371
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,879
Wiped away with a stroke of a pen

372
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
Wiped away with a stroke

373
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Japan

374
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
And wiped away for good because

375
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,047
If a rule is overturned using the Congressional review Act

376
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
A similar rule canopy

377
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,863
Be put in place

378
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Everett

379
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,983
But it's really rare of the 73,000 rules at

380
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
Have been issued since the

381
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
Congressional review Act

382
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Past

383
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
It is only been used successfully

384
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Once

385
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
On one rule

386
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
2001

387
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,967
And we're going to tell you about it briefly because

388
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
This could be the Fate

389
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Of the Stream

390
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,599
Is 1 unlucky rule was developed by OSHA

391
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,903
The occupational safety and health administration

392
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,951
And was pushed through by Bill Clinton

393
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
It was called

394
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,767
The Department of Labor organized

395
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Program

396
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,655
Yes it's exciting it had to do with ergonomics and repetitive stress injury

397
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,447
It said if multiple employees

398
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,007
Complained about ergonomic conditions in the workplace

399
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
The employer had to make a change

400
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
So

401
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
I get

402
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Carpal tunnel

403
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
Have a trackball mouse and

404
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
Wavy ergonomic keyboard

405
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
Would that have been covered

406
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
That would have been cover

407
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Okay

408
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
Stephen Cochran helped write the ergonomics rule he is a systems engineer and he spent three years writing the rule touring

409
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
Workplaces were injuries or common places

410
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,559
ACME Packing plants and talking to workers and

411
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,935
David's has the final rule with everything included was 4000 pages long

412
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,519
It was one of the last rules passed by the Clinton Administration and when George W

413
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
Bush took office

414
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Republican Congress

415
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
They went after the OSHA rule

416
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
And using the Congressional review Act

417
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
Within two months

418
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
Overturned it

419
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,503
It was very considered very effective after

420
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
I mean it occurs to me that you spent

421
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
Years

422
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,159
Getting this role together Gathering puppet

423
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Support work

424
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Companies

425
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
And all that was just sort of

426
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Undone in

427
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,095
Like 60 days 90 days

428
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Yep

429
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
Is it was

430
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,775
Looking personal review Act is like the Kryptonite for rule

431
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
How much work went into a rule

432
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
I can just disappear overnight

433
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
Never to return

434
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:26,783
And I know it sounds harsh and you people put their whole lives into some of these rules and they can

435
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,575
If you suddenly overturned by Congress

436
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,391
But we're talking about here is a much bigger issue

437
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
Which is this

438
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,975
Balance of power between the presidency

439
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
And

440
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
The Congress

441
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
And even fighting over this sort of thing

442
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,143
For decades Congress has a point which is

443
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,543
As the present is taking more and more power in writing rules to the change laws through rulemaking

444
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
Trying to take back power

445
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:56,223
And frankly when Congress does this uses the Congressional review act they do take a vote it is democratic

446
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,319
And they could be getting a lot more power in the pretty near few

447
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,159
There is a bill going through Congress right now called the midnight rule Relief act

448
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,463
Just beastly this bundle and Destroy idea

449
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:10,047
And what we do is allow Congress and President Trump

450
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,399
To take all the rules passed by the Obama Administration since June

451
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,935
And undo that

452
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,215
With one vote

453
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,871
Which could dramatically shift a lot of power back to work Congress because with one vote think of what they could do to the Obama

454
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
Administration taken take away

455
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,759
The offshore drilling rule Planned Parenthood rule the stream protection rule we've been talking about

456
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:30,783
It could all

457
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
Just finish

458
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,111
Euchre when the rules expert says

459
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,439
Even if it passes though he's he's not sure this will hold up

460
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:42,815
Once it's enacted if it's an active do you know it too could be challenged in court I mean you know one

461
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,631
The one thing you learn in Washington is nothing's ever over

462
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
Another rule in Washington ever

463
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
Everything comes around

464
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,031
If republicans in Congress Creek

465
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
New ability

466
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
To overturn

467
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
Presidential rules

468
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,919
Then someday it may be used against

469
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:01,503
It may be used by a democratic Congress to overturn Republican rules

470
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,551
Maybe even in Donald Trump's final

471
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,903
In the meantime David Cochran the man who wrote the OSHA rule that got over

472
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,999
Has a few words of advice for the screen protection advocates

473
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,791
They are biting their nails waiting to see

474
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,583
See what will become of their rule

475
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,191
He says there is a quote that he has taken great solace in and he reads it to himself

476
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
When he's feeling really low

477
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,751
Here let me see if

478
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
I can pull it up

479
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127
Quotes okay

480
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,759
The only kinds of fights worth fighting are those you are going to lose

481
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:41,183
Because somebody has to fight them and lose and lose and lose until someday somebody

482
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:47,839
In order for somebody to win an important major fight a hundred years hence

483
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
A lot of other people have to be willing

484
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:53,471
For the sheer Joy fun and joy of it

485
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,775
To go right ahead and fight knowing

486
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,847
You're going to lose you mustn't feel like a martyr

487
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
You got to enjoy it

488
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,407

Davidson always not actually lost because it's even though his rule got erased

495
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:24,447
He still gets calls all the time from employers and workplaces asking him to send

496
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
The old rules

497
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983

Auntie says ergonomics repetitive stress injuries

500
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
Went from being kind of a joke

501
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,943
To being something that employers take really serious

502
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,223
You going to have to roll

503
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
