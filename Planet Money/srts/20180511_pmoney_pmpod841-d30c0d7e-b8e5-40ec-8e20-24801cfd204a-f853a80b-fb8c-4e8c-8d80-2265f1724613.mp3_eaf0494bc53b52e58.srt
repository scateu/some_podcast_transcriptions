00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,496

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
In Shannon Ireland

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,896
On my way back to the United States to New York

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,688
There is this

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,712
Picture wall

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,272
Giant pictures of all the famous people who come through here

00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,552
Xenon headlights

14
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,384

16
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:51,968

The story of Duty Free starts with a

62
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Bit of Irish

63
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
In the 1940s when people were traveling from New York to London or Paris

64
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,984
There in these propeller plane

65
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:27,360
And to refuel they had to land in the first Runway they saw after crossing the Atlantic

66

This man in the region

00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:02,432
Is there any fish that everyone realized pretty quickly that they needed to upgrade the local amenities

00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
Sometimes it was even in these

93
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,464
Flying boats basically planes that would land on water

94
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,024

They needed someone

110
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,303
They hired Brendan O'Regan to

111
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,631
He was a man who was very soft-spoken

112
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Playas

113
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935

00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591

From the very beginning

121
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
Rather than

122
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,063
Continental Cuisine with

123
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
Which is what they were serving at airports everywhere

124
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
He served

125
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Irish

126
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,487

00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,887
Wendy would serve Whiskey in the coffee

131
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
He topped it off with this

132
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Thick layer

133
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,727
Local cream

134
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
And he named it the very first

135
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Irish coffee

136
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,919
We over again created the very first Irish coffee is delicious Irish coffee is

00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,247
And here in this little

139
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Kiosk

140
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039

Cheap stuff

144
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,255
But the point here is that everything was always tax

145
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,023
Back in those days

146
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
Well not everything

147
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,887
Pizzeria noticed that there was this Loop

148
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,751
In the British Isles it had been a tradition that Sailors about to head off on their own

149
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
Voyage

150
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,591

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
Yep which I don't know why would they do that just to

153
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,551
Keep the crews happy I think that's right. That must have been an element amateur

154
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,391
Have some sleep off a lot of the time I don't know what that was a tradition that went way back

155
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
YouTube

156
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,487
Alex 17th century our way way way back hundreds of years

157
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,327
And strangely this loophole was still in effect in Oregon State

158
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,143
In 1950 he was on a trip to the United States

159
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
Any decide not to

160
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Flyback

Expensive stuff

166
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,223
He's been serving at the airport

Oldest alcohol and tobacco was good so Judy free

168
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,879
Because they were in international waters this is like the law of the high seas

169
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,975
So he said wait now we're competing with these guys

170
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Fire

171
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
It's not fair

172
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,071
That I contact the same text about used to have

173
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,887
And this was the genius of Brendan O'Regan

174
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,191
He went to the Irish government he said

175
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Essentially

176
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
What are airplanes

177
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
But votes

178
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,871
Of the sky kind of Truth and what are airline passengers

179
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
Modern-day Sailors of the

180
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,503
Cloud right also deserve their tax

181
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
Free rotten

And Haribo brand gummy bears

184
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
His exact words are lost

185
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
The history but we do know

186
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
Did a lot of people the Irish government said

187
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
Latex free

188
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Are you kidding me

189
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
Because every

190
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,423
The proper to put out every Customs people worldwide

191
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
Resist

192
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
Getting away tax revenue

193
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,359
Shredder for tickly of this paste Marley the idea who you who's benefiting out of this

194
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
Wealthy people who

195
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,967
Fly the Atlantic and plain semi that's only a tiny percentage

196
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Population

197
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
Why should we do any good for them

198
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,367
The government stood to lose a lot of money if they went with this tax

199
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Freeskiing because

200
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,671
In some cases

201
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,487
When you buy alcohol most of the price tag is

202
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Actually tax

203
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
Steven taking today

204
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,423
If you buy a bottle of wine down the street here in the United States

205
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
There is a duty added to the

206
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Lacoste

207
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,799
Of that wine if the wind comes from overseas

208
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,871
But even if the wine is made in United States there is a

209
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
Federal excise tax

210
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,711
An alcohol addict the price

211
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,503
And then each and every state add

212
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
Their own excise taxes

213
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,367
To the wine and this is all hidden in the price tag

214
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Plus

215
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,719
Then when you bring the wine to the counter oven you have

216
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
To pay sales tax

217
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
And on the total

218
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,327
Brendan O'Regan said to the Irish cover

219
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
Yes

220
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
Yes you will lose some money in taxes

221
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
But in the long run

222
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
If we do this

223
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
Will attract people to come to shadow

224
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
If we attract people to come to Shannon

225
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
MCR let some of them might decide to

226
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
Don't visit the place

227
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,967
Will make people aware of

228
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,991
Irish Goods

229
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
Irish whiskey was not

230
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
Property of acids minuscule of the US compared with

231
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,367
Scotch whiskey

232
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,511
Will make money because I the franchisee of office government-owned

233
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,839
Airports and you're making

234
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,935
The prophets so I'll I'll make you a lot more profit some particular I'll make you a dollar profit

235
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
So

236
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Ireland said

237
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
Alright let's try it

238
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
But

239
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,383
We are keeping you on a very short leash

240
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
Or we can open the first duty-free shop

241
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,247
In the Shannon Airport in 1951

242
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
Okay it was only for passenger

243
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
Ecodistricts you will recognize from today

244
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,927
It was located between the lounge and the restaurant

245
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
So you had to walk through it

246
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
To get to anything

247
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
I hate that no it's

248
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,351
Brilliant and just like he promised the government

249
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
He featured Local Foods and crafts

250
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
I saw an early photo

251
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
Hanging in the airport

252
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:51,359
There's a picture of Gene Kelly the the the old dance from the old days buying

253
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
Butter or cheese or something

254
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,967
At the duty-free other selling

255
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
What looks like

256
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Ham

257
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
Bacon

258
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Honey

259
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
Cheese

260
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
Jam and eggs

261
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,719
We was just like a farmer's market in the airport

262
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,303
I think the local stuff was kind of first show because honestly

263
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,583
From the beginning

264
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,655
This was all about cigarettes

265
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
And alcohol

266
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
Whiskey and smokes were Apparently one

267
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
Third the price you would pay outside the airport

268
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
It was so cheap

269
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
Irish government was paranoid

270
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,455
Irish gangs with try to smuggle alcohol

271
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,759
Out of the airport and you can make a fortune right

272
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,575
They required Oregon to take inventory

273
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
3 *

274
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,671
Add a new account for every single bottle

275
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
If he actually dropped or misplaced

276
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,535
Single bottle he would have to pay all the tax

277
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
And this was

278
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,143
Within just 6 months Oregon had to

279
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,167
Band the store

280
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,007
Because all of these other manufacturers wanted their products

281
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
In there too

282
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
I mean

283
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,591
This is a captive Market of

284
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Rich people

285
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
On vacation

286
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,479
In came the Leica cameras and the Omega

287
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:06,623
Watches even relatively inexpensive products discovered that they could get some of that airport

288
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
Glamour

289
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:11,743
I just getting placed between the Chanel Number 5 and the cuckoo clocks

290
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,583
At least that's what mr. tobler of Switzerland thought

291
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,679
Mr tobler was there with a real person

292
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
Theodor tobler Theodor tobler

293
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,263
Coup

294
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Create the chocolate bar

295
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,847
Not just any chocolate bar

296
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
The Toblerone

297
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,919
A triangular prism of delicious

298
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,991
It was sold in that very first Shannon Duty

299
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Freeshop

300
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,623
Tom Armitage is an executive with Mondelez International which owns total

301
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
The word comes from the combination of alleles is

302
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
Sonic tobler with the Italian word

303
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
Which means

304
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,167
It's kind of like that

305
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,127
You got that loud

306
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:05,247
Golden Nugget

307
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
Duty-free with

308
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
Huge break for the chocolate bar

309
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Pictures of odd

310
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
Because there aren't really heavy duties and taxes

311
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
Chocolate not like alcohol

312
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
But

313
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,535
It did fit the duty-free aesthetic

314
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
It was kind

315
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Weird fancy looking

316
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
Get you could

317
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,959
Hyatt with leftover change in your pocket from what you do

318
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
Spend on that Swiss watch

319
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,871
It would take a few more years for Toblerone in the duty-free concept to spread worldwide

320
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,711
All these International delegations would visit Oregon shop

321
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
And they saw how much you

322
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
He was making and I thought

323
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Wait a minute anyone could do this

324
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,439
Amsterdam open II duty-free shop in the world and their airport in night

325
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
57 in 90

326
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
62

327
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,023
A private company

328
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,047
DFS

329
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
Open the first duty-free shop in the United

330
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
Red States

331
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Why

332
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
Come Armitage the Toblerone guy says

333
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
But the numbers just

334
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Took off from there

335
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Duty-free stores will do

336
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
Do 70 billion dollars

337
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,335
Worth of business

338
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
Justice

339
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,663
5 billion of that is candy

340
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
And Tom will give you the chocolate stats

341
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
All day long

342
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
Euphotic beauty4u to Country

343
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
It would be the 9th

344
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Biggest

345
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
Chocolate Market

346
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
In the world

347
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Wow

348
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
Okay the 9th biggest chocolate monkey

349
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
In the world

350
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
Effectively

351
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Just

352
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,655
Just behind friends and just ahead of India

353
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,751
The more people buy chocolate in duty free

354
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
Send buy chocolate in India

355
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
By value

356
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:38,943
These days Toblerone make special chocolate bars specifically designed for.

357
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
Actually if you think about it

358
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
The perfect place for test marketing and data

359
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,439
It's the one kind of store will you know which customers will show up

360
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
When

361
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,535
So if the flight from Paris to New York JFK

362
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
Takes off at 1:28 p.m.

363
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,887
Then the duty-free store is filled with Americans

364
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
Right at noon

365
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
And you can test new products

366
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
IDOC

367
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,567
Chocolate Toblerone milk chocolate Toblerone

368
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
Crunchy almond Toblerone

369
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
Temple Run

370
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
Messaging for example on the Toblerone fleas

371
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,783
What is the message that I forgot to

372
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,623
To get you a gift in Paris at the airport

373
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:23,743
He would say for example I love you thinking of you

374
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
The duty-free store concert

375
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
The idea behind it became so big

376
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
So powerful in marketing

377
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,727
The people sort of forgot about that original duty-free shop

378
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
In the Shannon Airport

379
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,823
And once long-range passenger Jets were invented

380
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,407
Not as many people needed to stop over in rural Ireland

381
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
For an Irish coffee

382
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:46,527
And because Brendan O'Regan didn't try to own the concept

383
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,111
Sadly did not become a duty-free billionaire

384
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
But other businessmen would

385
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
But you know

386
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
O'Regan

387
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
Remained

388
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
Hero

389
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Of Ireland

390
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
He helped set up Textra manufacturing Zone

391
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,143
He became obsessed with the way that trade could help

392
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
World Peace

393
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:06,239
Any set of all of these to a piece exchanges

394
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
It's between the Republic of Ireland

395
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
And Northern Ireland

396
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,871
The people say we're really instrumental in

397
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
Creating the peace process

398
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
Brian O'Connell has just published a new biography

399
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
City of Brandon over

400
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
And so

401
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
She's a little biased

402
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,319
IPad but

403
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
She believes that

404
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
First little store in

405
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
The airport

406
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
Change the world

407
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
If he hadn't.

408
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,303
There would be no airport duty free business of the world it wouldn't ever

409
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
Taking off in my opinion

410
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,679
Really Bianca Bethune doing favors for

411
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
Wealthy people are traveling

412
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
Would have been a big factor

413
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
When you put it that way

414
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
You have shops at airport

415
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
But did you see free industry

416
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
Would not have developed

417
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,711
It was o'regan's gift

418
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
To all of us trap

419
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:53,087
But exactly how generous a gift was it

420
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
Will have the answer

421
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
After the break

436
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,399
That was the history of duty-free but now the psychology

437
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,679
Duty-free because

438
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:45,055
When I walk through these places in airport there's a strange feeling that comes over me

439
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,943
I feel like I'm part of this exclusive clock and I'm just paid hundreds of dollars for ticket

440
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
I presented my passport

441
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,015
People with guns Guardian

442
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
And I walkthrough

443
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
It's soap

444
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
It's filled with all these vices

445
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,903
Cigarette

446
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
Alcohol

447
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,511
So many scotches

448
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,095
So many statues and whiskey

449
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
And also

450
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
A little bored

451
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,983
So it's basically the classic setup to spend

452
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Too much money

453
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
By Design

454
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Play

455
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:22,943
We just tried to find a definitive study to find out how much of a break you're really getting a duty free

456
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,735
Yes there are no taxes

457
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
But

458
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,087
You have to pay for all this very expensive airport retail

459
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
So it's almost impossible to

460
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
Figure out the bottom line

461
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,695
Every duty free store has

462
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Different prices

463
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
Different exchange rate

464
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,303
A tax break depends on how much tax

465
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,839
You usually pay back at home

466
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,911
So I try to get at least some anecdotal

467
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,263
I was traveling with my family through the Milan airport in Italy

468
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,567
And my daughter Elsa and I spent

469
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
An hour

470
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
Logging all the time

471
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,687
Here's a carton of Camel cigarettes

472
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,271
39.5 Euro

473
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
VSOP

474
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
48.5 Euro

475
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,951
Jameson for your deal

476
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,511
17 Euro 18.2 Euro

477
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
U-Save 7.8 Euro

478
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,935
And what was your verdict on duty free

479
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
It depends

480
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,567
I know that is not the answer you want to hear I will tell you that tax-free cigarettes

481
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
Are criminal cheap

482
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,431
Under $5 a pack and they're almost three times.

483
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
Here in York City

484
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
So

485
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
If you want cigarettes

486
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Buy cigarettes in

487
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,063
Other deals

488
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
Are harder to find

489
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,927
My daughter Kelsey is a expert in makeup

490
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
Okay so

491
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
Giorgio Armani

492
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
Luminous silk Foundation

493
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,143
Natural silky lightweight fluid

494
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:50,751
Really expensive Foundation

495
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
That's still not that much it's so expensive

496
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,127
No that's just the display one this is the

497
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
When you buy I would never pay that much

498
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
But I checked your New York

499
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
And

500
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Not the worst

501
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,599
Price for Giorgio Armani so not to buy

502
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,159
But when it comes to alcohol there is no log

503
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
American whiskeys in Milan

504
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
Are 2/3 the price of what you would pay here in the United States

505
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,375
Even though they ship it all the way to Milan. All the way back true

506
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,167
But Courvoisier

507
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
From France next door to Italy

508
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,775
What's more expensive in the duty-free

509
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
This is here in New York

510
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,615
And toblerones

511
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,919
I hate to disappoint you or almost double

512
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,711
The US price

513
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,247
If we aren't always getting a

514
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,527
Steel on products

515
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
And the governments are losing out on Tagged

516
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
Tax revenue then what's the point

517
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
What is my Siri

518
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
On this

519
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
If they let you know when

520
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,767
Ireland first started duty-free was this

521
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
True bargain

522
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
And Ireland got all these benefits from the ex

523
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
Detroit business

524
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:56,031
But then what happens is this race to the bottom every other airports starts to offer the exact same time

525
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
Brakes just to come

526
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,359
And then once everyone has a duty

527
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,175
Free shopping there's pressure just to make your Airport

528
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
Duty-free shop

529
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,039
Bigger brighter and fancier exactly everyone ends up with this one

530
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,903
Expensive shopping mall and somewhere in all of this the tax break concept

531
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
Just sort of gets

532
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Lost

533
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
Prices start to stick back up because

534
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Who can really tell

535
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,839
It's only the people making the money or not

536
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,631
The Travelers but the shop

537
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
Sups

538
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Any airports

539
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,983
Which you'll notice are now redesigning themselves

540
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,287
To provide even more space for duty free

541
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,783
Okay cosmopolitan's if you spot a glitch in the international trade system

542
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Hear about it
