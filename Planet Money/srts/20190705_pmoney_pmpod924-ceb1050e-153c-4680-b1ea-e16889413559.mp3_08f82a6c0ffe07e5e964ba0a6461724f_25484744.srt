1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,376
Is this is probably not your first Studio interview in your life is it

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,400
Or is it

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,936
The first one with disc

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,496
A white brothers equipment

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,800
Kenneth kid is a geneticist

6
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,824
At Yale

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,384
And in some circles he's a pretty big deal

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
For example

9
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,456
He was one of the first scientists

10
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,808
To persuade judges to accept DNA as evidence in American courtrooms

11
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,904
But the wake and got tangled up in the story we're going to be talking about today

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,976
Has to do with a project that he's been working on for decades

13
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,840
It's trying to understand human genetic variation

14
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,376
Around the world

15
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,656
The idea is

16
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
As if you draw someone's blood

17
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:45,056
Get their DNA and then look for the right markers inside that DNA

18
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,128
You can probably figure out what region or ethnic

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,456
A person comes from kind of like 23andMe but fancy

20
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,296
And four years can has been testing this idea this idea that

21
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,648
Certain markers in your DNA show where you come from and to test that idea

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,280
Do you need a DNA samples from people of all different ethnicities from all different parts of the world

23
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,424
But in 2010 there was still a big hole in the global genetic picture that he was trying to assemble

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,984
A place where he didn't have a lot of genetic samples

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
From yet

26
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
And that place

27
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
With China

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,664
There's like more than billion people there I imagine there's a lot of genetic diversity that's worth money

29
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,456
Yes

30
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,736
There is

31
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:31,392
What Ken says he didn't know what he couldn't know with how China would end up using his research

32
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,720
Any did you have any concerns at the outset

33
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,256
Not

34
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,536
At the outset

35
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:43,168
You see what Kenwood later find out was that his collaboration with Chinese scientist

36
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
Would end up helping Advance one of the biggest

37
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,544
Most invasive surveillance

38

Vulcan Planet Money

41
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
China is building a

42
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:06,720
Huge high-tech system for tracking targeting and cracking down on minority

43
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,048
And they're developing much of that technology on their own

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
But they're also relying on the work of American society

45
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
Today the show we're going to tell the stories of two men

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
YouTube

47
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
In very different ways

48
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,080
Got caught up in the scariest

49
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,384
Most dystopian police state

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
We turned up and I'm very long

51
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
One of them

52
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
A scientist

53
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
The other

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
Just a guy trying to have a summer vacation

55
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
Is there any part of it

56
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
Feel sorry for kind of

57
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
I absolutely do

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
I mean the thing is

59
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,584
He's extremely irresponsible and negligee

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
Start doing what he did

61
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
But

62
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
At the same time

63
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,240
Everyone makes mistakes right

The part of China that we're going to be talking about today is

80
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
Pretty closed off

81
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
It's called sinkiang province

82
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,104
Nearly half of the people there are uyghurs a Muslim minority

83
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,432
And over the last several years the Chinese communist

84
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
Party has been ramping up its

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,248
Persecution

86
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
Have the wee course

87
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:12,160
Journalists don't get real access conditioning John they're often followed by government minders they

88
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
I only get to see what the government wants them to see

89
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:20,607
So today our guide into the police state that's being built there is a man who saw firsthand WhatsApp

90
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
Because he lived it

91
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
And is willing to talk to us about it

92
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,799
But we're going to take some steps to protect his identity asked us to use a different name

93
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
And the boys are about to hear

94
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
It's a boy voice actor

95
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:37,247
Voice actor who is reciting word-for-word from the interview with our source

96
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Olam is a grad student in the US

97
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
He's uyghur and he grew up in sinkiang

98
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:47,999
And two summers ago he went on a trip home that helped him understand just how much everything there is

99
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,071
The trip started out like most of his summer break

100
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Text Ed

101
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
On a long flight to China

102
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
He watched a couple movies nap

103
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,495
8-up pretty mediocre airplane Halal meal

104
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
And I'm on the plane landed

105
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Flight attendant

106
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
And she was like

107
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,431
Oh they're asking for you

108
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,735
There might be something wrong with your Visa

109
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
And I was like

110
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,831
I don't need visa

111
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:19,231
I'm a citizen of this country he's like I come home every summer and nothing like this has ever happened before

112
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
And then she was like

113
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,863
Oh and I I don't know what's going on you should probably should go and see them

114
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,983
Police officers take him off the plane they searched him question him for 4 hours

115
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
And then I tell him he's under arrest

116
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
The charge

117
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,871
Disrupting the societal order

118
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,175
And then I started

119
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
Laughing

120
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
Coughing

121
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
Yeah

122
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
I a laugh

123
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Hysterically

124
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,831
Because it sounded

125
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
Bizarre

126
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
To me like

127
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,975
Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine getting arrest

128
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
On had heard stories about uyghurs being detained by the Chinese government which has been cracking down on the group

129
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Because they say uyghur

130
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Suppose a terrorism

131
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,751
Almost nowhere near that were

132
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
In the US so

133
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
He was thinking this whole time

134
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,455
I'm just going home to see my family eat some good home cook Weaver food

135
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
But this trip with

136
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
Turn out nothing like that

137
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
The police bring a lamb to a hospital

138
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,415
And they say he needs to undergo a quote

139
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Health check

140
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
They took me to

141
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,743
A room

142
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,815
To do ultrasound

143
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
An ultrasound of where

144
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
My

145
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
Belly

146
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
Of my organs

147
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
I guess

148
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,591
Belly like as if you were a pregnant woman exactly

149
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Yeah

150
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,431
Didn't take him to a windowless room they started

151
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,479
Taking pictures of my face

152
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,599
From all kinds of different angles you mean they move the cameras

153
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,719
Almost 360 Degrees around your head to take it yes your head your face smell different

154
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
Vantage points yes

155
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
They did

156
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
And then

157
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,631
After that they started to tell me

158
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,167
Open my mouth

159
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
Event taking pictures of that

160
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,543
And then close my mouth and then taking pictures of that

161
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
Unlike

162
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Reveal my teeth

163
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,895
Like kind of like

164
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,455
Smile and then taking pictures of that

165
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
It's as if

166
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
They're trying to

167
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
Gemini like

168
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,855
Take pictures of my facial expressions

169
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
At this point

170
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
Alarm starts to realize

171
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,487
The government is building a profile on

172
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
That is what they want on this date at 4

173
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
Did you ever feel like you could say no

174
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
No

175
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,191
That's that's not negotiable

176
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
I felt like if I

177
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,079
If I tried to resist

178
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,895
It was only look bad on me

179
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,687
And make me feel like

180
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
Make

181
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,503
Make them think

182
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
That I'm a criminal

183
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
So I cooperated with

184
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
Everything

185
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
To take his hand prints that take us

186
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
Is footprints

187
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
They sit him down and record his voice

188
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,023
They handed me this this

189
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815
Passage in Hoover

190
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:07,423
And told me to read it in front of a very expensive-looking mic

191
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
Finally they take to tube

192
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
Types of olives black

193
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,079
And then an officer Blatz a little piece of paper with his

194
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,407
Labeled it with his name and national ID number

195
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
Places the paper in a box

196
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
As he was placing my sample

197
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
My blood sample

198
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,135
Into the box I could see

199
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,487
Easily hundreds of other samples

200
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
Because I could see people's

201
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Names

202
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,351
That ID cards

203
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
Just like mine

204
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,679
Attached to that blood sample

205
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
Hundreds of other people's

206
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,007
Blood we're in that box

207
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Yes

208
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
It's not just hundreds

209
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
It's million

210
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
Human rights groups say the Chinese government is forcing every person in sinkiang from the ages of 12

211
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
B5

212
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,831
To go through a health check

213
00:08:57,343 --> 00:09:01,695
And that the government has thrown more than a million of these people into so-called

214
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
Haitian camps

215
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
That is where all them

216
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
And it up

217
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
After the tell check

218
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:12,447
She was sent to a detention center and he spent his days watching propaganda videos

219
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,799
Chanting slogans about how great the Chinese Communist party was

220
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,615
Reciting rules against extremism

221
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,151
And then

222
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,455
One day the police tell all them

223
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
You can leave

224
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Just like that

225
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
The guard came to me

226
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
And then he was like

227
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
Pack your stuff

228
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,927
And then I was like I don't have any stuff

229
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
And then he was like

230
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
Come out

231
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
They take him to his family's apartment

232
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,119
And then for the first time in 28 days

233
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:41,887
He's free

234
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
And he's thinking

235
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:49,311
I can finally do what I come back for every summer I can go play soccer with my buds I can

236
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,103
Walk around my hometown

237
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
Eat a bunch of samsa's

238
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Does it like

239
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:54,943
Uyghur

240
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,503
But as he starts going about his life

241
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
He starts to notice that

242
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
Things are really different

243
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
As soon as I get out of the building

244
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
I actually am

245
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,999
Notice cameras in the apartment complex

246
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
Witches

247
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,423
You know weird because there wasn't cameras last year and over the next few days he realizes it's

248
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,727
Not just new cameras that are everywhere

249
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,335
There are also these new police station like literally one on every block

250
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,871
They call them

251
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:28,479
Convenience police stations convenience police stations

252
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:33,087
Yeah that's supposed to create convenience for the people

253
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
They say you can

254
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,463
Charge your phone inside or you can use the restroom inside

255
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
But

256
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,791
Everyone knows the police station

257
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:48,447
There are these signs on them that say beware of three evil forces the three evil forces

258
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,775
Terrorism extremism and separatism

259
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
He says

260
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
It was weird

261
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
He was noticing all this stuff

262
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
The cameras.

263
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
Police stations a bunch of extra police

264
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
But no one was

265
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
Hawking

266
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
But once he was over at his uncle

267
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,415
And one of his family members starts talking about Ramadan

268
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,487
Which at this point had pretty much been outlawed in ching chong

269
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
And my uncle

270
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
Immediately stop the conversation

271
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,351
He was like no

272
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,447
Don't talk about this don't talk about anything that would get us into trouble

273
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,543
Because those Vehicles outside with the giant antennas

274
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,335
What do you think those are for

275
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
The listening to

276
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,199
They're listening to conversations that are happening in our homes

277
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,759
He says people weren't really talking about

278
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,039
Anything of substance

279
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,623
Because they didn't even know what they weren't supposed to be talking about

280
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
It's still

281
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
Kind of felt

282
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
Lake prison

283
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,327
I felt like I have no Freedom like even though I was

284
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Technically free

285
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,423
And then all I'm even began to doubt if

286
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
She was

287
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Technically

288
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
It started this one day

289
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,663
When he and his friend were just walking to the mall to have lunch and I was entering the small

290
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
And at the entrance

291
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
There's a security check

292
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
He said these checkpoints are all over the

293
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,135
The kind of looks like a cross between an airport metal detector and a Subway turn

294
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Style

295
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,303
There's camera and a screen attached to it so you can see yourself being recorded yourself yeah yeah

296
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Absolutely

297
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,143
His friend goes through first and his ID

298
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,911
Walkthrough

299
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
And then

300
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
It's all a

301
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
I scan my ID

302
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Immediately

303
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
Orange alert came up

304
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,359
A bright orange light

305
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
And a police officer calls

306
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,991
And then it was like yeah yeah come in come into the station

307
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
Alan said that all he was thinking was

308
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
This is it

309
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
I'm going back into

310
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,367
Detention

311
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Police officers

312
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
Hey follow me into the station just sit down

313
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
I just got to ask you some

314
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:53,119
And while he was filing that on his computer that I asked him

315
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,679
So is this a mistake or

316
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
What's going on

317
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,751
And then he was like

318
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:05,151
Oh they just updated the system today you probably shouldn't go anywhere

319
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
And then I was like

320
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
What do you mean

321
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:14,111
And then he was like you know I have every public place has this machine and they would flag you each time and

322
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,207
We don't want to you know do this filing every time you come back to the

323
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
Station Inn

324
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
You don't want to come back either I assume

325
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:27,167
So just stay home that means you're under house arrest basic but that's exactly what I was thinking

326
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,031
She goes back home having no idea really what his status

327
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,615
Whether there been some glitch in the system or if they ask

328
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Had something on him

329
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,455
Or if you've been permanently flagged as a c

330
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Security risk

331
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,575
But then one day he would have friend who works for the government who says

332
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
You want to know what your status is

333
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
I have this app

334
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
On my phone

335
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
I can look you up

336
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,767
He pulled out his phone open this app

337
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
And then I told him my ID card number

338
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
And then

339
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
Right after he press confirm

340
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,239
My picture and a lot of different information shows

341
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
And he said

342
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:08,383
There's an orange warning on your ID card

343
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
That's usually used for

344
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Criminal

345
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,015
And he was shot

346
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
He said

347
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
You can't leave the city

348
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
Let alone China 2

349
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Go back to school

00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
What was that app

354
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,983
And what is all this technology that's being used to track all them

355
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
We'll find out more

356
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
After the break

357
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,151
Support for NPR comes from Newman's Own Foundation

Police officers waiting on every block

What he couldn't see was the scale of the digital prison around him

370
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,007

373
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:48,991
So he's been trying to figure out as much as she can about the surveillance technology being used in sinkiang

374
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
She's a China director at Human Rights

375
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:57,439
Watch this spring she and her team got their hands on the app that police in sinkiang are using to track

376
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Uyghur

377
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
Probably the same at that all it was

378
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,095
And her team reverse-engineer.

379
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
And what we were able to show

380
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,983
By unpacking the source code of this app that

381
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,287
Behavior ranging from

382
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,359
Suddenly socializing less with your neighbors

383
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Got suspicious

384
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:22,271
Talking to family members overseas going out the back door instead of the front door putting gas in somebody else's car

385
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,343
All of these behaviors that are perfectly legal

386
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
Perfectly legal are now considered

387
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Suspicious

388
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
And

389
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,023
The bad information can and will be used against you

390
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,375
And Toby's team isn't just looking at this app they're looking at everything

391
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,471
Like for example that security checkpoint that all-in-one through at the mall

392
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,287
It is way more advanced than he ever knew

393
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,847
Recognition software

394
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,943
You know they'll always walk literally The Way You Walk that's monitor

395
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,343
Correct and identifies you correct wow and all of that is linked to a central database about who you are and all this other

396
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
Correct

397
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,975
One other thing so he's been doing is she's been trying to track America

398
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,047
Who are helping China build these high-tech social

399
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
End

400
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,351
Quite frankly

401
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,887
Shaymin so they'll stop doing

402
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,423
She had some successes

403
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,823
But it's meant digging through stacks of obscure documents trying to understand complex science

404
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
Is this company based in Massachusetts

405
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
Thermo Fisher

406
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
They make these things called DNA soup

407
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,063
We actually found from looking at police tender documents

408
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
Thermo Fisher Scientific

409
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,719
Had sold DNA sequencers to the xinjiang public Security Bureau

410
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,791
So he called them out and they said they would stop

411
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
Selling fishing John

412
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,631
Her team also called out iflytek

413
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,959
Which is this Chinese company that collaborating with MIT

414
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,567
Iflytek has supplied a lot of voice recognition technology to shrink John

415
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
MIT says they agreed to the collaboration the

416
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,967
For the University came up with a whole new review process for

417
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Elevated risk

418
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
International

419
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,831
But they're still collaborating that I fight

420
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
By the way

421
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,951
Voice recognition technology is why were using a voice actor for Gollum

422
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,255
Remember how police made him read out loud

423
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,327
A page of uyghur text in front of a fancy microphone

424
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
Well they have his voice

425
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Forever

426
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
An engineer's that NPR told us

427
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,471
Even if we tried to distort his voice

428
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
It could be reverse engineer

429
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:24,639
Sophie says there is one particular American who worked with the Chinese police who stands out to her

430
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:27,455
She remembers when she first got a tip about him

431
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
I was sitting in the Brussels Airport

432
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
Reading

433
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,855
That packet of information and help

434
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
Physically

435
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Lll

436
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
She was reading about a geneticist

437
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
At Yale

438
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Names

439
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Kenneth

440
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
Kit

441
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
The guy from the beginning of the show

442
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
Do you feel that you have done absolutely nothing

443
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Wrong

444
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
I have done nothing wrong

445
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,287
Here's can story in short

446
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,151
In 2010 he got an invitation to travel to Beijing from the Chinese Ministry of

447
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Security

448
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:02,783
Which is like the Chinese police says he collaborates with law enforcement all the time

449
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
He does DNA work

450
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,623
So can fly to China and meets one of the top

451
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
Scientist for the Chinese

452
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:13,535
And she says hey I'm also interested in this DNA ancestry marker stuff

453
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,679
Also thanks to my job I have access to DNA from all sorts of ethnicities from all over.

454
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
So she says

455
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Do you want to work together

456
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Can I come visit your lab

457
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,335
Ken says sure come on over to Yale University

458
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,431
And she spent a year inside that lab a pretty productive year

459
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,991
It's capped off with a paper that they co-author together

460
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,039
And one of the paper looks at

461
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,879
Is what differentiates the DNA of certain ethnic

462
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:43,487
Groups including groups that the Chinese government is targeting in shenyang like

463
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
Uyghur stodgy

464
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
Has aux-in kirghiz

465
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,935
We now know that this DNA was most likely not collected consent

466
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,263
McKenna says the scientists working for the Chinese police

467
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,103
She claimed it all her DNA samples including the weaker ones

468
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Gathered with

469
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Permission

470
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
She says

471
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
That

472
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,807
The samples were collected with signed informed consent

473
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
And you didn't question that

474
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,463
On what basis would I

475
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Question

476
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
Penn says he followed accepted

477
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:23,679
And that there was no way he could have independently verified whether there was informed consent

478
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,263
But a lot of people including Sophie Richardson

479
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,847
Are outraged by his collaboration with the Chinese

480
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Police

481
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:37,503
They're also disturbed by the fact that can not only use data drawn from DNA samples that the Chinese police provide

482
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,831
Lighted but that he also provided genetic samples from his own lab

483
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
To the Chinese

484
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Police

485
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,695
And they say he allowed data based on uyghur DNA

486
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,767
To be included in a global database that he runs out of you

487
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,071
Knowing what you know now

488
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
About how the Chinese government

489
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Has treated uyghurs

490
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,823
In-N-Out Ruth wiegers do you still believe that every genetic sample taken from a weaker

491
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,663
Referenced in your database or referenced in your research

492
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
But each one of those samples was

493
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,575
Definitely taken with informed consent you do you really believe that

494
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,440
It's impossible to believe that

495
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
Unequivocally

496
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
But

497
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
On the other hand

498
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
I have no way of knowing

499
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,008
One way

500
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,032
Or the other

501
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,384
Because critics say that by collaborating with the Chinese police

502
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
He helped give China

503
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
The tools to

504
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Figure out

505
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,992
Whether someone is uyghur

506
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,064
Which helps China Advance the system that

507
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Tracks

508
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
Targets and oppresses the uyghur

509
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
10 Tesla

510
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
This collaboration

511
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
This happened years ago

512
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,304
Before much of the world knew what was going on in Shanghai

513
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
I can't no

514
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
Everything that

515
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,728
Going to happen in the future

516
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
Ken says he stopped

517
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,568
Collaborating with the Chinese Ministry of public

518
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
Security

519
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:11,200
And that he's removing all that problematic weaker data from his big database

520
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:17,344
Have you asked scientists at the Chinese Ministry of public security to stop

521
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,672
Using the genetic samples you provided them

522
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Yes

523
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Did they say

524
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
They would stop

525
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,704
I've gotten no reply

526
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
We are stalling

527
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
About tennis

528
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,184
And he said he had heard about him

529
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,280
And even though there is no way that all of his blood sample was used by

530
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Who says

531
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
He still a victim of a system that

532
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
Can help

533
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Advance

534
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
As a human being I can

535
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,752
Relate to making a mistake

536
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Car

537
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
Screwing up big time

538
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
Cuz everyone

539
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Once in awhile

540
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
But

541
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,480
Just thinking about it

542
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
Makes me really angry

543
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,368
It's difficult for me to sympathize with him

544
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:25,696
Knowing the magnitudes of his research

545
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
And

546
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,048
The potential damage his research could do to my people

547
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,608
Alan has good reason

548
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
To be angry

549
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
It's been

550
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,704
2 years but he is still real

551
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,752
Laying in his head the nightmare

552
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
That summer break in shenyang

553
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,128
He waited out the rest of the summer counting down the days

554
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,152
Today's return flight

555
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
Back to the US

556
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,968
Trying to stay under the radar

557
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,552
Name of the summer was nearing its end he went to the airport

558
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,624
Not knowing if his orange alert would mean

559
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
He could never leave China

560
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,256
When he got to the airport the police questioned him for so long that he missed her

561
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Is flight

562
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
Then they said

563
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
Come back tomorrow and try again

564
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,656
So we showed up the next day super early

565
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,008
And they questioned him again but this time they did let him go to the gate

566
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,056
I was still nervous I was like

567
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,104
I'm not out of the woods yet

568
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
They can get me

569
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
Anytime they want

570
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,968
What if they change their mind

571
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:25,344
He says the four hours he waited to get on the plane with the longest of his life

572
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,904
And when we finally boarded the plane

573
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,512
I was still anxious because they knew that they could stop the plane as long as we're on the ground

574
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,584
When we finally took off

575
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,912
Had a huge sigh of relief

576
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,984
And I knew that didn't exist this is it

577
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
Autumn is in the US now

578
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,872
But he sure the Chinese government is still tracking

579
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
So

580
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,432
He's being really careful

581
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
And he says

582
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,272
If authorities found out he was talking to journalists

583
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
Very bad things would happen to his family

584
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,904
We asked him are you planning to go back next summer

585
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
And he said

586
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
I don't think I'll ever go back

587
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:17,056
Hate we have this new cool thing

588
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,640

600

Yes that is actually his real name

601
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,000
Parents are weaker and he grew up in Australia

602
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,072
And your parents named you weaker

603
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
They were

604
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
Very imaginative

605
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,984
