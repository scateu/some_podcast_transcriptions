Jacob as you know there is nothing

8
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,504
I love more than sort of just

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,064
Digging into a nerdy tax

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832

Play Asher and the other day I found one

12
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,440
It perhaps is

13
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,280
Too complicated to nerdy in for Planet Money No Such Thing

14
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,888
Well here me out here this plan is a plan to reform the corporate

00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:44,288
Taxes the tax that corporations pay their profits with me being pushed by University of California Professor Alan R

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,824
It's called

17
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:46,848
I love this

18
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,408
The DBC ft

Yes the acronym we use as a destination based cash flow tax

21
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,512
But we need some PR help I realized

22
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:11,168
Yeah first of all DBC ft is obviously at least two letters too long for negative Simple Rules

23
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,704
Three letters Max for neck

24
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,984

27
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,616
Little bit better and we would not

28
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,920
Even be talking about this plan today except

29
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
The professor got

30
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
The pr help

31
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
That he needed

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
Last week President Donald Trump

33
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
I don't know where

34
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,904
Embrace the strange complicated tax plan

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
Although he didn't

36
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,232
Use any of the initials me the sound way marker map

37
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
Well working on a tax reform bill

38
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,888
That will reduce our trade deficits increase America.

39
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,960
Sports and will generate revenue from Mexico

40
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,800
That will pay for the wall if we decide to go that route

41
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,592
It's fair to say that

42
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
The people

43
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
Freaked out at least 4000

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,040
2 minutes they work I quit what is he talking about is he really going to tax imports from Mexico

45
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
Is it going to increase the price of avocados

46
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Is this the star

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:07,232
The start of the US Mexico trade war and then people realized Trump was talking about

48
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
The dbcf

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,352
Pete the Border adjustment tax this new idea for a corporate

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,656
This was Alan Arabic

51
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
Time to shine

52
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,776
You've been talking about the Border just a text for 15 years

53
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
And now

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
There was

55
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
All over the news

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,384
One small problem

57
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,200
Public Safety border adjustment tax doesn't

58
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,248
Do all of those things that Trump promised

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,344
If his objective is to punish other countries this may not be the way to do it

60
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
But if what he wants to do is

61
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
To encourage

62
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
Investment production and employment

63
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,816
And higher wages in the United States then I think this

64
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
I would fit the bill

65
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,424
This is such a strange moment in US history

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,264
That a protectionist president and a free trade economist

67
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,360
May have found some common ground, ground but could overhaul

68
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
The corporate tax

69
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:04,064

Might work

77
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,336
Although not the way the president thinks it will

Adjustment tax

90
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
Is a replacement for

91

Text

93
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,607
The corporate tax in America is a mess

94
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
Your classic bad

95
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
Because first of all

96
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
It is an incredibly

97
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Hi-Tech

98
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
35

99
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,615
Percent that is the tax levied on profits of corporations that is the

100
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
Highest in the developed world

101
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
Can you bury somebody the United States of America home of

102
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
, business and capitalism

103
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,855
And to also have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed

104
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,415
Yes and on top of that

105
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,743
There are tons of loopholes which is your classic

106
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
Bad text combination High statutory rape

107
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,119
Tons of loopholes and all of these loopholes means

108
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
Companies have a huge incentive

109
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,983
Tahiry all these lawyers to do crazy global

110
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
Tax shenanigans

111
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
Soap for instance

112
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,103
Quickest route back from UC Berkeley says

113
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,919
A global company can sell something that it states

114
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
And say well

115
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:11,039
We make a profit United States we made a profit in our subsidiary in

116
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
Ireland

117
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
And

118
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
It would be hard to track down that money

119
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:18,207
Where does a company like apple earn the money that it makes on an iPhone

120
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,511
Is interning in silicon valley

121
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
Does it hurt in China

122
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:27,167
Does attorney in Ireland where it has some of its intellectual property it's really hard to know

123
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,239
A lot of politicians people run the US government know

124
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,263
This is a problem

125
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,847
And that's why this pretty General support for lowering the corporate tax

126
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,199
President Barack Obama thought the corporate tax rate was too high he wanted to lower it

127
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,551
President Donald Trump promise of the campaign trail that he would lower the corporate tax rate

128
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,903
Anthropologie in the Congress there currently proposing dropping it from 35%

129
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
To 20%

130
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
But if you lower the rate

131
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
That much

132
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,071
Even if you get rid of a lot of those loopholes

133
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,143
The government is still going to wind up with less money every year

134
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,215
Yes one of the major sources of income for the US government so

135
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Where do they get the money

136
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
This

137
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
This my friend

138
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
Is where the Border adjustment tax

139
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
TBC update

140
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
DBC ft

141
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
Which winner

142
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
You will have to admit is

143
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,807
A pretty clever solution

144
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
Republicans in Congress

145
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,671
This is among the tax plan that they are looking at

146
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,999
Right now it is sort of on their short list of things to do

147
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Will explain the Border adjustment

148
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
Okay the way the corporate tax works now

149
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
If you are an American come

150
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
You have to pay the Us corporate tax

151
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,775
On your profits wherever you sell your good so if you

152
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
Make your goods here you sell them here you pay the corporate tax you make them hear you sell them in China and Europe you also pay the Us corporate

153
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,503
Profit is profit you got to pay a corporate tax on profits

154
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
The word respite access to companies listen

155
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
We don't care where you technically

156
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
Book your profits Apple

157
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:57,023
We don't care what you technically book your profits

158
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
What we care about is where you sell

159
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Your products

160
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
Do you sell your product

161
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
In the United States of America

162
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
The philosophy of is the same look

163
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:12,127
We're not exactly sure what corporate residents means anymore and we're not exactly sure where profits are being earned but we're pretty sure we know

164
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
Know where consumers are

165
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:19,039
And if meth Americans are buying things regardless of where they're produced if they're purchased in the US

166
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,343
We want to put a tax on them in if they're not

167
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
We don't

168
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
And that's a very viable tax system

169
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
So you're making all your money in Ireland

170
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
We don't care

171
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,351
We just care where you're selling your stuff if you're selling stuff to Americans in America

172
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
You're going to pay the corporate

173
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
And this is not

174
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
A new crazy idea a lot of countries around the world have something that is that is sort of similar is called

175
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Backpacks

176
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Value added

177
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:50,527
It's okay Robert border adjustment tax let's actually worked out how this wood pellets would actually work for a bit

178
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:54,111
Okay so let's say I have a company a company that

179
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Sell something

180
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927

Okay Shuffle the marbles marbles terrible product

184
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
Don't ever do that again

185
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,311
That's going to get annoying so let's just have a corporation that sells

186
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Sweet sweet music.

187
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
Toke Robertson the current

188
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:32,511
Corporate tax Universe you got your precious little music box company in Brooklyn

189
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,815
You pay the corporate tax

190
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
On your profits

191
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
No matter where you sell your music

192
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
35

193
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Percent

194
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
If taxes on the profit

195
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,823
This substantially changes under the Border adjust

196
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,895
Smith tax under the new tax if it were to pass

197
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:53,759
The big changes come for my music box Corporation if I decide to export a product

198
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
Or importer

199
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,951
And Robert at you talk about your music box business with Eleanor Bach the Berkeley process and you guys started with f

200
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,255
Let's just say these things

201
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
Become the rage

202
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
In Mexico City and I start to

203
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:12,447
Export the master to sell Brooklyn made music boxes

204
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
In Mexico City

205
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
How is that

206
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
Well

207
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
If you sold your music box

208
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
For $500

209
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
Dollars

210
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:29,087
You're making me New York I assume they're very high-end

211
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,439
Assuming that you sell it for $500

212
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,767
The $500 would just be ignored by the IRS

213
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,583
We wouldn't go into your tax calculation that would that would

214
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,167
Be the only change but it's obviously a very big change from the previous Circle

215
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,031
Under this proposal into the Border adjustment if you sell your music boxes in the US

216
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
You still have to pay tax

217
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
On your profit

218
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,175
Tell them in Mexico or in any other country in the world

219
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
No tax on your profit

220
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
This is a huge

221
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,087
Incentive for me to export music boxes and fact

222
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
Huge incentive for

223
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,695
Ous exporters in Wichita can music boxes here

224
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
Boeing

225
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,255
Boeing sells one plane

226
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,815
For 300 million dollars

227
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
Imagine that text free

228
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,167
Get this is a windfall for USA

229
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
There is another half

230
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,287
The tax giveth and the tax

231
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Take it away

232
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,383
Because let's just say I have those music boxes made

233
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
In China

234
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
They're much cheaper

235
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
Make their I can make a larger profit

236
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,599
But my customers are in America and this time this time I do have to pay attack

237
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
So if you

238
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
Import that music box

239
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
For $100

240
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,303
Because it's cheaper to make it in China pages in New York

241
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
And then you sell it for $500

242
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,471
The $500 would be taxable if it's sold in New York

243
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
So you be taxable on the entire thing

244
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,175
Canadian / you think that the decision to Outsource your production

245
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Or maybe I'll just

246
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,551
Charge people more if I'm anemic

247
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
You might

248
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:11,999
If your head is really trying to do the math I'm sure most businesses in the United States will also be trying to figure this out this is

249
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
A good time to employee

250
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
A tax lawyer but I'm going to send this up

251
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,167
If you are an importer in the United States of America under the Border adjustment tax

252
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
You will pay a pretty hefty tax

253
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
If you are an exporter

254
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
You will not

255
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
It's a sweet deal

256
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
And you know this

257
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,407
Seems like it would create an incentive to

258
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,967
Make more things you have to export more stuff

259
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
And and a

260
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
Disincentive to import stuff

261
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,671
This is the part not surprisingly that President Trump is focusing on the kind of big macro implication

262
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
But it's also worth looking at just like

263
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,303
What does it mean to me what is it how's it going to affect

264
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Consumers

265
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
Well

266
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,375
Look at all the stuff

267
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
You bought recently

268
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,447
Was a lot of important

269
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,983
The odds are a lot of wisdom

270
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,567
Whether it's at Walmart or Target Crate & Barrel Best Buy

271
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:03,967
That stuff is brought into the country by American corporations and if those companies are charged

272
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
More taxes because their importers

273
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,343
Surprised they are probably going to raise their prices

274
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,159
If these companies have to pay more in taxes there's a good chance

275
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,999
They're going to pass that on to us will have to pay more for the stuff we bought

276
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
And importers are already logging Congress

277
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Sing

278
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
What are you doing this plan is for judgement tax

279
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:29,055
Would kill us and not just us but your constituents and I just your considered for your pores of constituents violet

280
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
Things at Walmart and Target

281
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
They're the ones who are going to

282
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,199
Basically take the burden of his border adjustment

283
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,063
We want to know what this would mean for the broader economy so we called up Megan green

284
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
She's the chief Economist at John Hancock

285
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,183
As importers are having to pay this tax

286
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,583
They're probably going to pass the price of that on to the end consumer so that means consumers are going to have to pay more

287
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Forgets

288
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:57,727
I mean that's bad for the consumer and also means prices will rise so we'll have inflation

289
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:01,823
And in lower gross because the consumer will be facing this big tax

290
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,663
So we'll be paying more but the economy won't be in as good shape

291
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
And it's negative for the US

292
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Economy

293
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
And to be clear not everybody thinks

294
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,575
All these things would happen

295
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
People like Fester are boxes

296
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,415
Supporters of the Border adjustment tax say

297
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,231
Yes there will be some short time of adjustment

298
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
Where prices might go up

299
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,095
But eventually they say things will return to normal

300
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,911
If you made it this far in the podcast

301
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,727
Thank you first of all thank you

302
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
And

303
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
You are in for a

304
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
Because we are going to talk about

305
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
One of the most

306
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,663
Mystical and satisfying things

307
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
In economics

308
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
We are going to talk about

309
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Currency

310
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Exchange

311
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Currency

312
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Exchange rate

313
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:51,487
Break the value of the dollar and how that is going to affect this whole thing it'll be short we'll make it easy I promise

314
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
3 steps

315
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
Okay so step

316
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
One would you abort

317
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
Step one is

318
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Imports get

319
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
More expensive

320
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
And as a result we import less

321
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,495
The point

322
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
Step 2

323
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
At this point the value of the US dollar

324
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,175
Relative to other currencies the value of US dollar

325
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Goes up

326
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
The dollar gets

327
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Stronger

328
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
And step 3

329
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,575
The stronger dollar

330
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,647
Has the effect of making Imports

331
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
Cheaper

332
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,767
You put the tax on Imports get more expensive

333
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
Bent the value of the dollar changes

334
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
Imports get cheaper

335
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,655
You are basically back where you started

336
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
In theory in the textbook

337
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,543
In the textbook detected any economic textbook

338
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
The debate going on right

339
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,895
Now I'm on, the cross the country is

340
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
How long

341
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Will it take

342
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
For the economy

343
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
To adjust

344
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,855
If you put in this border adjustment tax how long will it take for the economy

345
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
To return

346
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
To normal

347
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
Days months years

348
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
No one knows

349
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
I don't know about the guy who pushes idea he think it'll happen almost overnight

350
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Meaning

351
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Drum roll

352
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
Marbles in a jar

353
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
The Border adjustment tax

354
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,311
Will in theory in the end

355
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,847
Have very little effect

356
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,639
On Imports

357
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
And Expo

358
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Sports

359
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Come on

360
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,247
I know that

361
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
Blew my mind

362
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,111
Robert you ask the obvious question to Professor Auerbach

363
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,743
If you go to all this trouble

364
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,327
Get people together change the laws change the very nature

365
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
Of our corporate tax system

366
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
And then at the end everything

367
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,727
The same

368
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
White mask White

369
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
I think the Border adjustments themselves

370
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,127
In terms of their impact

371
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,431
We are not going to have much of an impact

372
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,503
It's really the changes incentives to companies have

373
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
How to locate production in the US

374
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,879
The other versus other countries

375
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:59,231
Their loss of ability for among those companies that are aggressively shifting

376
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,583
Their taxable profits to other countries Westwood Village to do that

377
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,215
I think that's where it when should focus and thinking about which companies are going to be the winners in which going to be a loser

378
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
So you don't others

379
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,335
Text Shenanigans you read about about companies

380
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,175
Booking their profits in foreign countries about holding money overseas

381
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,759
All the incentives for all of those Shenanigans go away

382
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
With this tax

383
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
According.

384
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,599
But everything else stays the same

385
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
No one is punished

386
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,951
Importers are fine exporters are fine

387
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:33,791
Mexico still will not be paying for the wall if it gets built

388
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,119
Okay I get the theory behind that I got that textbook

389
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,655
Part of that but

390
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,447
I do still wonder

391
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,007
Midday am I not having that way but be

392
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:48,383
What is it going to mean for our economic relationship with the rest of the world right I mean if you're saying

393
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,015
Hey we're going to you don't put this tax on Imports and give a sweet deal to our exports is that going to like

394
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,551
I don't know what is that going to

395
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
MARTA train

396
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
This

397
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
Is a crucial question

398
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
Because as hard as it is to explain the economic

399
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,535
When you add diplomacy on top of that it gets even more complicated

400
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,375
As a final voice I wanted to talk with Carolyn freund she's a

401
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
The trade expert with the Peterson Institute

402
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
She says for the Border adjustment

403
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
Text to work

404
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
It needs to be explained crashing

405
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
AECOM lead other countries

406
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
So they don't retaliate

407
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,919
Donald Trump needs to say

408
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
That this is

409
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:30,367
I can't with all the other countries in the world are doing with their value-added taxes and that this border

410
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,719
Adjustment is standard and economic theory shows it's not protection

411
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,583
I think it really depends on the administration's talking points

412
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,423
Other rhetorical discipline

413
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:50,335
At what this is it was what I was going to say is I think this is what makes people even more nervous about this Administration

414
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
Changing

415
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
Tax the tax

416
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
Code is that from what we've seen so far and it's Granite it's only a week and there's a learning curve but still from what we've seen

417
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,647
So far I don't expect it to happen smoothly

418
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,951
You know this one normal year I would say

419
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
The best tax

420
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Has no chance

421
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
El Paso we probably wouldn't even do a podcast

422
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,583
Because

423
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,423
Think about it there was a Walmart in just about every Congressional

424
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
District

425
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
And

426
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,031
It's hard to explain your constituents a prices

427
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:23,871
Might go up for a while but they'll probably come down and value of the dollar chest

428
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
United States

429
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,431
Political non-starter but

430
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,455
This is not

431
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,991
A normal year

432
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,063
And weirdly the Stars seem to be aligning to

433
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,087
Take some sort of

434
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
Pampa Texas

435
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
Republicans want

436
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
To pass something

437
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
It looks like Lortab

438
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,255
Donald Trump

439
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
He wants to pass something that has the word Border in it

440
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
And as a result

441
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Economist

442
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:48,703
May get to see what happens if you completely transformed

443
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
The corporate tax code

444
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,823
It's a sort of massive experiment to see if the Real World axe

445
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,847
The way the textbook

446
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Cecibel

447
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
What else

448
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Can we explain

449
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
Pelis

450
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,671
On Twitter or Facebook or by emailing

451
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,463
Planet Money at npr.org

Special things today to Alan viard who we talk to Annie

There's no way to stop

460
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,583
What the podcast is this just goes after 20 minutes they were like

461
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,143
Put it out of the Realtors Nautilus switch

462
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,447
Well it'll stop when when the wind

463
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,079
A little latch

464
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
I know music box works

465
