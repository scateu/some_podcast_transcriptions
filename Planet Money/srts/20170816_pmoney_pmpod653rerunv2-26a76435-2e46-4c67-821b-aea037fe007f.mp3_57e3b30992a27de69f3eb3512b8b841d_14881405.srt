00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,712
Cheers the show

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,016
You don't seem like a good idea

9
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,832
Skyrim Robert Price thought

10
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,624
Where do stores get their

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,160
What is it was a store

12
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
Force

13
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
Stores

14
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:32,768
A place where people who own little Bodega

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
Small automotive shop could come and buy the stuff they needed

16
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,656
Sir Robert Bryson is Dad rented a warehouse

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,936
House in this industrial parts

18
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,032
We went in there there were birds flying around pigeons and

19
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,104
It was a god-awful looking place but we cleaned it up

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,920
They decided to be allowed to shop at their store for stores

21
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,712
One you had to own a business

22
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,016
Until you had to pay a membership

23
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,552
How to make $25

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,112
For the right to shop which was not really done at

25
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,928
It open for business on July 12th 1970

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,208
And it was a

27
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
The small businesses

28
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,024
Didn't come

29
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,816
They didn't spend money

30
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:07,840
And

31
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
We are after

32
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,936
Relatively short time maybe a few weeks

33
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
Where

34
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
Basically going going bankrupt

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
How did you feel at that moment

36
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,104
Desperate

37
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
My wife and I were a month away from Mars

38
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
II

39
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
Child being born

40
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,064
I remember my mother-in-law in particular figurine

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
She wasn't sure that

42
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,160
That her daughter had married the right person

43
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
Prince had a rough

44
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
Anja

45
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,768
It was really bad

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
Not long after the store open somebody suggested

47
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,400
Opening up the store to people who did not own

48
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,448
People just want to shop for themselves

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,776
The price was afraid that it would alienate the business owners who were they

50
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
Members of this club

51
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
I figured it out

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
Business owners are really going for this anyway so let's

53
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,504
All of a sudden they were people they were shopping and there was

54
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,552
There was excitement in

55
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
It's felt like

56
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
Like we have been

57
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,024
Just giving some kind of a gift I made it was amazing my father said you know

58
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
I think you guys

59
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,864
Are going to end up having a pretty good business here

60
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
You may have heard of it

61
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
The warehouse door was called Price Club which

62
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,984
I never knew was named after

63
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
Robert price

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
Yeah Robert pricing is dead

65
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,640
And so you know they thought it was just going to be this one warehouse but they added more stores and more

66
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,200
A few hours later one of their employees left

67
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,760
Start another Warehouse Club store Costco

68
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Benfleet gym cost

69
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,904
Jim sinegal but he did work at Price Club

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
He did leave and start Costco

71
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,024
Eventually Price Club and Costco merged other Warehouse Club

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,352
Basically copying Price Club popped up all over the world

73
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,656
And you know this thing Robert price

74
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
Stumbled into Exeter

75
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,544
Is paying in order to shopping a huge Warehouse did he give a huge economic Forest today

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,128
Costco alone sells more stuff every year than am

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
By far

78
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,248
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Jacob

Robert Smith

80
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,112
Used to be pure at a store if you wanted to make it easy for your customers

81
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
Price Club and Costco

82
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
Went in the opposite direction

83
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
They need shopping

84
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,072
Harder they make shopping almost unpleasant you hated and people couldn't get it up

85
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,912
Today on the show how Price Club and its imitators change the way we shop

86
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
And how do companies taking what price Club started

87
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Too unbelievable

88
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544

Number one

105
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,928
If you can have a store have a convenient location

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,208
Advertisers

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,024
Tell people where it is and how they can shop there

108
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
And when they come

109
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,071
Welcoming into the

110
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Store

111
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:20,607
And then

112
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
My membership expired and also I don't have my card so I need to renew it and I guess

113
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,711
Carter you don't have the membership anymore I don't

114
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
The founder of a price look like

115
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
What was he thinking when he set up a story

116
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,623
Buy original kind of

117
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Image of my mind

118
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,767
Was like a speakeasy where somebody would feel G I've got this special deal

119
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:54,143
And I can come in and shop and most people can't come in and get in here like truly like

120
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,471
Club o I'm a member of this like insiders Club

121
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
Exactly right

122
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,079
Insiders club for like a hundred million people

123
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,151
But still for each of those hundred million people there is a dude

124
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,247
At the door who says show me your membership card where in

125
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:16,415
So amazing to be a member here you just sign up for membership just renew your membership I just paid $55 for the privilege

126
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
Shopping at Costco

127
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
At this point

128
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
With your in the hole

129
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
Like you've lost money I'm down

130
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,399
The more I spend

131
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,191
Just to through TV

132
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,103
Turn TV as one of those things that nobody actually wants that much I'm sorry Jacob I got totally distracted

133
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,127
Behind the curve

134
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
TV you were about to say

135
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,295
Tell you about the day I paid my 55 bucks now I feel like I got to spend enough money so that I save

136
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
More than 50

137
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
Which I know is irrational I know this is

138
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,927
The sunk cost fallacy tok

139
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
Alta 55

140
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,279
So yeah making you pay to shop

141
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,887
Is this one big thing that Costco does that's the opposite of how normal stores

142
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,031
But once they locked you into this system they can do all of these weird secret things

143
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,335
They wouldn't fly in any other store but in

144
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,615
Costco can get you the Bible

145
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
I need Ziploc bags

146
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,991
Normal store

147
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
You will look at the sign at the end of the aisle

148
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
What's a ziplock bag

149
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
There are no side

150
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,975
There are no signs but why wouldn't you put aside like it makes no sense

151
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
Is Robert price

152
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,167
I was adamant that we would not have signed telling people where things were because

153
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:36,543
That would make it likely that they would wander through all the aisles and find other things to buy

154
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
That's a little bit

155
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
Doesn't feel like you're looking out for me

156
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,759
No I mean I agree with you I think it was I think I know what I do use the word devious

157
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
But it was a manipulative

158
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
Because it creates this whole

159
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
Different philosophy of shopping it is not

160
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,207
The kind of story you just pop into and grab a Cuppa

161
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Little Things

162
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,303
You go down every aisle and if you buy something

163
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
You buy a lot of it

164
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:06,239
Churches the good call I like the characters, I don't know you normally

165
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:11,103
It's probably costing me more because I just bought 13 gallons of carrot juice

166
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,431
Never having drink carrot juice before my I'll buy one of those

167
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,503
And it'll Cordia buying in bulk is always

168
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,647
But for Robert Price the bulk stuff fit into this broader really surprising plan

169
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,463
Yeah we didn't want people to come very often

170
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
Tell me more that's

171
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,535
Why not

172
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:35,679
Because it was better it's much better from a cost expense point of view is to have people come less often and buy more

173
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
Sitting down

174
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,847
In planning ways to have people not come to their store and there's like math behind the right because

175
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,383
Every time you go to a store

176
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
That's where he has to pay for your parking

177
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,759
Has to pay for the cashier to make change or two

178
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Authorized user credit

179
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Right if you're the store

180
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
You would rather have a customer who comes say

181
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,159
Once a month

182
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
Taunton spends $400

183
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,743
Person comes every week

184
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,815
And spends $100

185
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
Now weird Ziploc

186
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,471
In a normal store they would be like 15 kinds of bags

187
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:14,079
Sizes different brands the ones of a little zip-top on the blue thing on it

188
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Not

189
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,455
We got three choices and three choices on one

190
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
Small medium large

191
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:24,831
Costco Giant Store tiny selection

192
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,879
Any idea is

193
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
When you have more selection

194
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,207
There's more labor

195
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,255
You going to a grocery store

196
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
And you see everything is headstack

197
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
Everything is being touched

198
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
In other words

199
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,471
The wave grocery store gets those 15 kinds of Ziploc bags onto the Shelf

200
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,543
They pay somebody to put them in one box at a time

201
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,847
But if you're going to Costco and you look at them

202
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,199
Hinckley the grocery department those products are driven by forklifts

203
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,527
So they're not touching individual items they're touching a pallet

204
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
It's just

205
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
Quantum difference on labor

206
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:02,207
Soap toys for the Ziplocs at Costco small medium large I went with the small

207
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
We went to check out

208
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
It was that one last thing

209
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,583
I went and got a couple of those pinotage weird like half

210
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,983
Cut out boxes they have to put your stuff in yeah I should say that I'm not a regular member of Costco and so it surprises me

211
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Me when I go to store spend

212
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
Where was a $350

213
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,615
And then like yeah you have to put them in these

214
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
Genki

215
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
Little tiny falling apart

216
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,223
To carry them out of the sky

217
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
Yet they don't even give you a real box

218
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
And they definitely do not get

219
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,855
Never had bags

220
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
For two reasons one is

221
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
It cost money to have bags

222
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
And secondly

223
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
This might be a little bit of the

224
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Four show

225
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
Idea

226
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,655
But if you have bags you look like a retail store

227
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
Robert Preston

228
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,031
Price Club and Costco never ever want to look

229
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Leica retail

230
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,847
You know they want to be that that's

231
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Speakeasy he was

232
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
Your place

233
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Put the cement floor

234
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,783
Palettes. Where you go to your special club and you buy your

235
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
Bat of carrot juice

236
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,087
For a great

237
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,415
I'm sorry it just makes me laugh every time you say the words

238
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,023
Because it's so clearly not that Vibe it is a cold

239
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Harsh

240
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
Viber every part of the business is busy

241
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,447
I would rather regular grocery store

242
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,519
Take care of all those details for me and I am willing to pay

243
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
A quarter

244
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
$0.30 35

245
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
And I-35 since you mean

246
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Hundreds of dollars a year

247
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
The Costco has basically pushed

248
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,647
This about as far as you could push

249
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
A physical store in

250
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
But a lot of people are looking at the same

251
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
Is there a place

252
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
I can go even further

253
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
Is there a way that you

254
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
Strip away even more of the

255
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
The comfort of traditional

256
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Of course there is

257
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,983
And will tell you about it

258
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
After the break

259
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:56,639
Support for this podcast in the following message come from the Annie E Casey Foundation

260
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,223
Developing solutions to support strong families and communities

261
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,551
To help ensure a brighter future for America's children

262
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,135
More information is available at aecf. Org

263
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,999
Price Club and ultimately Costco became really successful because they

264
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,559
Strip down physical retail as far as they

265
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
A few years ago

266
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
A company launched that in way

267
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
Is taking things even

268
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,703
The company is called

269
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,471
Jet

270
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
And in a lot of ways it's like Costco

271
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
But online

272
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
I found the company fascinating because it took this

273
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,687
Deconstructing idea that Costco had

274
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
To remove all the artist

275
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
Of retail

276
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
I just took it to the next level

277
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,111
Mark Laurie who started the company he told me what that next level

278
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
They built this

279
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
The system

280
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,743
The tracks millions of products scattered and warehouses all over the country

281
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
And that's all the song

282
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
It's really

283
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,583
Basic problem in econ

284
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,911
Mercury says when we buy stuff online

285
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Even if we don't know it

286
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
We are getting killed on ship

287
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,311
You're buying something online for $100

288
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,359
20 of that is just

289
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
D battery cost

290
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
To cover shipping and fulfillment

291
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,711
Even if you get free shipping is already embedded in

292
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Surprise

293
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,527
So you telling me

294
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,343
I get my Amazon Prime I get free shipping if not

295
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
Stop right now

296
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
It's embedded

297
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
Embedded in the price

298
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,535
Lori's big idea Jets big idea is to solve that

299
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,839
Lori showed me on his phone

300
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
Let's buy some stuff

301
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
So I pulled up the jet

302
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,823
App and his a homepage let's pick a category associate

303
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
So this is

304
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,943
One of the most populous is the Tide Pods laundry detergent

305
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
If we just by the ton

306
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,783
Somebody in a warehouse has to get that tied up

307
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
The Shelf

308
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,623
Put together a box put it in the Box tape up the box

309
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,975
And then somebody from UPS or whatever has to bring that box all the way to my house

310
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
That is not efficient that is expensive

311
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,863
Lori says the way to solve that problem is to get us to buy

312
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,887
Lots of stuff

313
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
All at once

314
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
From the same way

315
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
We do that

316
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
The shipping cost per item goes Wei Wei

317
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
Subject is basically set up

318
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,359
To say

319
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,199
Oh you get that box of Tide well there's some handy wipes over here you want those

320
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:11,039
What is what that and because this is like e-commerce giant warehouses

321
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
They're like

322
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
Thousands of things

323
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
In the same warehouses with

324
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,487
The Tide Pods laundry detergent

325
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,071
And you can see there it says savings just increased on

326
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,887
25717 item

327
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,239
That means that that particular product is located

328
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,775
In warehouses

329
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,335
That give access to another 25,000 Prada

330
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,895
So I feel like I haven't Costco where

331
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
This is all just too much

332
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,735
Information about how things work in the warehouse

333
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
This doubles and triples that idea because now it's like do I really want

334
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
Your house and how I can save a couple

335
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
I'm going to give you one more

336
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
You got one more thing to worry about

337
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
You see it when you go to check out

338
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,143
Okay so here so so here's the tide and I wasn't able at the time

339
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,727
It says wave return and Save $0.24

340
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
And there's a little little button exercise

341
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
Tokyo

342
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
Bissell push that button you'll save $0.24

343
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Additional annual

344
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,759
Robert jet offers free returns like a lot of side

345
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
But they tell you

346
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
Free returns are not free

347
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
The right to return this box

348
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
Tide is worth

349
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
$0.24

350
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,767
Give up that right and Jet will give you the money don't give you that $24

351
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
I just

352
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:30,143
Don't want to know that much about the grocery business it is not worth it

353
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Tumi

354
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
To save 20%

355
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
I kind of love it

356
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,543
The kind of love it like it's

357
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
Like I feel like I'm doing work and I'm

358
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
Saving money you know it's like

359
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
Bike tire looks like

360
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Puttering around the house

361
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,831
There's a logical limit to how much work a consumer can do

362
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
I don't think we've hit that limit yet

363
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:58,047
So we first ran the show back

364
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
In 2015

365
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,143
Last year in 2016

366
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
Jet was acquired by Walmart

367
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,239
