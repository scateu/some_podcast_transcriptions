00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,168
To printing to mailbox

7
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,472
And instead of closing this Memorial Day we

8
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,008
May 24th and 20

9
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,288
The UPS Store

He's doing another thing

11
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
All together

12
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,104
Opening

Everything for small business

15
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,712
And of course shipping

16
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,272
Hey Scott it's Dan Charles

17
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040
Hey Dan

18
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,064
How are you

19
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:27,392
I'm doing fine I'm in Washington DC Scott flake

20
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,928
Is in Sacramento California

21
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,488
What's the what's it like out there in Sacramento

22
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
Today just weather wise

23
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
Beautiful sunny day clear skies

24
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
And warming up

25
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,680
Scotts Valley forecasting business he is in

26
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
The energy

27
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,984
So sunlight to Hannah's mom

28
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
Take a look at this website

29
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:48,128
Here's a chart showing where California is getting its electricity right at this moment

30
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
Bichos nuclear plants

31
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968
Gas burning plants hydroelectric

32
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
Dams

33
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,320
There's a chart with different colored lines showing Renewable Power

34
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,112
There's wind geothermal

35
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:58,880
There's Biomat

36
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,440
What's leave lines are pretty flat

37
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,000
Except for one song about the mall is a bright

38
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
Golden Lion

39
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,304
That is solar power

40
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
This is an incredible

41
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Chart

42
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,888
This solar curve

43
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,704
You like it it's like this mountain

44
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,752
Suddenly appears in the middle of the day

45
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,360
Starting about 6 this morning when the sun came up it really started ramping up quickly

46
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:23,456
It goes from 0 to like where are we right now

47
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,272
Just over ten thousand megawatts

48
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,624
Which is almost half of all the electricity that California is using right

49
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
It's pretty incredible

50
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:35,488
And just as incredible what that sunlight is doing to be price

51
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:39,840
Of electricity right now here I can see what utilities are paying for electricity

52
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,912
A dozen different places across the state minute by me

53
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,216
Sometimes it's expensive

54
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,240
But there are times

55
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
Especially on weekends when people are not using much electricity

56
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,408
This flood of solar energy does really weird things to those prices

57
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
Often times UK

58
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,456
Have

59
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
Moore Supply of energy

60
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
Then demand

61
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,856
And so what happens is the lot of those price

62
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
Start to show up as

63
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Negative numbers

64
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Negative

65
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,280
Right so how can there be negative prices what does that mean

66
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
What would it be

67
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,352
People don't need that much energy

68
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,936
And if electricity is worth less than nothing the power company

69
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,336
He's other people to use the power to take it off the grid attic full of junk you'll pay somebody to

70
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
To get rid of

71
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,968
And there is even more solar power on the way the law in California demands

72
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,760
Companies are building vast

73
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Solar arrays cover

74
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Thousands of Acres

75
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
The California is Desert

76
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,392
When you first came to us with a story dad

77
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
I thought

78
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,208
This is really

79
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:38,976
News to me

80
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,560
That was in our lifetime California will have the source of energy that is

81
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Safe

82
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,632
And renewable that can run everything in the state

83
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Until

84
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
The sun goes down

85
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Until the sun goes

86
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,312
And this is always been the solar energy

87
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,640
You build up the solar cells you run out of transmission line

88
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
And then the sunset

89
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,992
How to breed a Ghazt

90
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,272
Powered generators

91
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,624
Just to keep your lights on which is why the biggest question energy right now

92
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,464
Is a way to store all that beautiful solar energy solve this

93
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,024
Problem and you are well on your way to solving Global warm

94
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,584
And all you need is a battery

95
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
They can follow the Sun

96
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,032
LOL, Planet Money on Robert Charles today on the show I visit the biggest battery in the world

97
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,360
A technology so old it's almost forgotten

98
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
It may save the planet

99
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
But it does involve moving map

100
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,296

We're going to begin with some high school physics and like any good high school physics teachers we've got props

115
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
We've got metaphors

116
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
And we're going to use

117
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Now when the Sun hits

118
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
Solar cell

119
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,416
It starts electrons moving in a wire

120
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
The more light

121
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,976
The more electrons

122
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
Look that way

123
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,095
The wires come together the flow of electricity becomes a mighty River

124
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
Andy Kim power

California treasurer

131
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,455
But the way the electrical grid works is you have to use the

132
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
The power as

133
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,063
There are very few ways to store up electricity and use it later

134
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
So how

135
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
What do you catch

136
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
We called up one of the largest electricity companies in

137
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
In California PG&E

138
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
Pacific Gas and

139
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,071
Arrange to talk with a Senior Vice-President there

140
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351

PR guy who accidentally got dropped off the

142
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,263
I'm in trouble now I'm not supposed to do these interviews without lye

143
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:04,895
Communications Department obvious place to store

144
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
When we use everyday

145
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:13,087
Are you familiar with that Lithium-ion batteries yes battery is you're probably using one of your phone right

146
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:17,695
Right now in fact in California you may have charged your phone of electricity from the Sun

147
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
In-N-Out

148
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,231
Storing

149
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Solar energy

150
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
In your pocket

151
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,167
PG&E is thinking of the same thing right now we are in the process of purchasing

152
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
A lot of battery storage

153
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,775
Big ones that are the size of trailers lined up in a parking

154
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Imagine

155
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
1000

156
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,359
Elon Musk speech with a

157
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,151
1000 of the giant batteries

158
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
He's building Outlet

159
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,503
This problems too big even for Elon Musk PG&E is talking

160
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,271
Him and

161
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
And 5 other battery

162
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
There is a slight problem here

163
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
If you remember at the beginning we found out how much

164
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
Kassidi the sun is producing

165
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
Right now in the middle of the day in Calif

166
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,047
Just over 10000 megawatt

167
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
All those big batteries at

168
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
But they are all built five years from now

169
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
They'll capture maybe one purse

170
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,031
Percent of the amount of electricity that California will need to store.

171
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,847
Someone is looking for something

172
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Better

173
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
I think we need to go back to

174
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
Be a little more daring

175
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
No more

176
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,527
Risk-taking says the bed with no

177
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,295
PR person

178
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
Okay so where can you find

179
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
More battery

180
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
Well if you can't

181
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,695
Build that many Big Data

182
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
Maybe you could just find Millions

183
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
The small batteries

184
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,863
I mean we mentioned the iPhone everyone has an iPhone with a little battery in it

185
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
A lot of people have left

186
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
DARCARS

187
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
PG&E is looking into that

188
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,471
The idea is

189
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,031
If you could encourage people to charge up their electric

190
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Cars

191
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
When the sunshine

192
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
When they're at work maybe

193
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:45,247
Then when they put their cars in at home in the evening PG&E could draw on that stored electricity

194
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
4 price

195
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
What does 3/4

196
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
There's great potential

197
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
The very challenging

198
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
We are teachers our own habits

199
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
7 p.m.

200
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,767
I'm probably using the car

201
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Probably a

202
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:01,119
Bad idea to base your entire electrical grid on people getting home from work

203
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
Trip that we are not out of options

204
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,983
Energy is energy

205
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
You don't have to store it in the form of

206
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Chemicals in a

207
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,383
You can convert electricity into something that's literally

208
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
Pent-up physical energy

209
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
Like by teenagers right now in the last week

210
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
Maybe that would work

211
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
Imagine

212
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Compressed air

213
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Compressed air storage is

214
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,415
It's very fascinating

215
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:29,535
Basically when the sun is shining you use all that extra electricity to pump air into big

216
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
Underground Caverns like blowing up a name

217
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
Incredibly strong and mask

218
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
Balloon

219
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
I've got one right here

220
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
And then at sunset

221
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
You open the valve

222
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
At all that super compressed air comes

223
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Was blasting

224
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
I'll get ready for this

225
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
It blows through a turbine

226
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Spins and generate power

227
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
This is not going to work

228
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
Apparently

229
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:17,407
PG&E actually tried this out they got 50 million dollars from the government to blow air into some old gas

230
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
We were able to

231
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Successfully

232
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Drill

233
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
In 2012

234
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,319
Successfully

235
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
Pump Air

236
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
A very high pressure and

237
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,951
The air stayed pressurized

238
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Underground

239
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
But we went a little bit hiccup

240
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Right now

241
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,375
That is not cheap all right

242
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,935
Compressed air to expensive batteries

243
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Too small

244
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
What else you got

245
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
Here's another thing that stores energy

246
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Wheels

247
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,663
We don't know when you pedal really fast on a bike your momentum can carry you for blocks

248
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,479
You can do something similar with something called a

249
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
Flywheel a giant wheel made out of

250
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Really heavy

251
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:00,927
Conservation of angular momentum sure you use the solar electricity to get this

252
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
Giant wheels

253
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Maybe

254
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Giant

255
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
Record player

256
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:13,215
Which radio Studios we happen to have fun if we get this thing moving with our finger

257
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,287
Becomes attorney

258
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
Faster and faster and faster super fast

259
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:30,623
Then when the Sun goes down to record player still spinning at still got momentum slowing just a bit

260
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:37,023
And then later in the evening when everybody

261
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,631
Turns on their TVs that giant Spinning Wheel can drive a generator

262
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Search up very very

263
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
PG&E paid some people to build

264
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
But they were not able to deliver

265
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
They couldn't make it work

266
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,511
Okay so flat flywheels don't work

267
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
What economically

268
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:16,447
Technically I think they actually do ey for the last hundred years we've made a ton of progress

269
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751
I'm storing massive amounts of power

270
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
You have to leave good ideas in theory but

271
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
Scale

272
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,103
Is so incomprehensibly

273
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
The record player

274
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
So large

275
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,199
How do you get the money

276
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
But here's the thing

277
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,319
Scotland font both of them they think there is a way to

278
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,647
That's when I got them talking about their dream way to store Electra

279
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,999
They started talking about a technology that's not some hot new invention

280
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
It's actually old

281
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
It's so old some people write it off

282
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
Relic of an earlier age but this is big

283
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
It is bold

284
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
It's hidden in the Hills robbery

285
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,823
And I'm sure you're going to tell us what it is Robert after the break

286
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
I'm going to visit the

287
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
The biggest battery in the world

288
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,807
And it's made out of water

289
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
Support also comes from Fidelity Investment

The biggest battery in the world is a giant Lake

298
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:39,135
Tucked away in the Appalachian Mountains on the border between Virginia and West Virginia

299
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:45,535
Ghibli beautiful driving into this place we're driving down through this Valley a region

300
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
Green on either side blue sky above grass seed

301
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
Meadows with cows grazing on them it is just idyllic hear you listening to travels

302
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
With them

303
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
The number to insomnia podcast on iTunes

304
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
See what it was kind of

305
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:08,319
Until you get close and suddenly I see these huge electrical transmission lines

306
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
And then there's a sign Dominion Energy

307
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
A gate

308
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
A guard house

309
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
Is empty but there's a

310
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
Do not skimp on the sound effects

311
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
I can picture it

312
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Close the door

313
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Sleep with door open

314
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,079
Hi my name is Dan Charles

315
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,151
So when we can do is open the gate for you

316
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,967
Okay okay

317
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,759
All right

318
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
One more mile

319
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
Okay got it

320
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
Okay thank you so much

321
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,047
I drive over the hill and realize it's actually a damn and there is the link

322
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,583
It feels this whole valley

323
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
500 Acres of blue water

324
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,911
And this is it

325
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
Well close

326
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
There is a windowless concrete building

327
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Right on the shore of the

328
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,639
I go inside meet Sean Fridley the station director we getting an elevator

329
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
We're going down down into the ground

330
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Basically

331
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Send it

332
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,111
Reynolds on one side and we got the lower reservoir on our other side

333
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
On the east side

334
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
So we will be well under water

335
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
We arrived at the Beating Heart of it

336
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:28,703
6 Motors the size of carousels lined up in a row in a cavernous Hall we're looking down on top of it

337
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
But those are

338
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
These are pumps

339
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:35,871
They're pumping water from that Lake I saw up at through tunnels in the mountains

340
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,175
Huge tunnels big enough to drive cars

341
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,271
Into a valley up above us where there's another damn

342
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,159
The water from this lower leg goes up up up and makes a new Lake way up there and the water has to go up 12 ft

343
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
Close to 1200 that is correct

344
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,535
Start thinking last night that's the height of the Empire State Building

345
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Is it

346
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,167
You seem kind of nonchalant about it it's a massive project

347
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
To all that one

348
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
Stuart high high high above

349
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,775
Forest Lake mattress store

350
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
That's right

351
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,127
We went up there if it just sitting there ready for when people

352
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
Turn on the air-conditioning I need more power

353
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:15,295
At that point the open a valve and millions of tons of water will rush back down through those two

354
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
Back down to those Motors

355
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
Which become generator

356
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,415
Instead of pumps

357
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
They spend the other way generating electricity

358
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
Sending power

359
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
Out to the country sole

360
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,607
It seems awfully peaceful to have that much power tied up in

361
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,215
It's the mountain of power and the quiet giant is

362
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
Some of the terminology we've used every

363
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,311
That's real isn't it I mean

364
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,383
Cities worth of

365
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,407
Power

366
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Just waiting here

367
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
That's correct

368
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,015
An hour later and we're back at that concrete building

369
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
And a call comes

370
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
At the East Coast

371
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Needs more electricity

372
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:56,255
California jokes we need East Coast uses of Power are they need electricity to over culpa

373
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
Podcast startup office

374
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
Fire up the sun tanning beds

It's time to unleash the quiet Giant

377
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
The mountain

378
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
The power

379
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,591
OverWatch things as they happen and I'll try to talk loud

380
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,639
Explain a little bit slow meatballs

381
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,455
Water hits the auxiliary just came on

382
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:21,343
You can actually see the water but you can hear it you can actually feel it

383
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
The whole place is vibrating

384
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,975
It's an adrenaline rush being so close to so much raw Force

385
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:33,887
Scary actually starting to turn a little bit

386
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,191
The vertical shaft in front of me

387
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
4 feet in diameter starts to rotate

388
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,895
Slowly at first then faster faster

389
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,551
500 megawatts of electricity from this one machine are flowing through wires up and down the east

390
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
East Coast

391
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,183
Don't mean I'm just plugging in my phone to get a little busy Mountain Power

392
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
I've done the calculation

393
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
That late can store enough electricity to keep

394
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
Keep your iPhone running for

395
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
8 million year

396
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
I totally use that

397
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
I can do that

398
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,983
When all six of these generators are operating the bath County pump

399
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,263
Storage station is one of the

400
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
The 10 biggest

401
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
Power plants in

402
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,175
And it's been doing this for 30 years pumping water up the mountain releasing the power

403
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,503
But you know physically you got to lose some energy into

404
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Still processing

405
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,063
How to get up to get down

406
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
Get down you lose about 20

407
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,439
Sad that's similar to what you losing those big batteries we were talking to

408
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,767
Bath county is the biggest plant like this in the world

409
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
But there are lots of other

410
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
Doesn't

411
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,167
In the US they were mainly built to store electricity from Nuclear Power Plant

412
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,983
The thing to clear plants they run day and night

413
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,055
And people thought we have all this electricity at night

414
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Let's find a way to store it

415
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
So is this

416
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
The solution

417
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,687
Is this the thing we can build

418
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
Pastora Soler letra

419
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:57,343
Remember Scott Blake the guy at the beginning of the show showing me the graph of solar energy

420
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,159
He first learned about these big water batteries

421
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
15 years ago any work for the Sacramento municipal

422
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
What Utility District

423
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
And he was hooked

424
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
What caught my imagination was

425
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,863
This is a technology that could

426
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Really

427
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
This idea of renewable energy forward

428
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
Scottsdale independent

429
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:19,615
Consultant and he is working on plans to build the first big new pumped storage plant in the United States

430
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
In 30 years

431
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
There are a couple of

432
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Mission projects

433
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,271
I want to send to Southern California that uses an existing

434
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
Reservoir for water supply Down by San Diego

435
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:34,719
There's also a proposal to use an abandoned iron mine also in Southern California has two huge open-pit

436
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
It's one higher than the other

437
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
Another company wants to build one Oregon

438
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:43,167
Which sounds promising but I have to think that especially in California

439
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:48,287
Barely build a Condo building without people objecting it's this idea that you're going to

440
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Be able to do

441
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
Feeling some

442
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
Dolly up

443
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,663
Gorgeous beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains

444
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,759
And you're not going to get a thousand VAR Mentalist chaining themselves to the gate

445
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,063
To stop it from happening it just it just doesn't

446
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Feel like

447
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
You can do this

448
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,231
And that's all true but a couple of things first there is a huge economic incentive to make this happen

449
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,559
Electricity prices in California already are

450
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,887
Three times higher in the evening as they are at noon

451
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,703
Think of all the money you can make if you could store that power

452
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Buy it at noon when it's cheap

453
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
Sell it in the evening when it's

454
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
Expensive

455
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:23,871
And the second thing is yes there are environmental objections to

456
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
Do these projects

457
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:30,015
But think of the environmental opportunity to imagine if in 20 years California could take

458
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
Exist just on solar power

459
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,111
Until the power alone so shut down the fossil fuel

460
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,183
To make that happen you may have to do things that are this big

461
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
And this ambitious

462
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
And then you told us that

463
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
They're actually trying to build one of these

464
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
News in China right now

465
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,631
Yeah China is building one it'll be the world's largest

466
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
Pumped storage plant

467
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
Two dams up in the mountains

468
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
Just like Bath County

469
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
When it's done that plant I visited

470
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,103
Will then be the second largest pump storage plant in the world

471
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,663
No shame in being the second

472
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
Highest mountain

473
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,599
Where was looking for more stories about how the world works

474
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Ashley

475
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
Starbucks Ward am somewhere

476
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,743
Let us know about him email us at Planet Money at npr dot O r g

477
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:18,143
WE Post every show on Facebook and we're on Twitter and Instagram at Planet Money today's episode was produced by Nick fountain

478
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
Our editors brighter set

479
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,239
Are supervising producers Alex gold bar

480
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:28,127
Special thanks to Mario Fitness and David kleiner md Charles

481
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
Next time

482
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Time travels with the

483
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
You know what's amazing to think about is we are in kind of an isolated Valley

484
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:51,167
On the Far Western Edge of Virginia right next to the West Virginia border

485
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:57,567
It's really Backcountry here and it's beautiful driving on this little Country Road overlooking back

486
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:03,967
Creek and this and Back Creek you know is is the the fuel I mean

487
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:10,367
Back Creek is leading us to an energy storage facility that they put here you know because

488
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:16,767
House of the creek in because of the valley and then this electrical storage facility it's Supply

489
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Flying energy all the way to New York City all the way down to North Carolina and ultimately

490
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:29,567
Electrical grids are interconnected it's part of the national Energy System it's it's it's the

491
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,967
It is what it is it's a big piece of a network that spans the country

492
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:42,367
A little dog curious dog in the yard I mean

493
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:48,767
I'm really excited but you know it feels like I shouldn't I should be cool I should be, you know

494
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:55,167
Journalistically jaded but it's kind of an amazing thing
