1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04,864
Hey just a quick note Today Show is a rerun it originally ran in 2004

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:10,240
Robert the couple days ago you and I went to the grocery store in Brooklyn to

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,264
Do that thing

4
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:12,800
Yeah

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:17,408
Do we have a giant pile of watermelons is a classic seen in any grocery store

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
What are you looking for the chicken

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Yeah we don't know

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
Sorry

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,832
Associate

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,624
Pickup on 101

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,184
Alright one more time

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,208
So we got

13
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,488
Cardboard box

14
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:35,584
Full of water. This is a classic summer scene where the watermelons come in

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,864
They will them in

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
The middle of the store

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,216
I don't give a s*** about the watermelon

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,264
Is the palette that there

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,312
Pallet

20
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:48,384
Those big wooden things that just about everything in the world

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,152
Get shipped on

22
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
Cutting watermelon

23
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,224
Including everything else you buy it

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,992
At the grocery store

25
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,296
Certain things in this world are hard to

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,856
You know the classic example.

27
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:01,184
Trap but we're talking about it and we were like the paper

28
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,976
The paperclip

29
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,512
Is 1 wire

30
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
Benton to

31
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,144
Paper clip shape it's so perfect the shape is named after the update

32
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,704
And the super sized version of this

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Perfect object

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
The palette

35
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,848
It's 15 or so pieces of cheap Lumber nailed together

36
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,176
It's not an extra piece of wood or an extra nail in the whole thing

37
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,504
Keep stuff a few inches off the floor works with a forklift

38
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Amazing

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,064
This perfect

40
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,928
Perfect system of moving stuff around a pallet has been around for a long time

41
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,232
Basically for 50 years

42
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
No one improve.

43
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
Until

44
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
Until they did hello about the planet money on Robertson

45
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
And I'm taking cold

46
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,520
Today on the show

47
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,568
Yes you can build a better Palace

48
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
It's not high tech

49
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
It's not computerized

50
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,480
But someone came up with a way to completely rethink an object

51
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
But no one

52
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
Even knew needed

53
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Support for this podcast

54
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
In the following message

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,928

Developing solution

57
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,512
Support strong families and communities

58
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,840
To help ensure a brighter future for America's children

59
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,424
More information is available at aecf. Org

60
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,544
This is not going to come as a surprise to you but we are going to bring you deep inside

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,568
The pallet world

62
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,848
Because of course there's a

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Right

64
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Invisible

65
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,736
We only see the piles of old pallets

66
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Out behind

67
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
Supermarket

68
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
Under the kitchen watermelon

69
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
But there are billions of

70
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
Pallets moving around the world

71
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
And there's old magazines

72
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
It's called modern Material Handling

73
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,096
Unfortunately they changed the original name which was

74
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
The Palatine

75
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,680
The palletiser I love it it sounds like some sort of

76
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
Logistics Uber

77
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
Superhero

78
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,032
I talked to the editor of this magazine Bob travel

79
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
Working Families palette

80
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
Was just out of college

81
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,408
My I guess my most notable a

82
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
She went with nailing a Runner 2

83
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
Ouch

84
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,808
Pallets are cheap

85
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
And easy to me

86
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
Anyone could do it

87
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,160
You could probably build a pallet

88
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,488
If a kind of classic thing that you know some Factory somewhere would put out

89
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
Million of them a day but

90
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
What tablets are actually

91
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
Unique

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
Object in that they are both cheap

93
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,656
But they are big

94
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,192
Mer bulky and there

95
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,752
Heavy and it doesn't make economic sense

96
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,848
The makeup palette in some central location and ship empty pallets all around the country

97
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,688
The truck says a pallet industry grew up as all these

98
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,456
Tiny

99
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Little pouch

100
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,040
But you have a lot of two men and a dog

101
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,344
Piano guys who made pallets in their garage

102
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,368
After work

103
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,512
So you know Joe at the plant buy pallets from his buddy bill and his buddy Dave who built them in their garage

104
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,304
There are still a lot of shops like

105
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,912
My name is Steve Mazza we're at S&B pallet which is a local pallet recycling

106
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,264
I need the s in S & B L I N D S & S M okay

107
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
S&B pallet is in Plainfield

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
It is more than two guys and a dog

109
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
About 70

110
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,760
It's down the block from Geno's truck and Tire maintenance across the

111
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
The street from this neighborhood with houses in

112
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
Countries in Philly

113
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
It looks like it could be any town

114
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Because

115
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,208
Physically there is something like this in almost every time

116
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,512
Parents are still this very local business

117
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Don't you pull in here

118
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Park in the dirt parking

119
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
And suddenly you're in this like

120
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,143
Grand Canyon

121
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,935
Where the walls are made of power

122
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Stack

123
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
40

124
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,639
You ever even think I'm constantly thinking what if this mountain the palace next to a spell I might have your kids

125
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,271
Beef out to pretty stable when they're when they're stacked like that

126
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,367
That noise you hear in the background it's a band saw and

127
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
Coming from a big shot

128
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,927
Over in the corner of the yard

129
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,743
S&B doesn't do anything fancy with the pay

130
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:52,095
What what they do is just buying up used pallets for about $3 each

131
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Fixing him up in that shop and then

132
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
Reselling them for about five bucks

133
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:02,335
And the pallets coming through this conveyor long and then what happened

134
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
I worked

135
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,735
The guys at work tables taking powered off and inspect

136
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,551
Stop and inspect the bottom for any broken boards loose

137
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:17,951
Or just there's debris and everything else that Palace repair to fix a broken board to the new Bora Bora.

138
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
This is

139
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
Clearly in low-tech operation

140
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,863
The guys working here using nail guns and just even regular ham

141
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,167
I can hear it I mean but of course it's low-tech

142
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
I mean

143
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,519
Poets write these guys are making basically the same thing

144
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
The people have been making for

145
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
For decades

146
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
Early part of the 20th century

147
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
I think you could have made it

148
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,711
5000 years ago

149
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,271
The only reason pallets weren't invented even earlier

150
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
Is xXx really need them

151
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Until they had

152
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,623
Forklifts they sort of evolved together

153
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
Really just has

154
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Two jobs

155
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
1

156
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
Old stuff off the ground

157
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
+ 2

158
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,327
Make it easy for forklifts to pick that stuff up

159
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
And so you know decade after decade

160
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
Things don't change that much

161
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,495
The standard pallet becomes an essential part of World Trade

162
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,895
American GI is dragging around the globe in World War II and Steve mother's all over the country are running their lip

163
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
Little pallet businesses all making basically the same kind of power

164
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
Now over the years

165
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,271
Lots of adventure

166
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
Try to make it better

167
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
Try different configurations

168
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
Materials

169
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Pallet

170
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,975
How do you write this is how most products improve

171
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
New technology

172
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
But this did not work with

173
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,863
Because think about a better palate

174
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
Would be a more

175
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
Expensive

176
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
And companies don't want a more expensive palette

177
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
They want a cheap

178
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
Disposable thing that'll pull dare

179
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,335
Whatever case of the toilet

180
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,175
Yeah and we were talking at the pallet World in a more expensive

181
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223
Pallet turns that whole world

182
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,247
On the 10th

183
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,343
Toss them in the back of the store right there expensive if you have two people to

184
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,487
To guard them you have to make sure no one throws pallets away definitely college kids don't steal your palette

185
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
Make the world's ugliest coffee table

186
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
Soap pallets

187
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
Hinder stay the same forever

188
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
Until the blue one

189
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
Yes the blue one

190
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,519
Back in the 1990's in yards and in the back of store

191
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,079
You would all the sudden see a bright

192
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,359
Blue palette

193
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,455
Most of us wouldn't notice this and if we did notice it we think I'll need

194
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Painted a different color

195
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,015
But Steve Mazza

196
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
The pallet guy from New Jersey

197
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,111
Vividly remembers the first time

198
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
He saw the blue

199
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
He was in Memphis

200
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
For a meeting

201
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,279
With a meeting of the national wooden pallet and container assoc

202
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
And he went out to visit a local pallet yard

203
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,631
Because I guess

204
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:37,215
That is what you do when you're at a Palace Convention and you have a few hours off

205
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,311
I actually went to a pallet yard and I said hey that's one of those blue Palace

206
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,407
Can I have that and he said sure I took that blue palette knife

207
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:52,319
We were having a general session for an association meeting and I walked into that General Session I put a pallet of my head I slammed it down on the floor

208
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,343
Lauren I said you know what guy

209
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:58,463
Everybody better understand what that pallet over there is because it's not just a pallet

210
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
It's the end of our endless

211
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,559
These blue pallets were all coming from one cup

212
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
A company called check

213
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
Caahep

214
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,751
Chop and this company is coming it will change the American pallet Market forever

215
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
What's from Australia

216
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,663
Quick backstory here when the US Army left Australia after the end of World War II

217
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
Left behind

218
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
A lot of pallets

219
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,503
And the Australian government

220
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
Scoop those pallets up informed

221
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,111
The Commonwealth handling equipment pool

222
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
Cheap

223
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Jeff

224
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,487
Chocolate private it got by the international

225
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Conglomerate

226
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,559
And they were intent on turning this

227
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
Really local

228
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
Low-tech pallet business

229
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,423
Into a worldwide in

230
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,031
Chest loot Palace they're still made of wood they're still held together with nails

231
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,079
But they're put together in a different way

232
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
Okay this is going to get a bit

233
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
Nerdy but you are going to be able to impress your friends next time you go to supermarket by knowing

234
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,551
The different kinds

235
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
The palace

236
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Standard pallet

237
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
Is known as a Stringer

238
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
The kind of Steve Mazza

239
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
You can look it up from the front or the back

240
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,071
But you can't we lift up a Stringer pallet from the side because

241
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
There's a vertical bordelon

242
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
The new palette

243
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,167
Called

244
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
A block

245
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
And it's open on all four sides

246
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,311
And that makes it much easier to move around a warehouse

247
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,335
Oreimo stomach

248
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
Stronger

249
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
It's basically better

250
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
But that doesn't mean it was an easy sell

251
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,807
David Lee help wants chips business in this country and

252
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,391
You told me about shopping this new palette around to manufacture

253
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,487
Well obviously the introduction of the block pallet was a major deal

254
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,839
For us there's a skeptical Industries saying well do I really have to handle

255
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
Multiple specifications of pallet

256
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,215
And you have to persuade them of the benefit

257
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
What we know

258
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
You know and love the string of palette

259
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
But but his

260
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
He's a better mousetrap

261
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,919
The black palette had actually been around for a long time

262
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,711
But it wasn't popular

263
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
Because it's really expensive

264
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
Quotes about

Normal palate cause maybe half

267
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,695
How did Shep get customers to buy this luxury palette

268
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
They didn't

269
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,047
This this was actually chips real innovation

270
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Chipset

271
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351

00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
We're going to rent the

273
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
Here's Bob trebilcock

274
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Palette expert

275
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Again

276
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:22,335
My first memory of cap is hearing people talk about this idea of

277
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
We're going to rent

278
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
The pallet that sounded a little crazy

279
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,687
Why would anybody want to run at

280
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
Running out of pallets seems like running out of paper

281
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
Bringing out an aluminum can

282
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
But here's how they sold

283
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,391
If you're saying a toothpaste company

284
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,695
And you want to get your toothpaste from your factory to the

285
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Uphs

286
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Say

287
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
V bucks

288
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
And they let you borrow one of them

289
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,839
Pallet

290
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,935
Then winter toothpaste gets to the grocery store check comes and picks up its pallet

291
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,495
Expect some real support and then rent it out again

292
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,287
Eventually this caught on

293
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,383
In what have been this Ultra local two guys and a dog pallet world

294
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Suddenly there was something

295
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Much bigger

296
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,527
We have something like 78 million circulating

297
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
And in the United States

298
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
78 million pallet

299
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
78 million pallet

300
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,231
But of course now this means that chap

301
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Has to keep

302
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
Track of 78 million power

303
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,399
This is a really hard logistical problem and David Lee says

304
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,959
This is why all the pallets

305
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Are painted blue

306
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,031
So that you can see them from across the sea

307
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,127
We have a nice white logo on the side and a big sign that says

308
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,151
Probably of chat

309
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:34,015
On every single palette so so nobody in the US can say

310
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,575
But I don't know who owns a pallet

311
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
There is

312
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,647
There is even a phone number

313
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
Stenciled on the side

314
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,487
You can call if you find a blue pallet

315
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
That has escaped

316
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
Into the Wild

317
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Yeah they Skype the fold

318
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,935
Escape the family

319
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,847
I think it's in our DNA that we do feel that way but the we all believe but yeah we have a personal responsibility to bring them back

320
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,199
Into the fold the company of contest for workers who find pallets out in in the wild

321
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
David Lee says

322
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
Give me totally found one helping to hold down a bouncy

323
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
County Fair near me

324
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,367
House and now that we have told you

325
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
About the blue pallets

326
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,487
I swear you will start to see these things everywhere I have started

327
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
To see them everywhere

328
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,911
Behind grocery stores holding up the produce in a supermarket and there is one place

329
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:28,543
One place where you are going to go see more pallets than just about any other store on Earth

330
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
Was that after the break

Bling Brooklyn cast

341
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,399
Where in the diaper aisle

342
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,239
I'm just going to run down the line here and look at these Palace on this road

343
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,823
Blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue

344
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,151
Here's back Costco looked at these chep pallets

345
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,295
And they actually they did the math that they look at how long it took them to unload a truck full of chep pallets

346
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,855
Versus how long it took him to unload a truck full of

347
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,623
Full of regular

348
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
And they realized

349
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
With the chep pallets they saved a little bit of

350
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
Of course if your Costco

351
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,119
And you can save a little bit of time on every truck you unload

352
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
That is a big deal

353
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Costco issued this

354
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
They said

355
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
All of their suppliers

356
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,311
When you send us stuff

357
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
Whether it's diapers or

358
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
Peanut butter or whatever

359
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,943
It has to be on a chep pallet

360
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
Or at least on a pallet

361
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
Like a chapter

362
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
There are few exceptions but

363
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,855
If you walk into a Costco today

364
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
Look up at the palace

365
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
You are going to see a lot of blue

366
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,767
That is the thing that is put the fear of God into the paladins

367
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
The Palatine

368
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,095
All those guys building pallets with

369
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
Wood Hammer somewhere in your town

370
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,191
All the guys who go out and recycle old pallets

371
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
Guys like Steve Madden

372
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
Yes

373
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,775
S&B pallets

374
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
The New Jersey

375
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,127
Play mother knows this new chep pallet is a better pallet

376
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
Maybe not surprisingly

377
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
Steve Messer wants to get into the better pallet business

378
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
But there's this big barrier

379
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
Chip has turned what used to be a local business

380
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Into a national

381
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
The complete C Maza would need

382
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
Lots

383
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Of pallets

384
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,839
How many pallets would you have to build to get going at minute every minute

385
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
5 million to 10

386
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,703
Just for 5 million pallets you need a hundred million dollars

387
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,079
109th do you have a hundred-million-dollar don't have a hundred million dollars surprisingly not

388
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
But he is working on

389
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
He's teamed up with a bunch of other pallet

390
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,223
And they're launching this new company

391
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
It's called 9 block

392
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Because

393
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
Extra geeky facts

394
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
There are 9 wood blocks in a box

395
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,927
And 9 black basically wants to be chapped

396
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:58,047
But with more like a local touch and all they need is a hundred million dollars

397
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
In the meantime

398
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,191
Monster in the other little guys are doing what lots of small companies in lots of Industry

399
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
Please do to compete against

400
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
Giant Global competitors

401
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,591
They're figuring out how to do things that the big guys don't do

402
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,455
First deposit that means making specialized pallets for local businesses that say

403
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,759
Ship really heavy things are really big things

404
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,343
Things that can't go on the standard blue chep pallet

405
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
Headed to chat

406
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
For creating this sort of

407
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,743
Excitement in the pallet industry after decades

408
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,047
When you change something so basic

409
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,119
So perfect like it kind of gives everyone this hope

410
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,191
Is there a new things to discover it makes guys in

411
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:40,799
Jersey and Ina yard an industrial neighborhood dream of hundred-million-dollar company

412
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,359
Maybe the booth how old is just the start

413
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Baby

414
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,783
This is the new age of pallet innovation

415
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,183
Banks to Stuart Richardson

416
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:02,047
He wrote pallets a North American perspective and he talked to me for the story

417
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:07,935
I also want to mention that I got interested in pellets because I recently read a great article about

418
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:13,055
