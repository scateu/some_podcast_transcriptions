1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,304
What are things that amazes me about political.

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,376
Is it on one hand the candidates are trying to talk to

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,400
All of America

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,680
How to make this really

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,448
Big

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,728
Simple

7
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,752
Emotional case

8
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:14,336
But then when you're watching the base they bust out all of the

9
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,688
I have never heard of and everybody has to look them up online

10
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,712
Like OMG

11
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
BPM

12
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
Patriation in offshore

13
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,552
The prophets and the Dragon

14
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,600
When have a tremendous income

15
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,696
And the reason I say that is not in a braggadocious way it's because

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,232
It's about time

17
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,048
But this country had somebody running it

18
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,096
That has an idea about money

19
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,144
Pronunciation

20
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
Braggadocious

21
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,704

This was the first time that we really heard Trump use that word

27
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,664
But the root of it

28
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
Bragging

29
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,504

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,808

That is number one and we cannot say that word enough forget about the duchess braggadocious braggadocious braggadocious

You do it yeah number two is carried interest

70
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
This one came up at Monday's debate

71
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:46,656
An interesting Robert because it's actually one of the rare things

72
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump agree on

73
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
How much they hate

74
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
This think All Care dentures

75
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,080
I'm getting rid of the carried-interest provision

76
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
And if you really look it's not a tax but you would not

77
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:02,528
Great thing for the wealthy it's a great thing for middle-class it's a great thing for companies to expand

78
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,136
I feel bad for the people who went out to get a beer can back to the TV set and you're just like what

79
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
Is he talking about

80
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Carried interest

81
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
So I'm going to explain

82
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,304
Will trump and Clinton want to get rid of this loophole

83
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
What's essentially for the

84
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
And the loophole goes by the name Carrie interest

85
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,680
Carried interest provision

86
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,008
I'm going to give you a little word origin story

87
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
He's Economist at the urbanist

88
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
Carried interest comes back from the days of shipping

89
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
Where you would give

90
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
The captain of your ship

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,272
20% of the profit on selling

92
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,624
Right and I give the captain a really good incentive to

93
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
Get the ship

94
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
From point A to point B

95
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,024
And it gives them an incentive to sell the cargo at a good price when he gets

96
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,608
So they had an interest in the things that they carry

97
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,984
Carried interest

98
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
Firms which I get there

99
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
Modern day ships

100
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,104
The managers of private Equity firms

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,872
They take

102
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,152
People's money to invest

103
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
They buy companies they sell them

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
And then these managers

105
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
Just like the old sea captain

106
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
They get a cut

107
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
The profits they get their percentage

108
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
The carried in

109
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
And it's essentially their paycheck

110
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
How they make their living

111
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Thought

112
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
This is the key parts

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,303
They don't pay regular income taxes

114
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
Is carried interest

115
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,143
They pay much lower investment rate

116
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,471
So both Trump and Clinton say that we should get rid of

117
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Call this carried in

118
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,335
We should just tax Rich managers like everybody else

119
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Okay number 3

120
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
Currency manipulation

121
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
Does usually combined in a sentence with another word

122
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,343
China you look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product

123
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,463
They're devaluing their currency and there's nobody in our government to fight them

124
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
Currency manipulation

125
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
That does not sound

126
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
I know it sounds very blue

127
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
Nefarious

128
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,423
Obviously though all it is is 4 years

129
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
China was

130
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,823
Accused of manipulating its currency that you want so that was artificially low compared to the dollar

131
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,663
And what that meant was the Chinese goods were cheaper when they sold

132
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,711
In the US and that made them very

133
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
Competitive for us

134
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
Really hard for us

135
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Companies to compete

136
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
It was hard for them to

137
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
Have prices that would match the prices

138
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
That is

139
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
The currency manipulation that

140
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,047
People were talking about and we're worried about

141
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
So is it still happening now because Trump talk about it

142
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
All the time

143
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Yeah that's

144
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,775
Interesting because most people don't actually think that's happening at all anymore in fact

145
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,079
Anything the reverse is now true

146
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:39,199
China has been trying to kind of prop up that you want and that has made Chinese Goods more

147
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
Expensive in the US than they would

148
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Otherwise be

149
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,087
And has made us Goods cheaper in China than they would have

150
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
All right number for

151
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
Robert this is a word that I hear constantly on

152
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
Manufacturer

153
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,815
As in I want us to invest in your future

154
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,399
That means jobs and infrastructure in advanced Manufacturing

155
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,959
Well the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave

156
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,495
The companies are leaving

157
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:07,615
I could name I mean there are thousands of them they're leaving and they're leaving in bigger numbers and ever

158
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,199
Obviously we all know what the word manufacturing means

159
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
Sit means sit

160
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,503
Large facility to

161
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Mapreduce objects

162
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Smith machine

163
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,623
But, this we know Emily Oster from Brown

164
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
She pointed out that the way

165
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
Both candidates

166
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
Use the word manufacturing May mislead

167
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,351
You would think everyone in America was in

168
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:33,727
We either work in a factory making an air conditioner or we work in a small business making draperies

169
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:38,335
Or you know our job has been as a as a car manufacturers

170
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Bishop doctor mask

171
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
That is the only job

172
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
That people have

173
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
Intersection of the vast

174
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
Majority of us

175
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Make anything

176
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:50,623
We don't process anything we don't run the machines to manufacture and process things

177
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,183
Only 9% of jobs in the US

178
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
Orion manufacturer

179
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Most of us do

180
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,279
What we're doing

181
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,303
Right now I mean

182
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
They're they're podcasting

183
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Keychain

184
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Healthcare

185
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,447
He working retail they're doing something for somebody else

186
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,031
Why not more discussion of improving jobs wages better schedule

187
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
Saturating the service act

188
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
This is where most people work

189
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,151
Well I have a theory about that Robert yep

190
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,711
Politics inherently is aspiration

191
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,831
We talked about and I politicians talk about what we wish things were not what they really are

192
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,159
In so much about the days of manufacture

193
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,511
I seem more American and simpler

194
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,327
And harder you know it's

195
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,679
So much of the service economy we're still figuring out and it's hard to explain and it

196
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Difference

197
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,031
And it doesn't feel as good as

198
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
Going to that good ol Factory job

199
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,431
You know we're talking about that after the debate you know as reporters like we fall into this

200
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Is to casino work

201
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,015
We're fascinated with the closing of Drive-In

202
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
Diners like we always want to do the stories on

203
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,623
Annan Farmers work

204
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
We're so fixated on these

205
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,463
Disappearing parts of America

206
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:04,607
Exactly like you don't see campaign ads about the beauty and american-ness of the emerging service economy you just know

207
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,191
Yeah maybe they should stay in the healthcare worker out into the field of

208
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,519
Greiner as the Sun is setting in the could make it more romantic

209
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Outdoor hats

210
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
Exactly right

211
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,407
Take us to number what number 5

212
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
NAFTA

213
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,247
Okay it's me

214
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
The North American Free Trade Agreement

215
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,623
I

216
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
I'm actually research this a lot

217
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
I hear a lot when I'm on the road

218
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
The more I hear about it

219
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
The more I am

220
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
This is true end end disc

221
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
Kids coming up during the debate and especially

222
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,239
Donald Trump's you have very strong feelings

223
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
NAFTA is the worst

224
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,383
Trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere but certainly ever signed in this country and now

225
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
Yuan to worst

226
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
Deal

227
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,455
Ever

228
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
Ever

229
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,623
Everywhere back to the ancient Greeks the ancient Romans the sink was the Trojan Horse terrible deal

230
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,415
Back to the Garden of Good and Evil

231
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
Eva's like y'all mathas

232
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,071
Write what what NASA did was eliminate these protect

233
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
Do taxes on goods from Canada and Mac

234
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
So it made those things cheaper in the US

235
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
Which made it harder for us come

236
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Pete

237
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,311
Especially since labor costs are so much lower in

238
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
Still though the worst

239
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Steel lever

240
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:21,919
Sounded

241
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,991
Big so I asked Michael Munger about this he's an economy

242
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,087
The claim that NAFTA was a bad deal is

243
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
A very

244
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Narrow

245
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
View

246
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,927
Of what

247
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
Policy should do

248
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:40,607
So the thing that NAFTA mostly did was reduce the prices of products on both sides of the Border

249
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,679
So that was really bad for some us businesses because they

250
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,287
He couldn't compete with the price of goods from Mexico the textile industry took a really big head

251
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,127
But it was good for consumers we could get stuff at a lower price

252
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
Yeah so I talk to my colleague Danielle Court

253
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
She covers

254
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,271
Policy and data for India Palace

255
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,063
And I asked her about nap

256
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,367
The end she says the thing with this deal

257
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,135
Is that

258
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
The good of it was hard to

259
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,463
A lot of the things that you buy

260
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
Got cheaper because of nap

261
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
But you didn't immediately

262
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Thai that

263
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Trade deal

264
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Right but the bad of

265
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Size was very visible

266
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
You know that some factories

267
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
And some jobs

268
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Moved out of

269
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
Compounds to other country

270
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,407
Freight in FX impact on jobs was not as big as what

271
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
People worried that

272
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,991
It would be because our trade with Canada and Mexico

273
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,551
Well significant is still a really small part of

274
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
The US GDP

275
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
Okay I'm going to take number 6 all by myself

276
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
I'll be very quick

277
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,231
It's kind of a pet peeve of mine the TPP

278
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
The trans-pacific partnership

279
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
I do know that you got to Planet Money

280
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
I've handled this one quite a bit

281
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
But I have a small bone to pick

282
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,959
Here's my thing with the way politicians talk about

283
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,031
It's always part of a larger Rift

284
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
About trade

285
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
How the USA

286
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
Preston Trail

287
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
In China this

288
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
TPP that

289
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
And they end up

290
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,991
Lumping TPP together with China

291
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
But here's the thing

292
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
TPP

293
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Does not

294
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
Involve China

295
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,903
Is the trade deal between the US and 11 other nations

296
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
None of which is China

297
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
And the idea is that it gives those Nations and the US

298
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
The upper hand in trade

299
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Against China

300
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
In the region

301
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
So that's it

302
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,191
You can hear more of Planet Money talk about this but

303
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
Alright where are we now

304
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
We are in the T

305
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
In art list

306
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
Moving alarm

307
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Yes we are

308
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:30,687
And so let's let Hillary Clinton take the next term because she made up the

309
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,271
Is joke about how to characterize Donald Trump's plane was a very memorable moment in

310
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
I call it

311
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Trumped-up

312
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,647
Trickle down because that's exactly what it would be

313
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,231
Glass cleaner

314
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Trumped-up trickle-down

315
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
10

316
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
When I get a chance of trickle-down

317
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
Yeah so this is one of those moments was like such a

318
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
Queer sort of

319
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
Quote-unquote zingers

320
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
Underground in there watching it

321
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,919
But Michael Munger The Economist from Duke

322
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,223
Said this was his favorite moment in the

323
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,831
It's both so hokey and yet her sort of smirk as she said it

324
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
It was a kind of pride of authorship

325
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
And the audience reacted well

326
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:18,815
And it did connect to the pad the Republican Pastor the more I thought about it the more I was taken by trumped-up trickle-down

327
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Down economics

328
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,863
The Republican past

329
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,631
The course was

330
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Ronald Reagan

331
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,703
He was big champion of cutting taxes

332
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
For the wealthy

333
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
This is called a trickle down economics bike

334
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,103
The idea is that if you cut taxes for the wealthy

335
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,175
The wealthy will take that money and they will spend it in all kinds of

336
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
They will buy cars

337
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,551
Houses in food Sydney will hire a landscaper as an architect

338
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
Cancel that money will then trickle down throughout the whole

339
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Economy

340
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,951
And Mike Munger says Trump's plan when it comes

341
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
Taxes is

342
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
Quite classic

343
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
In that way

344
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,559
Trump wants to cut taxes

345
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
For the wealthy and Ferb

346
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,679
Businesses and Hillary Clinton was very very vocal about wanting

347
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Increase

348
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
Now this is one of those

349
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Perennial

350
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Debate

351
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,823
Between Democrats and Republicans

352
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Weather

353
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Trickle down economics

354
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
Supply-side as

355
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,431
Blue favorite color

356
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,527
Whether it actually works massive tax cuts have not worked

357
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Previous

358
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Republican

359
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
President

360
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
What is Mike Munger say about

361
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
Trump's

362
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Trickle-down

363
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Trumped-up

364
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
Trumpet Circle

365
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,863
I know I lost my own

366
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Bet

367
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
What Michael Munger is a Libertarian so

368
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
Told me that he actually is not a big fan of either can

369
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
He said this plan that

370
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
The trickle down economics

371
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,943
Plan does work in certain ways

372
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,735
And then also doesn't work

373
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,135
It just depends on where the rate of Taxation is so friend since he told me that income taxes in this country and his appeal

374
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,975
Are so low that if they got cut it would actually not help

375
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
The overall economy

376
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,303
But he said the corporate taxes

377
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
In his opinion are quite

378
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
Either 35%

379
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,911
And if those are cut as

380
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Trump said he

381
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,703
We plan to do

382
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
He thought that actually

383
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
Would help the economy

384
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,543
Trickle down through the rest

385
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,103
To the economy and help to bring companies and jobs back in

386
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,919
Soap for the next term Robert

387
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
You got to say

388
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
Donald Trump uses lots of different words

389
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
To speak highly of himself

390
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,343
It was one that I heard last night

391
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
That

392
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
You don't usually hear

393
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,695
I'm extremely under leveraged

394
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
You got to play it again I deliver

395
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,535
I'm extremely under leveraged

396
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,935
Extreme

397
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:37,823
Show me stupid about you did you did you change your hair and you lose weight are you under leveraged in the debt Department

398
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,943
I was on the under leverage cleanse diet you're looking very leverage list

399
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,967
If I can say that

400
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
Thank you

401
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
So we should play leverage means

402
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,575
Simply you of taking out a loan

403
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
Business

404
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,207
And people who take on too much debt are called over-leveraged

405
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,279
So I think in French - thinking well if over-leveraged

406
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
Is bad

407
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
Then under Leverage is good so

408
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
Essential truck is saying I own

409
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
So much

410
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Stuff

411
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,007
So much stuff that I could take out

412
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
But I I choose not to

413
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
To do so

414
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
And it's funny because like

415
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,431
When you hear

416
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,503
Him say that you realize that Donald Trump spent a lot of

417
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Time

418
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Talking

419
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
Two other rich

420
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
Spends a lot of time in boardroom salon

421
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
Golf courses

422
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
And so a lot of The Debaters

423
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
Explained by the sort of

424
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,255
Medford Spa

425
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
There's one more but I think jumped out

426
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
To all of us here

427
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
You'll hear Hillary Clinton first

428
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,215
Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis

429
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
He said back in 2006

430
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,847
GI I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and

431
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,967
Buy some and make some money well it did collapse

432
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
People

433
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,039
So what is that right there that's called business

434
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:56,671
One of the things that I've noticed about Donald Trump following him over the last few months here and there is that

435
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
He fully believes

436
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
That

437
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
To get the deal you want

438
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,071
It's okay to say whatever you need to

439
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,423
And so people will critique him and say while he contradicts himself

440
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,239
You know he says this one day and then that the other

441
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
That's part of his plan

442
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,359
He relies on exaggeration and hyperbole

443
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
And going there

444
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,663
To get the deal that he want

445
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,479
And he says that that will help him be a great deal maker

446
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
But country

447
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
That's called bisque

448
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
Juno

449
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,391
Alright it's time for the last word in our debate

450
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,951
Glossary and we're going to let Donald Marron The Economist

451
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Do the honors

452
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
We asked him

453
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,791
Was there any particular

454
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Moment

455
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,583
Did stood out to you at

456
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Oh

457
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
Where is card-carrying economist

458
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,519
When mr. Trump was accusing the FED of being political

459
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
My ear zombies

460
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Picked up at that point

461
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
This is Janet Yellen of the Fed

462
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,223
The FED is doing political by keeping the interest rates at this level

463
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,551
This Janet Yellen or Citrus last in list yelling,

464
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Janet

465
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
Is the chair of the Federal Reserve

466
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
The best job is

467
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,927
Is the set interest rates

468
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,999
I Supply in Marin says Trump is leveling

469
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,327
This incredibly serious charge at yelling

470
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,607
He sang

471
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,679
Did the FED is monkeying around with interest rates

472
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
To try to sway the election

473
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,543
And that's the thing the fat is not supposed to do at all

474
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
It supposed to be in depend

475
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
To do what's best for the car

476
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,199
Ameritas that's what Janet Yellen in the Federer actually trying to do

477
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
So I don't see any evidence that the FED is acting

478
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Yeah I think there's

479
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,599
Perfectly Fair discussion to have about

480
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
Whether the FED is pursuing the right policy

481
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,487
But I don't think for a minute when should you got through Athletics

482
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,815
How to talk to a carnival

483
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
For the show I feel like

484
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
You could feel them fighting

485
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
Between the two lens

486
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,215
There's a political lens

487
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,799
What time is the economic and they were frustrated because the economic lens

488
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
Doesn't

489
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
Really make a lot of sense

490
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
What these candidates are saying

491
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,223
But you sound like you're an expert in the political

492
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Lensx

493
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,575
But that's sweet of you is it wrong to try and like tape

494
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,135
Words and in defining and say what they actually mean

495
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,951
It up so it is fine to geek out over these words

496
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
The Archers the definitions

497
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,839
But you got to understand policy does not happen without politics

498
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,935
You know so we need both working together to get anything done

499
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,471
So it's perfectly fine

500
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
To stress over these words

501
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,055
But it's also totally fine

502
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Distressed over the policy

503
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,735
6 + 2

504
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,655

Well thank you so much

536
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,487
I feel like when people say that it means that all those times I didn't say anything I was over left

537
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,327
No that's not it at all you ever looked over

538
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,887
Why you never talk about anybody else

539
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:22,655
That load
