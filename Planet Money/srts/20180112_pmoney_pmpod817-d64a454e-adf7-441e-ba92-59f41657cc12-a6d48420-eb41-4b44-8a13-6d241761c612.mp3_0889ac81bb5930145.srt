1
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,352
Getting into Cody's car there is just a

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,656
Here is just a pistol hanging out

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,240
It was just a pistol hanging out in the passenger seat so I am going to

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,288
I'm just going to be careful

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:16,896
I'm going to hang on to this thing until he gets back in the car and says that it is not loaded

6
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,944
I'm holding it away from me

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,504
The gun belongs to Cody Wilson

8
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,040
Independence vs

9
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,832
Cody is either one of the most

10
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,624
Dangerous people in the world

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,208
Or he's a twenty-nine-year-old punk pulling a prank

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,768
Or he's a hero of the First Amendment

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,608
What's what's the status of the puppy here

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,680
This gun shoots the rotors

15
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,472
Being a danger to either one of us

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,752
What is a gun

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,056
Cody is hard to pin down

18
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,616
What I do know is that he doesn't like

19
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,200
Regulations or government or the state

20
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
She does like that

21
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,528
You don't remind this is a work of art

22
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,344
I mean I saw the way you held that you held it like

23
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,160
Well I quit a measure discussed but

24
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,768
No not discuss my dad always said hold it away from you so you don't shoot your damn self

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,304
You know what they're enough

26
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,912
Cody and I are going to Best of the West which is a shooting range outside of Austin Texas

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,008
We're running late in the sun's getting lower until we pull it in a rush

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
They're going to close in like a

29
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
Going to say something

30
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,480
So he goes to check us in and he gets our tactical baby book

31
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,784
And then he gives me orange ear plugs

32
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
Kodi does not look dangerous

33
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:33,184
He has dark hair and dark eyes and little dimple in his chin Babyface

34
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
He also makes eye contact like maybe someone has spoken to him about the importance of making eye contact

35
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,960
So anyway he lays the guns out on the table and these are mostly guns that he has made

36
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,496
This is a Glock

37
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
Just as an M1911 single stack 45

38
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
This is a

39
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
Standard military configured

40
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
Colt AR-15

41
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,224
If you know guns you know the AR-15

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,832
Teen and if you don't know guns this is the one you've seen a bunch on TV

43
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:06,720
AR-15 rifles and AR style rifles were used at the movie theater shooting in Colorado

44
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,768
And the concert shooting in Las Vegas

45
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,536
And others

46
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,584
Are you going to let me shoot the AR-15 or no

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Absolutely

48
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,144
If you want to show you can shoot

49
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
I don't have any particular love for guns

50
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
As odds

51
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,128
I don't have any particular revulsion for them either unless they're used to kill or to hurt

52
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
My father owns guns

53
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
And I don't know if I want to shoot that AR

54
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,808
But at the same time I don't want Cody to think that I'm

55
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
Scared to shoot

56
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Cell

57
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,440
You're leaning back if it just kind of get that before and come forward into it a bit

58
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
Find SQL

59
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
Well

60
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,936
Yeah I like that I like that put you on fire and you want it if you want it with your own thumb you can play

61
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
Just pull it down

62
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
You can fire

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
At will

64
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Hells Bells

65
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,064
After only like three

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Three rounds with a naturally

67
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,648
Maybe I'm just one of those people

68
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
Or do you think everyone's just one

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
I have a sneaking suspicion we're all one of those p

70
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
Yeah

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Okay

72
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
Cody Wilson is a gun make

73
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,448
But he's never sold a gun and he's never killed anyone and as far as he knows

74
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
None of the countries made I've ever killed anyone so why do people think Cody Wilson is so dangerous

75
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Noel King and I'm Elizabeth collapse people think Cody Wilson

76
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
Is dangerous because he makes guns but because he's made a way for anyone to make their own

77
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
I mean that proves that he's made some start need to move from person to person in a store

78
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,448
Instead they're packed together using information that's free and easy to find on the internet

79
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,848
Guns that can go viral and potentially make gun control impossible

Noel I think we all know someone a little bit like Cody Wilson

93
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
She's the kind of person who takes a good idea

94
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Like free speech

95
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
And then he runs with it

96
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
Any runs with it so far

97
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Did it starts to make

98
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
People nervous

99
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
He really likes shocking p

100
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,439
And his main idea is

101
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Freedom

102
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,023
Every decision in Cody's life comes down to

103
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
Does this make me more free

104
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,423
He's the kind of guy who reads meechy and he talks about Anarchy

105
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
And you're thinking

106
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,519
Have you thought this through because Anarchy actually seems kind of

107
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
Terrible

108
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,359
Cody calls himself a crypto Anarchy

109
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,967
It is not clear though if this group actually wants to claim him back

110
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
There's a reason why Cody wants to align

111
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
Name self with this

112
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
They have a lot in common

113
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
Crypto anarchist

114
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
Believe that the anonymity

115
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:18,207
The internet is going to bring about

116
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
It's a world that they want to see

117
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,559
Will that they think is inevitable

118
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,655
Where to point now Whittington allows you to evade

119
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Censorship

120
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
X's and Louis

121
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
Why would anybody follow the rule

122
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,871
And you know a lot of these guys live in their heads and then they get out of

123
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,151
High school or college

124
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,967
And like they calm down you know they go off to Los

125
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,063
That is exactly what Cody Wilson did he went to law school

126
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,087
But then you realize

127
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
VA te Busco

128
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,695
I felt fully Superfluous in Moscow and I feel like a complete waste of my time

129
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
I was going to school with like Tradesmen more than

130
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
You know me choir is

131
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
Nothing Sultan of course

132
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Of course

133
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
But Cody

134
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Wanted to change the

135
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
He just have to figure out something

136
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
World-changing

137
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,895
So one dates on the phone with a college buddy thanks to spit pulled all the time about ways that they

138
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
Raise mischief

139
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
He's princess

140
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
What if we made

141
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
A gun

142
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
And it feels Cody's like

143
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,575
Well

144
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Everybody likes guns

145
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,183
It's nothing special something new to do anything there you just be coming off

146
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
Dennis Francis

147
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Listen

148
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,327
I just remember him saying what you know what about

149
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,631
3D printing a 3D printer gun

150
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,447
Wait wait hang on hang on

151
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,007
It was just like that I have no prior experience

152
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
I'm passing like maybe the other people has it

153
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
But it was that Loki hey

154
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Kodi

155
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
We could 3D print a gun

156
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,015
It was about a couple minutes into that I'm like

157
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
If that is possible

158
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
That's what I most exciting things actually

159
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
That

160
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Out of her car to me

161
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:56,511
In 2012 low cost 3D printers at taking off

162
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,863
Could you describe the 3D printer that you was going to use like an elevated hot glue gun

163
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
It takes to soften plastic and using digital blueprints if piles layer upon layer of plastic into whatever shape

164
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,847
3D printers aren't just getting cheaper they're also getting smaller

165
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
They have these ones that you can fit on your kitchen table

166
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,711
Two people are using them at home

167
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,527
And they're making simple solid objects

168
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
Play toys and figurines

169
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,671
But as far as Cody can tell no one's ever used a 3-D printer to make a gun

170
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
And then made the blueprints public

171
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,839
Going to a gun store and scanned it account at to buy a gun

172
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,655
Jupiter digital blueprint online for free

173
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,215
And then anyone can take it and improve on it

174
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,007
3D print their own gun

175
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
He does a little bit of research

176
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
Any figures that to lease a high grade 3D printer and to hire an engineer he needs about 20,000

177
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
$1

178
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,527
Restart the campaign on a crowdfunding site

179
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:55,647
He makes a video when he's sitting there in like a peach colored Church shirt look about 14 years old

180
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,695
And talking about his idea

181
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
For a Wiki weapon

182
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,815
The product is in the right position what we're interested in producing is

183
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
A digital file

184
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
The file itself

185
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
VShare

186
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,239
Let me explain saying here is

187
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
I'm not interested in making and selling

188
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Actual

189
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,079
Physical

190
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,407
I'm interested in the free exchange of ideas

191
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,503
A lot of people watch the video but no one is really giving him any money

192
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,295
He gets a handful of calls

193
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,391
Is one dude from West Texas who gets in touch and says hey this is a great project I'd like to

194
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,791
Help me with a multi-millionaire in West Texas and he had a big oil company I checked out and checked it out and checked out General company

195
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
The guy that helped finance

196
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
Scientific stopping at all checked out I was at when I was rich

197
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Curious

198
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Anime

199
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
I'm a chat you know ice

200
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
Zwilling give a kid a chance to

201
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,359
Oh and he got me he was he was the first guy to get me I had never been

202
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,407
Catfish by the insane

203
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,223
This gentleman apparently really just wanted to talk

204
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
On the phone

205
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,367
Seven three weeks Cody had only raised a couple thousand dollars and the needle was stuck

206
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,415
And then the crowdfunding sites

207
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
They like

208
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Hey

209
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
With a pipe bomb will you come to fundraise

210
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Feel like

211
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
Smart tooth

212
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
Not a god

213
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,167
At the same time Cody gets a break

214
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,751
A reporter from fold magazine he's about what he's planning

215
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Holding up

216
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
You for real

217
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,591
Call you like

218
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
I sure am

219
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
So you got the profile info

220
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
First line of the article

221
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
Cody Wilson

222
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,783
Has a simple

223
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,879
Cody Wilson has a simple dream and after that the money comes

224
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,487
It's pouring and it's just a handful of people but they are people who are really behind

225
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,839
Erase is almost $20,000 and he can finally lease

226
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
A 3D

227
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
A beautiful 3D

228
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
Print out by the way the delivery truck rolls up

229
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
I'm in the back door open

230
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,847
They listed it down on a pallet and I tore down off a pallet of beside my apartment complex so I can

231
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,663
West Campus

232
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,527
But then a couple days later he gets an email from the printer companies lawyer

233
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,111
An email says basically at Hey kid

234
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
We heard about you

235
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
You're trying to use our printer to make a gun

236
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
We will be picking it up from your apartment

237
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
Tomorrow

238
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,095
Well I had made a lot of progress I hadn't unboxed

239
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
Most of it in fact

240
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,471
I don't have it for a few days a couple days top Center

241
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
They came to my house they took the boxes out

242
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,823
They put them on the truck on a lift gate and

243
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
IWatch Tikka

244
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,407
So his printer is now gone

245
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
But rather than back down he gets

246
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
Defiant

247
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,039
Now he needs to do this

248
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,599
Because not doing it would be loose

249
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
He figures by now no one else is going to sell him only

250
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,047
But he has a back-up plan he knows a small 3D printing shop in Austin and Leona's

251
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:47,423
A game a couple of dudes in a machine shop in on st. Elmo in Austin Texas they want to have some fun

252
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,983
Cody just go back his Ambitions a little bit

253
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,079
He decides he doesn't need these guys to 3D printing and entire gun

254
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
The engineering part of this is actually really difficult

255
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
So he's just going to have them print

256
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
Single gun

257
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Part

258
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,551
Because there was a gun parts as a single guy

259
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,343
Pot that had already been

260
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Printed with

261
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,207
Another gunsmith at donut he put his blueprints online

262
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,535
It was a lower receiver of an AR-15 rifle

263
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,607
The lower receiver is the part that makes

264
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
The gun A gun

265
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
It's the foundation

266
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
It houses the magazine with the rounds

267
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
Firing mechanism

268
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
The receiver is also the part of the gun where you have the

269
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
Serial number

270
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,663
It's a part of the gun that you need a background check to buy

271
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:34,015
So if you can 3D print one of these things you're making a gun part

272
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Without needing a background check

273
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
That has no serial number

274
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,671
And that can be turned into an untraceable gun

275
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
So Cody hands over the digital

276
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Prince to the

277
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
Company and they call him the next one

278
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,607
Ushered me into the back room and said look it's ready it was finished for you

279
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Hey listen

280
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
The printer had a Bay open

281
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
We took it out

282
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
Separated from the

283
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
From the plate and

284
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
It's beautiful I never see this

285
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,847
Is she not at this kind of

286
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,151
Material that needs to be removed from it

287
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
It's kind of like a

288
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,527
Call like the afterbirth items are just beautiful stuff that needs to be removed they cleaned it up for me

289
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Literally like I have been born in

290
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
And they

291
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
I put in my gun case and we just had my heart

292
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
Shuffle purpose FL

293
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
So powerfully

294
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Parts of my car and you after that

295
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,935
Put in the passenger seat of my car and he drove straight to the house of a machinist Inu outside of Oz

296
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
And when he got there the sun was setting

297
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,311
And they were all of these people all of these gun enthusiast

298
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
Good heard about what this kid was

299
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Trying to pull off

300
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,199
Who takes the receiver out of the case and he passes it around

301
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
I was green it was fleshy with strange

302
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,807
You know the season guys for like without you knowing

303
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
Not comfortable too much

304
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,135
Benedict potluck dinner to celebrate

305
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Curry slept on the floor that night

306
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
Next morning he The Machinist

307
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,511
Machinist shop

308
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
Fishing is together 3D printed lower receiver

309
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
At the other pods

310
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:52,863
End

311
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,143
Fate had today off

312
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
15

313
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,191
The question now was a

314
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,471
Do they have a working

315
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
So they drive out to the Hill Country

316
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,383
To find out and of course Cody takes a video of all this and puts it up online

317
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,943
I posted up on a steel Target

318
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
I have my glasses on

319
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Anna

320
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:17,183
I squeezed a shot and I heard it hit I felt the gun kind of pulse

321
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
My shoulders when I look down

322
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
I need to survive

323
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
I don't know it was probably greatest day of my life

324
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
He done it

325
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
It worked

326
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:28,447
He had printed a gun pot a crucial gun pod

327
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
From blueprints that he could now

328
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Share with anyone

329
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Online

330
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
It wasn't Hogan

331
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
Which is what he wanted

332
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,151
But this was a big step forward

333
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
Remember Cody was

334
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Still a lost

335
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
In about a month after he shot that video he was in a big lecture hall about to sit an exam and he's taking his stuff out of his bag and it's

336
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,647
Phone pings

337
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,743
And there is a text from Andy the reporter who profiled him in Forbes

338
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,279
Emma text says

339
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,095
Does this change your project does this change what you're going to do

340
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
I don't know what you mean

341
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
So it puts it out of his mind

342
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
Until the exam is over

343
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,031
And a couple hours later he gets out into the hallway

344
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,591
And he's making his way down a hill to his car

345
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,663
Randy sent me another text message Sammy said it just said Newtown Connecticut

346
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,015
So I Googled Newtown Connecticut and I found

347
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
I found exactly what it happen

348
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
And

349
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
I won't lie to you

350
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
I I thought

351
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,951
Okay

352
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
I'm ahead of us

353
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
That's what I thought

354
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
What do you mean I'm ahead of this

355
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
I knew immediately this was going to be

356
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
A big one

357
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
This was going to be the next

358
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
For five months are going to be about American gun control

359
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
And

360
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:46,527
The attempted bills bills in the house bills in the Senate the president's efforts you know we were going to start selling and campaigning on guitar just knew that

361
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
That engine was starting up

362
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,111
I knew it there are people who are going

363
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,415
Want to know why your first thought wasn't

364
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
A bunch of

365
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
Small children

366
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,303
I have been shot and killed in a school

367
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
I am trying to understand

368
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
A thought process

369
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,959
That goes directly to

370
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
I'm out in front of this instead of

371
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Oh my God

372
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,615
The thing I like the thing that I cared about

373
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
Was that I had a project I had to do to Fidelity

374
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Tell the truth

375
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
Love that product like I was going to make it happen

376
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
And

377
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
This in my my update

378
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:28,767
Up the ante but as well at VNC in the next in the next few days and weeks I began to see that people began to take a passionate

379
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,535
My project

380
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Not

381
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,679
The school is a curious what a cool new tech idea people began to think

382
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
Intend to say

383
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
You must when you must do it they're going to take

384
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,591
The stuff away from us so we went from being kind of curiosity on the internet

385
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
The people

386
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
People needing us

387
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Saying that they needed us

388
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
To win

389
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Dance to this

390
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
It's about the pasta

391
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
First for me

392
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
I need to just

393
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Jump it

394
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
NF

395
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,487
Do you have an emotional human response

396
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,535
To the death of children

397
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
Small children in a classroom

398
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
With a gun

399
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,679
I'm trying to understand

400
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,495
If you are feeling anything about that

401
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
I know this matter

402
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,383
Innocent, casual social casualty of of a climate of

403
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Persistent

404
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,711
Yeah I like mass shootings and stuff I mean it's not

405
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
The first

406
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
Thought you have sadly

407
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,087
Is that okay yeah there's another shooting

408
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,879
Babies babies mark

409
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
I get that

410
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
Okay what do you feel it

411
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,023
I did it and feel it I understand that that

412
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
It is bad

413
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
But I'm already in a

414
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
In a place

415
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,399
An activist mentality

416
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,447
What is going to be done with

417
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
How is it going to be used

418
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
How's it going to be used against me

419
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Look I mean that's

420
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
That's where I am

421
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,479
Okay I'll be asleep Cody and I were not going to see this the same way

422
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,551
But Elizabeth you heard what he was saying there he was saying

423
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,135
We were afraid that the government was going to come and take our guns away

424
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,695
He was not the only person thinking that

425
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
The truth is

426
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,071
We know that after mass shootings gun sales 10 to go up

427
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,911
But after Newtown their fears didn't really come true

428
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:16,031
This country didn't pass any really significant National gun control laws

429
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
But something else did happen here

430
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
Cimino's begin Cody's

431
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:26,271
The community that he'd belong to those make is the people playing around with 3D printed online

432
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,551
They turned on him

433
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
And people like

434
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
They started pulling off their websites

435
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,463
Anything that has to do with 3D printing weapons and guns

436
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
This infuriated

437
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Kodi

438
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
He was like

439
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,863
DoubleDown make his own webs

440
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,447
He takes his Blueprints and digital files that are being dumped

441
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
I put them back online

442
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
Trees raising the stakes year

443
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,335
And then he raises them to a point where they

444
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Can't get

445
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
Much higher

446
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:56,991
Remember she was still determined to 3D print an entire working gun

447
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
And after a couple months

448
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
He did it

449
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,855
This little pistol called The Liberator

450
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
It work

451
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,671
It was a real working 3D print

452
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Gun

453
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,767
It takes a liberator Blueprints and puts them on his website

454
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
And in the next 2 days

455
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,887
100000 people from all over the world

456
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Download them

457
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,703
24 hours after that

458
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,007
Cody gets a letter from the US state

459
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:24,127
And for something written in legalese it is very clear that he is an enormous.

460
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,943
The latest said Cody may be in violation of some

461
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
The international traffic

462
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
In regulation

463
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
Itar is a set of regulations that controls the export of Munitions weapons from the u.s. to any other

464
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,511
And there are lots of rules about which weapons

465
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
Can be sent outside

466
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
And and where they can

467
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
And the state department letter to Cody says

468
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,447
Look when you uploaded those blueprints to the internet

469
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,007
You exported weapons overseas

470
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
Each download

471
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
To form person was this was a violation

472
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
We're talking about a hundred thousand

473
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
A violation

474
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,223
Hundreds of thousands of violations

475
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
You personally responsible for it

476
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,343
It's basically like being a being a Gunrunner on the Internet or some

477
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,951
I mean his website didn't just have the blueprints for his 3D printed pistol

478
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,559
They were blueprints for other guns there were blueprints for an anti-aircraft Warhead

479
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,887
But he's letting sporting actual guns a weapon

480
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
Bryce this is where it gets complicated

481
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,007
Itar controls distribution of

482
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,079
Hardware software and Technical data

483
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,687
The state department is saying these digital blueprints count as technical data

484
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
I guess what he's doing really he's against us

485
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,295
I mean it really depends

486
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,391
The state department says look you didn't get a license to upload this

487
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,183
And that is the rule with x

488
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,487
Do you want to export something you need to prove

489
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,815
What he didn't ask for approval so okay

490
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,167
But if you follow the state Department's rules to the letter you can see that the

491
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Very

492
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
Is Harry respect

493
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,799
I'm thinking basically classify anything they want as

494
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
Technical data

495
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,359
And yet at the same time

496
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,175
Legally I cannot be used to restrict free speech

497
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
Is legal precedent

498
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,551
And we have an example of just how tricky this can get

499
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,951
Elizabeth you are an Australian citizen you are okay and so let's say right here in studio I'm going to tell you how

500
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,999
How to make a very simple

501
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,071
Step 1 Step 2 Step 3

502
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:19,839
Bang

503
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,607
Pictures how you doing

504
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,679
Cooties lawyer who of course is on Cody side

505
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
He says if you interpret itarsi

506
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,055
Strictly I just exported a gun to Australia

507
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Illegally

508
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,591
Missy League

509
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
Illegally I could get in trouble

510
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,175
And this is what Cody was

511
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
He could be in trouble

512
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
The thing is whether you like Cody or not you have to imagine a world where the government gets to decide that I can't tell you

513
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
What was it that certain things

514
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
Because that is technically exporting munition

515
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,279
I'm not feels a whole lot like restrict

516
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,839
Yes and it did to Cody to

517
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,887
She did take his website down

518
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,727
He was facing 20 years in prison and $1000000 fine for each

519
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,751
Foreign download

520
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,799
But the word got out

521
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,615
And there are a lot of lawyers out there who are really into

522
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,431
Interested in not restricting the First Amendment

523
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,759
And also a lot of lawyers who are interested in the complexities of it

524
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,599
Security hire some of them and he sues the state department

525
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,391
And his legal strategy is this

526
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
The stuff you put online the digital blueprint

527
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,000
That's not technical data

528
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
That is speech

529
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,632
Some of the top lawyers in the country are now working for Kodi

530
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Escapism

531
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,448
Kicked around the lower courts in Texas

532
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,080
Dinosaurs actually tried to get the Supreme Court to hear it and recently found out that the Supreme Court will not

533
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
So it's going back to a lower court in

534
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
Peter Cody points out

535
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
Virginia is already out of this photo

536
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,552
350 guns Realty happening now and

537
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,624
In many ways it doesn't really matter what the governor

538
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,208
The whole conversation had been fixed since the late eighties

539
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,024
That one American gun control is always going to look like

540
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,584
How we were going to do gradualism kind of get to

541
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Why don't some consensus place

542
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,936
An innocence that arguments or repeated everyday winner

543
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,008
How can this balance between what we got to control things and

544
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
You know this kind of person can buy guns

545
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,360
A person can't of course that's all exploded

546
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
In a world where you can just download whatever kind you want

547
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,992
At which is the world's you want

548
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
Fossil wallet made

549
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,112
After the break

550
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,416
How you take a dangerous idea

551
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
And make it even more Danger

552
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,304
This message comes from NPR sponsor Capital One

553
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,352
Capital One is reimagining banking

554
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,912
I offering accounts with no fees or minimum

555
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,728
That can be open from anywhere in 5 minutes

556
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Capital One

557
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,776
What's in your wallet

558
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,312
Capital One na

559
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,896
I've been talking to Cody for a few weeks about what he's doing now

560
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:46,016
He is still taking good ideas like free speech and then taking them

561
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
Very very far

562
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,112
His latest project is a crowdfunding platform called

563
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
Heatran

564
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,720
It lets people donate money to personalities including whites

565
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,048
Supremacist like Andrew Anglin and Richard Spencer who have been

566
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Kicked off other

567
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
He's giving them a home

568
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,192
And he is also in manufacturing now

569
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
So here's what he's doing

570
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,032
The government pulled them offline yes

571
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
So he started Manufacturing

572
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Gun Mills

573
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,408
This is hardware computer-controlled Mill

574
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,200
Amil is a black

575
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
Steel box

576
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:21,600
She's very heavy it's about a foot by a foot inside of it is a drill a cutter that can move in three dimensions

577
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,696
It can make a AR-15 lower receivers with no serial number

578
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
Gun control Advocates call these ghost guns

579
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,840
So Cody is kind of a middle finger calls his male the ghost Gunner

580
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,144
It can also take a metal frame

581
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,240
What pistol frame and make it into a weapon with Cody actually showed me

582
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
It comes in a pistol frame and comes out

583
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Illegal

584
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Firearm

585
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:46,176
Cody's company has sold about 4500 of these

586
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,248
They go for around $1,700

587
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
And I think it's tempting to look at them and saying

588
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,648
Well that's not as big a deal is 3D printing right it's just a mill

589
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,952
But you never reported that Cody was talking about

590
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,792
Andy his name is Andy Greenberg and he's a writer for Wired mag

591
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,352
Now we called him up and he said

592
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,120
Don't be mistaken

593
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,912
These nails are really

594
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,680
Significant

595
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
They make it easy to make untraceable

596
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
Those pots are made of metal

597
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
And as an experiment and even tried to

598
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
To do this himself

599
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Inside the sound

600
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,736
Like almost like an infomercial this is actually

601
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,016
Results of the experiment

602
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,344
Is it is works great usually it was

603
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
It was a piece of cake

604
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,440
Did greatest durable metal

605
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
Lower receiver for a semi-automatic rifle

606
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,536
I just remember that

607
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
Nobody

608
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
Except me

609
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,632
And I didn't wake up. Co

610
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
Sacrum of wired

611
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
Office in San Francisco

612
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
And he started writing about Cody

613
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,544
Assuming that lawmakers would

614
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Freak out

615
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,592
When they heard about this guy

616
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,944
Legislation would be passed to ban ghost guns really believe that was good

617
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,784
California does have a bad in the books that will take effect later

618
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Is he us

619
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,368
Korea got me attention of a handful of other lawmakers

620
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,928
But aside from that largely not

621
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
Has changed

622
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
Anyway

623
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:07,840
Cody and I stayed at the shooting range until just about Sunset and then this guy rolled up in a golf cart

624
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,632
I'm holding a weapon

625
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
I got two minutes left

626
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,192
2 minutes left

627
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
1935

628
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,288
1735 Northeast fire thank you sir

629
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,872
So I asked her hey can I take your picture and he says he of course any

630
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,688
He picks up one of the rifles and I put my camera phone at him

631
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,504
And he like deliberately makes this

632
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,552
Really mean angry

633
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,904
You don't even look like Cody that I've come to know today you look like a gunman

634
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,208
You look like a gun when you look like an actual gunman

635
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,512
Yeah I'm the guy that helps you make the guns on the gun now

636
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Elizabeth he was

637
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
Totally performing

638
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,632
And I wanted to say that I wanted to say you are

639
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
Performing

640
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:49,056
But I knew that he turning on me and he'd say will you know what your performing to and then you Cody being Cody would turn into this hole

641
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
Philosophical fight

642
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
And to be honest

643
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
The place was closing and I was tired

644
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
So I let it go

645
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,248
I helped him put the guns back in the car

646
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
And we left

647
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:05,440
