Because I like

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
The first one so I had to

15
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,280
To finish all of them

16
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,560

And short stories

20
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
And just last week

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,776
I feel completed something that to me sounds

22
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,824
A little alarming

23
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,872
She decided to listen to

24
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152

25
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,456
Single episode of Planet Money

26
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
Ever made

27
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,064
We occasionally hear from other people who have done this

28
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
For the record

29
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,648
No one on our team has

30
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,976
I guess my first question that I have to ask is like

31
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,024
Are you okay that's

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,072
So much Planet Money to listen to

33
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,656
You know six months ago I give up

34
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,240
And after doing that I so how many do I have left

35
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,008
Was

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
300

37
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,592
And I said to myself

38
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,384
I can do it and I will do it

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,736
Just about 900 episodes here at Planet Money and

40
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
Honestly

41
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,344
Sometimes it feels like there is nothing

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Left

43
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
To make a show about

44
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
So I want to ask Asia

45
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,744
In all of that time

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,536
All of those episodes

47
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,120
What are some things that we have never talked about

48
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,216
I don't know I don't think it was in any episode about theme park

49
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Theme park

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
Next we missed theme park

51
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,824
What about the cost of

52
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Moving

53
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Goodwin

54
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:58,272
Submarines and Marines so I guess there are still a few things left

55
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
Cover over something to cover Asia is right there is

56
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:11,072
Something left a cupboard and sometimes we ask you the listeners to help us find it

57

People often think annuities are too conservative

70
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,120
Too complex or only for retirees

71
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,424

All right Sarah Gonzalez

89
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,816
I had to bring you into the studio to imagine a world

90
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,584
That is

91
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,400
Kind of unimaginable

92
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,728
A world where everyone who wants a job

93
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,008
Has a job

94
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
Yes

95
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,568
We got a question about this from

96
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,384
Chris Jeffries on Twitter and he said hey

97
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
What would it be like

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
If we had

99
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
0%

100
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
Unemployment in the US for a few years

101
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
Sounds like a great world

102
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
It sounds good

103
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
Just know it's know there's

104
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
This

105
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
It's

106
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
It's not

107
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
I just can't even wrap my head around it

108
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:52,704
This is Heidi Schierholtz she's a labor Economist at the economic policy Institute in DC

109
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,288
And she used to be the chief Economist at the Department of Labor under

110
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
President Obama

111
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,872
So let's say hypothetically like hypothetically

112
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,968
If the United States did have 0% unemployment what

113
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
What will happen

114
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
The economy

115
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:11,392
That's hard to imagine that I can't can we do it more like if it went very low

116
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
I can't I can't even wrap my brain around

117
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
Cruzeiro

118
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Impossible to even pay

119
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
If you got an unemployment rate

120
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,167
Anywhere near

121
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:23,935
0 /

122
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Science

123
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
You're going to

124
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Etsy

125
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,823
Dangerous effects of adjusted

126
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
An overheated economy

127
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,943
So right now the unemployment rate is 3.9%

128
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,247
If we got close to 0%

129
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
Here's what that would

130
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
The minute you wanted a job

131
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
You just had

132
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,927
No one would be unemployed that even for a little while

133
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,999
And if you're an employer and you need

134
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
To hire someone for a job opening that would make things

135
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,839
Complicated because

136
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,399
You have to lure away someone else is in

137
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
Employee

138
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
And in order to

139
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:59,263
Keep your own workers and lure someone else's

140
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
You'd have to increase

141
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
Priest wages

142
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
Which would be a good thing more money

143
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
But

144
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
If employers are

145
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,759
Constantly giving everyone in the country pay raises

146
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
That employer

147
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
They have to start increasing price

148
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
Cover the cost of those increase

149
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Beijing wages

150
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,207
And those increases

151
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Prices

152
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
If it happens on math

153
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Can lead to

154
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,351
Accelerating inflation

155
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
Inflation Rising prices across the

156
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,727
And a little bit of inflation is okay

157
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,823
But in this world that were talking about it could be out of control

158
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
Right

159
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:38,943
Economist say we have to balance employment

160
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
And inflation

161
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,551
And the perfect Ideal Balance is called

162
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,087
Full employment

163
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,391
No one actually knows what the

164
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
The unemployment rate would be in that scenario

165
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,023
But Heidi says that full employment is when

166
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
Everyone who wants a job

167
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,607
Can find a job

168
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
But

169
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,191
You may be unemployed for a little bit of time

170
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,495
So there is some unemployment

171
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
But

172
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
The kind were okay with

173
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
So

174
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
Maybe we can talk Chris

175
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
But full employment is kind of like

176
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
Economist zero unemployment

177
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
And also that

178
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
Chris you should not want

179
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
The United States

180
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
To achieve

181
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,415
True 0% unemployment that would not be a good thing

182
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
For any of us

183
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
Don't do it Chris

184
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375

00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:33,983

I'm a little sick I'm so sorry for anyone

188
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,455
Listen to this but I think it will be worth your time

189
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,735
What do you have for

190
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,319
In the United States Ally you are aware

191
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Two ways

192
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,671
Of getting housing you buy property

193
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
Or you rent it

194
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,463
Yelp

195
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,535
Better listener Richard Lee in ours was in South Korea recent

196
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,351
And was interested in a potential third up

197
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
A system known

198
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
As Chauncey

199
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Shenzhen

200
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
That's right

201
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,287
So I can say can be translated as

202
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Key money deposit

203
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
Key money deposit

204
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
Yes he money deposit

205
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:18,783
This is Professor Jung Seung Kim was born in South Korea and is now an economics professor at Bryant University

206
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
In Rhode Island

207
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
He told me translate is

208
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
It's kind of like a giant

209
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,391
Security deposit

210
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,695
If I want to live in your house

211
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,255
I hand over some lumps out of money

212
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,535
I move in

213
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
Usually for 2 years

214
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,655
I don't pay you any monthly payments nothing

215
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
It's just that love Simon

216
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Beginning

217
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
And then at the end of the two years

218
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
I'm about

219
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
And you give me my money back

220
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,103
Okay but what if I like

221
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,919
Lost your money well luckily I am

222
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943
Living in

223
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,247
Collateral like I'm living in your house

224
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,623
Are there protections maybe there's insurance or a lien or worst case scenario maybe I get a cut

225
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,439
Of the sale of your house but hopefully you will not lose

226
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
Mighty money deposit

227
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,255
What ends up being like

228
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,863
An interest-free loan from you the renter to me the homeowner

229
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,143
With the house as the collateral

230
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:06,911
Exactly

231
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
And can be a lot

232
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Money up front

233
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,591
Anywhere from 50% to 80% of the market value of the real estate

234
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Almost

235
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Buying

236
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
The apartment

237
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:22,527
Right but without buying the apartment she sounds a little ridiculous

238
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
Johnson says this system made a lot more sense in the

239
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,951
When home prices in South Korea with skyrocketing

240
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,255
And thanks we're really giving out mortgages

241
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
Translate development Middle Ground

242
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
Who couldn't afford to buy

243
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
But didn't want to throw their money away

244
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Rent

245
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
And landlords Luvdisc

246
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,007
Because they could take this key money deposit

247
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,287
And then invested

248
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,335
There were these insanely High interest rate

249
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
25 to 30%

250
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
It's the perfect match between

251
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,247
The homeowners in the East End of the renters needs

252
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
One of the questions are listener had

253
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,671
Is whether or not this kind of a system would translate well into the United

254
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
I am a little sceptic

255
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
Because he says

256
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,559
For starters Americans just aren't familiar with

257
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Probably be

258
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
Weird but if we could get over that

259
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,447
There's like where you going to put the money

260
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
If your a landlord where you going to get a

261
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,591
A good investment you can't go get those 25% interest rates

262
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Anywhere

263
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
So

264
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
It's just too risky

265
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,967
Like it's better just to get the Sure Fire Red

266
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
And by the way this is

267
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
True in South Korea is

268
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,391
As well the chance a does not make nearly as much sense as it did in the

269
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
Sixties and Johnson suspect

270
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
That it is probably on its way out

271
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
Don't get to know about

272
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,559
Kenny Malone thank you you're welcome

273
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,887
Okay but

274
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,191
I actually need you to stay here in the studio

275
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,263
But I'm I know you but I need you because

276
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
We're going to do a lot of math

277
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,079
I know you were a math major

278
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,407
It's going to be good okay

279
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,479
We got a two-part question from Allison and Brian heitner

280
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,527
Have Airline life vest

281
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Ever saved

282
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,855
Single life in the history of Aviation

283
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
And how much do they cost

284
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
OIC he's

285
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,023
Wants to know is it like worth it to be paying for these vests and then

286
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Flying tomorrow

287
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,375
Oh yeah he told me that he thinks it's not worth it that's it

288
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
Listen to this for him

289
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,495
And I talked to this guy named Harrow renter

290
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,799
He runs a state database of plane crashes

291
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
And he sent me a list

292
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Of

293
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
Times when passenger planes

294
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,967
Have had to land on water instead of can

295
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Controlled way

296
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
Cold itching

297
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
And theoretically

298
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,879
That's when you left us could come in handy right because you might have some time

299
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
To grab it

300
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,719
So on this list there are 43 cases of this

301
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,815
In the last 50 years all kinds of plants like small ones only if

302
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
A few big commercial Jets

303
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,655
But Harrison life vests have almost

304
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
Certainly saved lives in at least

305
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Some of these

306
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
If you're just talking about big commercial planes

307
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,591
More complicated but history of Aviation

308
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
Definitely yes

309
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
Okay okay

310
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Now cost

311
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
This isn't this turned out to be very calm

312
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,903
Okay babe. I talked to one major airline who told me that they get their life vests

313
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,463
440 bucks a pop and they last for 10 years

314
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:14,559
Send it like a penny is a that's 100% worth it

315
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
There's some food lot more together

316
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,655
So I got in touch with

317
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,239
Robin riddle who's a partner McKinsey who is an airline expert

318
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
He was like you got to think about the

319
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Fuel cost

320
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,639
Write the fuel cost because the more

321
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
Martial art uses

322
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
How much does a life vest

323
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,855
Point eight pounds roughly according to Robin

324
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,183
Including the density of jet fuel

325
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,511
And it comes out to about $0.04

326
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,535
Purvis

327
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
Per hour of flight

328
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Okay

329
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:53,471
So then you multiply that by the average number of hours that a plane in the air per day which I got from it

330
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
And then you do that over 10 years

331
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
And you get

332
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
About

333
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,175
$133.59

334
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,223
$133

335
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
And $0.59

336
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Is

337
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
The amount spent on

338
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Fuel

339
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
Flying one pets around the world

340
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
Relic typically on average

341
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:19,583
Track my flight

342
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
Do some division

343
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,655
It comes out to about

344
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
$0.05

345
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
Purvis

346
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Per day

347
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
$0.05

348
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
Five cents to have a

349
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,943
The vest on my flight there is like some labor costs associated with at 2 because flight attendants have a check then

350
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
Because apparently sometimes people steal them

351
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
That's preposterous I know

352
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
I'm so happy to be subsidizing

353
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
Even saving one life

354
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
In history and even if it were zero

355
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,743
I'm pretty happy to pay a nickel just to have the

356
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
Theoretical life-saving device

357
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,863
Listen to Ryan

358
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
During cost benefit analysis based on that but

359
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
This is no brainer for me

360
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
Yeah I guess

361
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
I don't know

362
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,079
It's pretty unlikely you're going to use it on a normal flight

363
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
There's a lot of planes out there

364
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,967
But I guess Sally five-set says it's comforting to have a life vest for $0.05

365
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,735
I think I think

366
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:15,135
That's probably right this is madness

367
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:21,279
Okay that was a lot of numbers

368
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,303
We need a break

369
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,399
Existential where

370
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,679
Is

371
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
The terror

372
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Support for this party

373
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
And the following message

374
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Come from State

375
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
Who's agent snow

376
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
That your car and home

377
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Are more than just

378
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Big purchases

379
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
They're a big part

380
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Of your life

381
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
You put the time

382
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783

383
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575

386

387
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Play do they truly get you

388
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
But they'll be there for

389
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
For you when you need

And with over 19000

391

Neighborhoods across the US

392
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
There could be

393
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Just around

394
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Moritz statefarm.com

395
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
1 800 state

396
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
State Farm

397
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Here to help life

398
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Go right

399
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
Tariffs are something that we

400
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,175
Hikari on planet many many many times

401
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
But we have never

402
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,991
To my knowledge

403
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Atera

404
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,903
And we got a question from listener Steve Whitworth the Bisley SS

405
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
When someone pays a tariff

406
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
Where does the money go

407
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
And that kind of thinking just like

408
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Where

409
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Is

410
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
The Terrace

411
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,423
In the most concrete possible way

412
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
And Stacey Vanek Smith

413
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,079
Is here with us by Sally whole host of the indicator Planet Money daily economic

414
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
What's podcast

415
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
I hear that you

416
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
Found the Terrace you touch them

417
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
This is true

418
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,759
I found them and I touch them

419
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
If you want to do this you go to Newark

420
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
New Jersey

421
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
To the US Customs and Border Protection

422
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Protection building in Newark

423
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
And there

424
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,231
In this building

425
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
You will find

426
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
A massive

427
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
It is the harmonized

428
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
Tariff schedule of the United states

429
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:08,799
Wheel of the harmonized Tariff schedule it was all the terrorists with more than 3,000 pages

430
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
It has everything you could import

431
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Yak United States

432
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,967
The woman who showed us all this information by the way was a woman named Linda Burke

433
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,319
And she took us through the Tariff book from moon rocks to purses to shoes

434
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
The works

435
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
Okay so you saw the Terrace

436
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
On paper

437
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
But

438
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
We wanted more than just

439
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,279
Paper we wanted to get closer

440
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,559
To the money

441
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
Where does the

442
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
Tariff happen

443
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
Like let's say there's like a 20% tariff on

444
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
Sandals from China

445
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,311
Who pays that when do they pay it like how does that even happen

446
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,895
After the merchandise is accepted into our Commerce

447
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
The

448
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,271
Broker has 10 days actually happened

449
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Once items

450
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Already arrived in the United

451
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,391
The people on the hook for tariffs

452
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
State government

453
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Are American imp

454
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Who often pay through it

455
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
A broker

456
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
And they get something that is

457
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Kind of like

458
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
A credit card bill

459
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,655
Sofas like sandals Inc based in Tacoma

460
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
Send sandals ankle pays the import fee

461
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Pratt

462
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
And then how do they

463
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Who do they pay

464
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
They pay

465
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
National Finance Center CBP

466
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,967
Typically start electronically very

467
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,759
We see less and less checks

468
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Every year

469
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,599
Cash is almost unheard of nowadays

470
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
But it still happen

471
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,231
Rarely if I would be surprised once or twice a year

472
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:36,095
Tariffs and cash man but it sounds like we didn't get to touch bags of cash

473
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
I costumes

474
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
There was no bags of cash that they let us see

475
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:44,031
But they did say that they are electronically bringing in a ton of money

476
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
After the IRS

477
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
Eccpp that

478
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,711
Customs and Border Protection is the country's biggest revenue-generating agent

479
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,783
It collected more than 40 billion dollars worth of Paris

480
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
That is a lot

481
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,183
To be fair at the IRS did bring in more than 3 trillion dollars but still a lot

482
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,999
And for the last part of Steve's quest

483
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,071
Where does the tariff money go

484
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,863
That is an excellent question

485
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,911
It could basically go anywhere

486
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,215
It just gets put into the US Treasury and because

487
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
Part of the money that the government uses to

488
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
To pay its bills

489
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
So anyway it's all around us

490
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
In a way

491
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
It's everywhere

492
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
Thank you Stacey

493
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
You're so welcome

494
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711

495
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:28,063

00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,367
Daisy hosted with Cardiff Garcia it is

497
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,975
Excellent excellent excellent go check app

498
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:45,983
Now here with our last topic for the day we have Bryant or Stat our editor Bryant

499
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Hello

500
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
So shoot what are you got on your mind

501
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
Meg Larson said it's an email about a drive sheet

502
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Took through Minnesota

503
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
And on the way

504
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,967
She notices something there all these huge

505
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Huge huge

506
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,039
RV recreational

507
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Vehicle

508
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Dealership

509
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
And she wants to know

510
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,463
Can there possibly be this many people buying RVs why are they so big

511
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:12,607
And it was something I've been wanting about to I have been driving by the same dealer in Massachusetts for literally decades

512
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:17,471
I've always been amazed at how enormous at Seaview Drive 4 miles is nothing and then there's just a

513
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Filled filled with RV

514
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,335
Okay so massive RV dealerships

515
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,615
Across the country

516
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
What did you find out

517
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:31,039
Well it was pretty easy to find a person who knew the answer room I'm the director of media relations for the RV

518
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
Industry Association

519
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,135
There's always an association when you need one

520
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
And he said something that surprised

521
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,999
He said RV dealers really aren't that big

522
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
It says what Meg

523
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
Is experiencing

524
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,071
Is actually

525
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,119
Magic there's a little bit of a knob

526
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,143
Pollution effects

527
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
And the dealers

528
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
They're kind of David copperfield's

529
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
David Copperfield

530
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Magician

531
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
David Copperfield was like a Dickens care

532
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,479
Calculator became a magician and had a huge television show in the 80s

533
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:07,647
Can the generations never talk to one another if we're talking now we're just not understanding each other

534
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
Anyway the Steelers there a bunch of David Copper

535
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,255
They put their biggest

536
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
Highest end

537
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
RVs

538
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
For the front of the lot

539
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,655
And so as your driving by it looks like there are a lot of fun

540
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
But there aren't Nessa

541
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Sara Lee

542
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,727
As many as you think

543
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,775
So this is like the fake western town

544
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,871
And I'm in Hollywood a little bit and I Google that place in

545
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,199
It's ensure enough right there on satellite view on maps I could see it

546
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,527
There were not hundreds and hundreds of RVs as I thought but

547
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
Just like

548
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Dozens

549
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:41,439
Strategically positioned so that from the road look like an endless field it's all a lie

550
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
It's mostly a lie

551
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
