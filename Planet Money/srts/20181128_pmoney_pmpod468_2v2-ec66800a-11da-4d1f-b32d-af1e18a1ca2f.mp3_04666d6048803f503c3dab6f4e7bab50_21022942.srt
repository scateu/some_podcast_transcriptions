1
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:08,448
Hey it's Noel King here and I'm going to talk about planet money for just a really quick second there about 10 of us on

2
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,216
The team here

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:15,616
We put out about a hundred episodes every year and any even one of those episodes can take a reporter week

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,408
Or even months to finish

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:23,808
We do a ton of research we travel all over the world and then there's a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff like figuring

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:29,952
Hangout how to buy 100 barrels of crude oil or when is the best time of year to launch a satellite

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,352
And the thing I think that probably takes the most time believe it or not is fact-checking we do so much fact-checking it

8
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,120
Planet Money

9
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:42,752
We have the time and space to do this because we're apart of NPR because we're part of public radio

10
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,312
And we are really grateful for all of the

11
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,848
People who support NPR

12
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:52,992
Who make it possible for us to do our jobs and every year around this time of year we asked you guys to

13
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,576
Join this group of supporters and help keep public radio what it is

14
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:02,976
Curious and independent and factually accurate if you want to show your support for planet

19
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,224
Alright today's episode first aired back in 2013

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,856
It was reported by Caitlin Kenny and Robert Smith and we will have an update some fresh information for you at

21
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,696
If you try to see concert in the last few months

22
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
You may have had this

23
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Experience

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,536
Sandringham really wanted to see

25
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,304
Taylor Swift

26
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584
In Texas where she lives

27
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,144
So her husband computer

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
Waiting for the ticket

29
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
It's the moment they went on sale

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
They went on sale and

31
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
He told me

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
Waiting at a computer

33
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,616
Assume that he was a boy

34
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
Find the website

35
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
Get online

36
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,248
But he said as soon as he clicked on it they were gone he couldn't

37
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
She couldn't do any

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
He tried several times

39
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
Purchase them in

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,392
Was unable

41
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
Scott on eBay

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
What's for a while

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
Trying to find the best price

44
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
The best that he can

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,888
Come up with $500 for

46
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
And what was the face value of the

47
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,728
The tickets how much were they originally being sold for

48
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
They were under a house

49
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
And we paid about two

50
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Now think about this

51
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,200
Vanderham wanting to see Taylor Swift she loves Taylor Swift

52
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,760
But most of the money she spent on the concert

53
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
Was going to say

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
Who is not Taylor

55
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,112
Someone who just happened to buy the tick

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
Only thing I visit

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
Someone who was waiting on the internet

58
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
Because I knew that they were going to get

59
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Double the price

60
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
That person waiting to

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,864
Squeeze money out of true fans

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,728
What does the name scalper the situation because Sandra

63
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
She was happy

64
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
To pay the price that was asked

65
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
I need to think about the cost be

66
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Cuz it was so much

67
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,688
In fact I would probably spend that amount

68
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
It's not a little bit more again

69
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
Taylor Swift if you're listening

70
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
You price your tickets way too low

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
You left money on the table

72
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,880
And somebody else

73
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,024
Skipped it up scalping happens all the time in the music business

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,352
Shady guy standing on the street corner in front of the Arena

75

Ticketsnow

77
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,032
We live in a society where everyone is obsessed with making sure the Price Is Right

78
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
Supply matches demand

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,616
Entire industry

80
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:34,016
It routinely gets it wrong LOL

81
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:40,416
Today we're going to investigate why so much fan money goes into the pockets of people who can't eat

82
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Even play an

83
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,232
And we're going to talk to a man

84
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
We're somewhat of an expert about being scalped

85
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,584
Call me Kid Rock Bobby whatever you want

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376

Kid Rock first got big back in the late 1990s when he was known for combining Rock

100
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
And wrap here this

101
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
Huge hit called cowboy

Outsize personality

Back in the night

104
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,991
These days he's got more of a country Roxane going on in back in 2013

105
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
He just released a new album

106
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
What's a little bit of that

107
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
Show Kid Rock's on tour for the album

108
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
And the scalpers wanted a piece of the action

109
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
So we have to

110
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
So I actually looked

111
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
To see if I could find

112
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
StubHub for your show

113
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
Okay 780-3730

114
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,151
Before 490 like when people are willing to pay that much

115
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
Approached by

116
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
Scalpers in the underground

117
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
So we can make you $100,000 cash

118
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
Just give us a few of those from

119
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Rose forever show

120
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:15,647
Will never tell any

121
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
If you do a meet-and-greet

122
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
You can have 10 grand cash on the top of that

123
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Cash money

124
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
Is unreported money the government

125
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,887
So they say 10 that's 22 me cuz I paid

126
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
50 cents on the dollar

127
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,007
Can I meet so I can leave, we have to get out of here with that horse crap

128
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
Kid Rock is the name for the scalpers

129
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Wechat

130
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,383
He says they're making money off his back

131
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
And he's not happy with this

132
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,503
The thing is in some ways what he's doing

133
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Is encouraging it

134
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
Keep raising his tickets really low

135
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
The current touring get a ticket is cheap

136
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
As $20

137
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
He says he wants to do that to all his fans can attend

138
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
But these lower ticket prices

139
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
Those bring the scalp

140
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
So I asked him

141
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
Why not raise your prices

142
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,911
Why not charge more for your ticket

143
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
But wouldn't you rather go to Juventus

144
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,031
Scalpers I mean if people are willing to pay this much

145
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:04,799
To see you

146
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
Clearly they love you that much and it's worth it to them

147
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,479
Even though they would that's a big act late and I really appreciate that but I don't want to break you

148
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
You by coming to see me

149
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,063
And ask somebody sing songs about Working Class People

150
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
For them

151
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
I thought it was important to stand

152
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Why would I

153
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,999
Sing about what I preached in this day and age when you see so many people

154
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
Claim missing

155
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,119
This that and the other they charge a hundred $200 tickets

156
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
We got figure out who those people are

157
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
I want to make

158
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,519
I want to make as much money as I can but I wanted I don't need to drive around in

159
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
Turn it down Rolls Royce or Maybach

160
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,847
Hide from people

161
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
Because I felt like I ripped them off

162
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
Madonna

163
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
Rolling Stones

164
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
I mean come on

165
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,575
What do you think when you see like some of you about talk about the stones

166
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,855
They talk about you know that 5

167
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:55,231
$600 ticket price why if you were the greatest rock and roll bands in the world which they are

168
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
I truly love the stones 11

169
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,607
Why for the life of me if this may be their last tour

170
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
What they not go out

171
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
The coolest rock and roll band

172
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
Spike TV cheap tickets

173
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
The fast hey this is going to be our farewell

174
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
We appreciate it so many of you

175
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
People have supported this

176
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,943
4050 Holabird however many years it's been

177
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
If we're going to go out and get it

178
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
We're going to be so cool we're going to get a cheap Tech

179
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
Now that sounds

180
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Good in theory

181
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,879
But if the Rolling Stones sold a bunch of

182
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
$10 tickets to the concert

183
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
You know exactly what we

184
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
The scalpers

185
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
The problem is

186
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,047
When you have so many Cheap Trick

187
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
When you have a fan-friendly ticket price

188
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
Sometimes it actually makes it harder for

189
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Fans

190
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,679
To get those two

191
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
It's easy for somebody to buy it at that

192
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,823
Under undervalued price and then resell it at what the market really dictates

193
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
Jed Smith is the president of

194
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
Ticketmaster North America

195
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
And he said he sees this a lot

196
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
Artists like Bruce Springsteen

197
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,063
Pearl Jam Kid Rock you know that keeping it real they want a price ticket

198
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,855
It slows the fans go see the show

199
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
The Jared attic Master he has to remind

200
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
This may not

201
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
B

202
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
The best strategy

203
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,815
Because those fans standing in line or

204
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
We're trying to get on the computer to buy ticket

205
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
They're up against some very sophisticated

206
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
Heated scalp

207
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,287
Such as people who get up early and spend all night trying to get three or four tickets

208
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,871
These are scalpers who use sophisticated computer Pro

209
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,711
But they can scoop up as many tickets online as they can

210
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,039
Certainly on hot shows we see a ton of that activity

211
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,903
And we see even a ton of that activity you know for the best seats even on a medium

212
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,951
Medium demand show

213
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,767
Show images of how much money there is to be made

214
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,423
Some of these outfits are or incredibly sophisticated technologist minutes a little bit of a cat mouth

215
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Game for us because

216
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,007
Empty the ability to grab tickets at

217
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
Thunder Valley

218
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,335
The price is it is a huge incentive

219
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
The continue to pour money into the technology to fight

220
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,247
The defenses that somebody like Ticketmaster might throw in their in their way

221
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
There is huge money to be made doing this

222
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
Couple years ago the feds arrest

223
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
City size in California

224
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,903
Their company

225
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Wise Guys

226
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:07,071
And the whole business was to use complex computer systems to get around to get Masters limits

227
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,655
To try to gobble up as many tickets as I could and then resell them

228
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
And these guys

229
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,751
They said they made more than 25 million dollars doing

230
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
I feel like this is Battle of

231
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,847
The Titan so on one side we have Kid Rock

232
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,871
Rockstar

233
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
On the other side we have

234
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
These like scalpers

235
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
These new modern

236
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Hacker Scout

237
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,807
Kid Rock he doesn't want to raise his prices

238
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,135
The Wiseguys of the worldis Calpers

239
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,743
To take all his money money money that he was earning by sweating his butt off on stage

240
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
Well there is

241
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
A slightly devious way

242
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
To get around

243
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Is problem

244
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,447
You know who can get Kid Rock tickets really really cheap

245
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
And get a lot of Kid Rock tickets

246
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
Kid Rock

247
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
Back in the old days back when you know

248
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:55,199
This whole electronic ticketing things started happening and people start to trade and resell tickets

249
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,991
Online

250
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,807
Artist hat sort of a way around scalp

251
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,111
If they didn't want the scalpers to win then

252
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,391
They could be scalpers

253
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,975
There was an article Mossy journalism reporting couple years ago.

254
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,559
People are taking their own tickets and putting on step out and telling them at a higher price

255
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,887
So that they could get that extra money without getting the bad

256
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,935
I might even been guilty of that

257
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
I'm not sure because

258
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
I Didn't Do It consciously but I might have been

259
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,359
You know I've done might have happened I'm not for sure so I'm not going to say it didn't

260
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,407
And I'd be willing to bet it probably did

261
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,967
It was kind of thing when it first came out that's what you did

262
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,831
You know what I mean nobody was the wiser new just you know you Scout those tickets yourself and put that money in your pocket

263
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,391
People willing to pay for it it's like you're saying what's the matter

264
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,207
There's actually kind of a good business reason for doing this

265
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,279
For artists and musicians to be there on scalpers

266
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,607
I have to do with the complicated psychology of fans

267
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,911
And the way fans think about their relationships

268
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Two musicians

269
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,543
Remember Sandra ham paid $250 each for her Taylor Swift tickets

270
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
She says

271
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
Taylor herself wanted to charge that much

272
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
If I saw it on her website for

273
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
See I don't think everything

274
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,759
I don't think I could do that

275
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Why

276
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
IJustine

277
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
How much money is it good

278
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
Concert

279
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
I mean I know she's so popular but it's just

280
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Taylor Swift

281
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,351
But you paint it so sorry

282
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,935
It was worth it but I think it was the

283
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
Concept that

284
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Bias

285
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Delta ticket

286
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,151
So you guys paid like $150 over the face value of the ticket

287
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,223
Do you feel bad for Taylor Swift but she can get that money

288
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
No

289
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Expungement money

290
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,087
No it was a packed house

291
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,367
Sure

292
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
You know the system is

293
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
Screwed up

294
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
When 8

295
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
Taylor Swift

296
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,887
Fan would rather give money till you know a shady guy in the corner or someone she doesn't even know on the internet

297
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,655
Then give it to

298
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
Sweet lovable Taylor

299
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
Swift I mean that is the system

300
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
We have now and you can see how the artist

301
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
Would you little frustrated by this I mean

302
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
What did that guy ever do

303
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,151
In order to get the money

304
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
They want as much money as they pay

305
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,807
Yeah I mean you could see whether kind of shady dealing might be appealing but

306
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
Kid Rock says you know.

307
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Older he got

308
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
The longer he went through his career

309
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
Alas appealing it scene

310
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
Cheetahs

311
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
He didn't want to be a jerk

312
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,303
He want to make sure his fans could get his tickets for

313
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Fair price

314
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
The interesting thing is

315
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
I need the latest horror

316
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,959
He told me he's got all these new techniques

317
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,239
In the war against scalp

318
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:31,103
If a ceramic is Kid Rock when he talks about the sound a little bit like an economist he's

319
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
Really

320
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
Thinking about

321
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,943
The economics of tickets at one thing

322
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Scalpers to make money

323
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
There needs to be more demand for ticket

324
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Supply

325
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
Now if Kid Rock doesn't want to change

326
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
His prices

327
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Give another option

328
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
He can up the supply

329
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
Do more shows

330
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047
Some places where Kid Rock thinks he might sell out

331
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
That there might be more scalpers

332
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
Is adding lights

333
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
Doing eight shows in Detroit

334
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
There's twenty tzumi 20000 tickets sold

335
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,567
In Chicago over 20000 Indianapolis St Louis March 2nd show

336
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,687
In the future you know we might be blessed enough to look like hey God forbid we have to move this into a stadium

337
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
Kid Rock is flooding the market with himself

338
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Driving down price

339
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,343
But of course he knows that that alone will not.

340
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
Detert the scalpers

341
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,951
In a huge Stadium no matter the size there are still good seats

342
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
And that

343
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
And no matter

344
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
How many shows he does

345
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,351
There's always going to be a shortage of those really could see

346
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,215
Of the seats that people really want a giant Arena it actually makes

347
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
The proportion of bad seed

348
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
The Good Seed

349
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Even larger

350
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
Discover's know that they can take advantage of that

351
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
Kid Rock

352
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,175
We're going to Ticketmaster it got this second

353
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Yes

354
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
$20 seats for the masses

355
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
It's for the fans

356
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,599
The crank up the prices on those first 20 rosary

357
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Platinum pricing

358
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Is what it's called

359
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
We took a thousand tickets

360
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,279
And we price those whatever that that Sculpey marketware that secondary Market

361
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Determines it to be

362
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,167
You know where you literally like going on 17 what are people trying to prevent tickets and then determine the price

363
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
Not me personally but we have people to

364
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,031
They go and see what the markets determine your hip

365
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
People are looking for

366
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:08,895
Tickets in this guy's got them for sale for 250 we have tickets to the same spot

367
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
125

368
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:13,247
Okcu adjusting the price as you go through

369
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,575
Yeah there's no set price on the Platinum tickets it's whatever the market

370
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,647
Now he's still under pricing

371
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
The tickets

372
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,743
So the question that I had when I first heard this was

373
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
Why would a stopwatch

374
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,375
Buy up all those premium Platinum tickets that say like a hundred

375
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,399
$25

376
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
And then jacket

377
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Price even more

378
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Well

379
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
You got another trick for that

380
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
Paperless ticketing

381
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,871
When you show up to the show and you have one of these Platinum seats

382
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,919
You have to show drivers license

383
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
And swipe your credit card

384
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Already can't sit down

385
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,831
It still seems to be a little bit of a conflict of Kid Rock talks

386
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,135
All about oh it's about the people in about the

387
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Fan

388
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
And then he's got the premium

389
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,207
Pricing

390
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:59,839
We're by ghetto basically you're staring out into a sea of rich people in the first thousand seats

391
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Yeah he's worried about that

392
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,679
And that's why he has actually won last

393
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
Tweaked with pricing system

394
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
Samosa seated beside in the house 20 bucks

395
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,079
Premium seats near the front more expensive

396
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
But the first

397
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Two rows

398
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
No matter how much money you got

399
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
No matter how rich you are

400
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
You can't buy it

401
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Those seats

402
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Are chosen by Lottery

403
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
And they're going to go to people who paid for the chi

404
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
$20

405
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,951
I'm tired of seeing the old bridge guy in the front row with the hot girlfriend

406
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:32,351
Not girlfriend you know where their boobs hanging out with a beer in there to screaming the whole time and then the old rich guy stand there like he could care less

407
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
Three common themes

408
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,935
Kid Rock concerts

409
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,239
Probably most people's cops I've been a lot of artists

410
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,799
Yeah so it'll be nice to see

411
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
The people be able to have a real

412
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
The best shot at

413
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,151
I could give them a kitten Espino

414
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
The best tickets

415
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Just so I can picture

416
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,503
The optimum Kid Rock Show

417
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
There are

418
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,855
Breezy fans and Kid Rock t-shirts in the first two rows

419
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
And then behind that

420
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,975
There's a thousand seats of people in tuxedos all the rich folks

421
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,303
NF behind them filling up the rest of the Arena

422
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
Are a bunch of people who paid

423
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,631
$20 for their tickets

424
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:06,655
$20

425
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
Well I don't know what to text you this part

426
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,519
It's still a kid rock show but yes that is a general idea

427
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,823
And the sweet thing about this is that

428
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,383
Kid Rock knows that the people about the $20 tickets

429
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
They now have more money in their pocket

430
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
NetSpend

431
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
On beer

432
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Auntie shirt

433
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
And hot

434
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
And Kid Rock

435
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,319
You get to cut it at

436
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
You give people fairprice I think they'll be

437
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
Don't feel a little better about spending their money

438
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Anime

439
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,815
I might drink some more beer they might buy two t-shirts in might spend as much just because they don't

440
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
Feel like someone's trying to get over on

441
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,935
And all the pics you liked everything is transparent out in the open

442
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,007
And I'm going to make money off and I'm screaming this at other artists

443
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
I'm going to make

444
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
Money

445
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,407
You know that means and I'm happy to discuss it with any of you at any time

446
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,199
Mick Jagger Kid Rock Says call him

447
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
One last thing

448
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
We wanted to see

449
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
How well Kid Rocks

450
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,855
Plan his work at the scalpers is going and so

451
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:03,743
What way you can check to see how concert tours going anytime online so Caitlin ticket

452
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:14,495
All right here we go out so this is for a Kid Rock show on Saturday he's playing in New Jersey with Kool & the Gang and Uncle Kracker

453
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,871
We will be able to see all of the individual seats and which one have been sold in

454
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,407
This is one of the moment of

455
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
Truth because

456
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
If Kid Rock under prices

457
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,271
The tickets are too cheap

458
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:30,111
In a whole place will be sold out and will be scalpers standing outside

459
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Kid Rock

460
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Will lose money

461
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
But

462
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
Is Kid Rock

463
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:34,719
Overpriced

464
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
Discharging too much

465
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Then

466
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,119
The place is going to be half empty and if they're being very very sad show

467
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
So what are you looking at

468
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
Alright Mama Tracy regato queso

469
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
We got some

470
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:49,055
Tickets available here in the official Kid Rock Platinum seating

471
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:53,407
He looks like maybe just 5% of the seats still available in the very front

472
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,199
The median price seat in the middle

473
00:17:55,967 --> 00:18:02,111
Okay just new man out here sold out section 303 no seats available section for A2 no seats available

474
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
Now are there very

475
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Cheap tickets a Toyota tickets any of those left

476
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:10,815
All the way in the back yeah it looks like they're still a bunch in the very back of the venue

477
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,119
So from Kid Rock's perspective

478
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Economy Lumber

479
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:19,519
He's got a place to see me rock is going to be full but if you really want with the last minute you don't have to go to scalper

480
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
You can actually go to the fridge

481
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,383
Injured Smith from Ticketmaster if you told me that's what he likes

482
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
You know if you under price of tickets

483
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Too many go to quickly

484
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
A few left means

485
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
They got pretty close to the right price

486
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:37,695
After the break Taylor Swift does something that Kid Rock

487
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
Wasn't even willing to try

488
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,583

That episode was originally reported back in 2013

499
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:19,679
The next year Taylor Swift released an album and then she went on a world tour to

500
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Promoted

501
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,311
Something like 30% of those tickets ended up on reselling websites like StubHub

502
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
Which means she priced her ticket

503
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,711
Sue Taylor Swift was facing exactly the same sort of problem Kid Rock

504
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,271
If she sold her tickets at a reasonable price

505
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,831
Scalpers would buy him up and then sell them at a profit

506
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,367
But at the same time

507
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
Not a lot of artists want to make their tea

508
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
Too expensive because fans don't like that

509
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
It's not good for the brand

510
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,095
Kid Rock had his strategies to solve this like raffling off front row tickets

511
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,911
But Taylor Swift did the thing that kid rock refused

512
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
To do she just raised her ticket prices

513
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,239
Some of the seats cost

514
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
Hundreds of dollars

515
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,359
She raised the prices so high that some of her shows didn't sell out

516
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
Which for a pop Superstar

517
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
Seems worrying

518
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,759
But Taylor Swift apparently thinks like an economist

519
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,807
Do you know selling just enough that if you see

520
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:12,159
Seats are left empty that is a sign that you're pretty close to the true market price

521
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,951
That's how an economist would see it

522
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:20,607
And this is the thing that more and more artists are doing their setting ticket prices closer to what they're going for on reselling website

523
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,679
That is according to David Marcus

524
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,775
IMed Executive Vice President and head of Music at Ticketmaster

525
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:28,543
He says yes

526
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
This is a thing that has changed

527
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
Since 2003

528
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
I think there's no question that

529
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:38,015
The sense that fans are exposed to these prices and these other marketplaces

530
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
And are willing to

531
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
Pay those prices

532
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,647
Is making artist more comfortable with charging hose price

533
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,999
Taylor Swift actually had a second part of her strategy and it worked like this

534
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,047
Before tickets went on sale she had

535
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,631
Add fans log onto an online portal and register with your email at

536
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,543
Ticketmaster then ran those email addresses through an algorithm and that algorithm made a judgment on whether it's a deer

537
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,639
Dear John 1998 at hotmail.com is an actual fan

538
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,943
Or is a scalper

539
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
You get through the algorithm

540
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,271
Get access to reasonably priced

541
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:14,879
So that was a plan raise prices on the general public and Target actual

542
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,232
And Taylor Swift plan to beat the scalpers seems to actually work

543
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,584
