1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,536
Hey guys

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,560
Couple things

3
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,888
The show is a rerun we originally reported it into that

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,912
15th

5
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,960
Also it Future Sailors and

6
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,496
People who curse like sailor

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,800
Think of a delicious fish

8
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,592
And Marco Hagerty

9
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
Has caught

10
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,408
I've trolled for salmon

11
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:21,248
Avada Hearing fished up here and Dungeness

12
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,016
Crab

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
And

14
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,832
Halibut

15
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,648
I meant Maca on the pier in Homer Alaska

16
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,208
You got these great big bushy eyebrows

17
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,536
Albert Einstein hair tucked behind a Black Beret

18
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,816
Michael loves the

19
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
Competitive

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
Thrill

21
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,400
And Alaska used to be the most

22
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
Competitive place of all

23
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,472
Fishing season would open on a

24
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496
Certain day

25
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,520
And it was a race

26
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,568
A race to get your boat out in the water

27
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
I get all the fish

28
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,896
The whole Harbor would just be a buzz

29
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:55,552
And there were a lot of people beating the docks looking for jobs in there were lot of boats participating in the fish

30
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,832
Shree and it was

31
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,416
Wide-open nobody was limited into how much they could

32
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,976
To catch they were only limited and how much time they could

33
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,816
Spend people made a good living which attracted more

34
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,400
And all together everyone is catching more and more fish

35
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,472
So in order to protect that fish population

36
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
This season got

37
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,264
Shorter and

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
And shorter in 1970

39
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,384
Season for halibut with 150 days long

40
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
Then it was shortened to 100 days

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,248
And by the early 1990s

42
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
It was 20

43
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
4 hours

44
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
20

45
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
4 Hour opening

46
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
It's just a few times a year

47
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
Just imagine how intense this

48
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488
These fishermen are trying to earn their

49
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
Higher your salary

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
And a handful of

51
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
24-hour Sprint

52
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,376
It became known as the derby

53
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912
An all-out race to fish

54
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,776
And back then you would see thousands and thousands of boats all going out to

55
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
Everything that's loaded wood now

56
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
Out in the right kind of shape and the wrong kind of shape

57
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,712
That was a open-access and people had

58
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,552
Everybody was involved in you'd have skips go out

59
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,368
We had the sinkings

60
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
But if you wanted to make money

61
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
You had to go

62
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
You went out if you were sick

63
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,976
You went out of sweater

64
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Vici boat

65
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
You went out

66
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Phoenix.

67
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
You know what you're doing

68
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
You went out there were dark clouds

69
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
Threatening on the rise

70
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,728
And even if the weather was good and the fishing was good

71
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
You overloaded your boats during the Derby Days

72
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
And that man

73
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
Your boat might sink

74
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,432
The 24-hour Derby made fishing in Alaska one of the most deadly jobs

75
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
In the country

76
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
Fisherman has higher death rates

77
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Firefighters

78
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
Pilots

79
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,064
Police officers

80
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Finally someone said

81
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
Have to figure out a better way to do

82
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm just checking the other show how fishing went from deadly to

83
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Well saver

84
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
The solution was not about getting better gear or

85
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
Better Warning Systems

86
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
It was an economic fix

87
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,824
One that could help solve much bigger problem

88
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,200

99
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736

100
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:39,136
Pleasures it's just electric and the dangers there should nothing more Gary of trying to live

101
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
Between Two Worlds

You can find invisibilia on NPR one or wherever you get your pot

103
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
So you have to ask

104
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
What kind of person

105
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
Would go out in a tiny little boat

106
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
In miserable dangerous weather

107
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,496
The catch fish for

108
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
For 24 hours

109
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Everyone

110
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
Everyone in Homer Alaska

111
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,896
You can pretty much grab anyone on the fish.

112
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
And they would tell you these

113
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
Crazy stories about the Derby Days

114
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
Like I met Kurt Van Doren

115
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
He goes by the name

116
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
Carcass carcass

117
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:12,416
Cow looks like a carcass he's wiry thin with crazy hair

118
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,696
And he's a dick

119
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,488
He works on other people's boats

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
Has told me

121
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
The reason the Derby got so dangerous

122
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,655
It's because the government chose what day it was

123
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
Months in advance

124
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,215
Way beforehand

125
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
They didn't know the weather when they chose

126
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
The day and that meant the weather could be really bad and you would

127
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
Still go out

128
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
Chris remembers one

129
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,663
Really bad day

130
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,199
Well I was on watch

131
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
And I'm just sitting up there I think

132
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,807
Man this is a 1912 old wood boat

133
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:44,159
How nice the boat was taking these ways were in like 45 to 50 Footers

134
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:49,535
And when I mean you're huge and it's a little 52 football Tree in curlers you know

135
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,863
We're going home and all and I'm going out and taking a pretty nice

136
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
Feeling pretty good

137
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,495
He's doing so good because the fishing had been really really great

138
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
And that man

139
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,079
He was going to get his share of that cats and he thought

140
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,383
She could get about $15,000

141
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
He even picked out what

142
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
He's going to buy

143
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
A new truck

144
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
So that's what he's thinking but the next week

145
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,087
All of a sudden we took one and we're not coming back up

146
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
Real buried

147
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903

148
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927

Bismarck was the skipper

151
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
It doesn't seem like we're coming back

152
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
The next wave hit us and we just leaned right over

153
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,143
And it's like

154
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,703
Martian get everybody the fox out we're going down

155
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,007
Perkis grab the crate with the life raft

156
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,031
And popped it open

157
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
And a big wave came up

158
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,639
Wash the liferaft overboard the brand new one

159
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,431
Laurel Market

160
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,015
Discovery we still got the old one is released when we pull the release

161
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
It's stuck in the crate

162
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,367
We're trying to break down a crate when you're off

163
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,671
Find polling we're all in water up to her waist

00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
I mean we're talking big smokers

165
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
Big wave

166
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
The carcasses were 50 ft

167
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Hi

168
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,607
The wind was blowing a hundred miles per hour

169
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,143
And they decide to jump

170
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
Swim for that Lifeboat

171
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
I was being Swept Away

172
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
They hauled themselves inside

173
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
And the first thing we hear is called

174
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
Louchem pig crossword

175
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,175
Umar has been together in form and route for four people in it

176
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711

Now we here. Oncoming right away

Aroma going my God is good

So now we start locking our arms

180
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
Around each other

181
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
Showing their waves hit

182
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
When I don't

183
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
Bash into each other

184
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
Now we here

185
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
It's the Coast Guard airplane

186
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,191
And I'll tell you the most beautiful sound in the world is a C-130

187
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
That's when you really think you're going to

188
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
Carcass and the three other guys they all make it back

189
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
They all survived

190
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
They just don't have the fish anymore they don't have

191
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
The money and the carcass

192
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
Not getting any

193
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,295
But the crazy thing about carcasses

194
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,391
She goes back every year he told me he thinks five times

195
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,719
Five ships of God out under carpet

196
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Still goes back

197
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,815
What cities do not go out with turkey

198
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
I will

199
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
You know I've been to Alaska

200
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
And

201
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
You talk to these guys

202
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,031
End of bravado really is

203
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
Stunning the ability to just

204
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
Keep going out and

205
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,455
Enemies has so many people and even old-time fisherman

206
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
Like Clem tillion

207
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
He's 90 years old and he fish for decades

208
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
She was looking at all these thinking

209
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
And just wondering

210
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Why

211
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Young man loves you

212
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,839
Axon the excitement it was going black Las Vegas you went roaring out of the storms and you caught all you can

213
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Caption

214
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
The guy is a

215
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
Took the most risk

216
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Chuck Bluff

217
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:36,959
1 a.m.

218
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,031
They went looking at anything else

219
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Except

220
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
The fun of it

221
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Klamathon the Fisheries Council

222
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
His job was to help

223
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Suzhou population

224
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
24-hour Derby

225
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
Was in fact

226
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
Really good at protecting fish

227
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
Because the catch was limited

228
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,903
By the number of minutes of the day no one was overfishing

229
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,975
But he started to worry that the rules the government

230
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Set up

231
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,559
We're basically encouraging all these young men

232
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
And there were real consequences

233
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
3000 fisherman that went out

234
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
We didn't make it back

235
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
It was a very stupid sister

236
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
It was

237
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
Murder By government you might say

238
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,639
Order by governor

239
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
Yes

240
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
And

241
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,503
A few of us were looking at other ways of doing it

242
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
There was an idea out there

243
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,831
A way to protect the fish

244
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
And make fishing safer

245
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,439
Instead of limiting the amount of time people

246
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
Limit the total amount of fish that

247
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Could be caught

248
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
If you were fishermen

249
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,559
It's been having two fish

250
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,351
Any 24-hour Sprints is

251
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Is crazy race

252
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
Clinton wanted a system where would be

253
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Basically leisurely

254
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,007
Because each fishermen would be guaranteed

255
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
A certain amount of fish

256
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
The beginning of the season

257
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
It was this simple solution

258
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,711
But anytime you distribute something valuable you know people are going to fight

259
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,295
The cat should be distributed among boat owners

260
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
And Captain

261
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,879
Please remember basically halibut is

262
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Money

263
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
If you live in Alaska. That's how you make your living

264
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,767
I thought that the cat should be distributed among

265
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
Boat owners in

266
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,839
And his thinking was

267
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,911
Those are the people who have invested a lot of money in

268
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,727
Monkey rental they should reap the reward

269
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,031
But when guys like carcass heard about this

270
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Pissed

271
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
Carcass de novo

272
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
He was a deckhand

273
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,431
He worked on someone else's boat

274
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,455
Hauling in the fish

275
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
And risking his

276
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,063
And it was a real ridiculous thing to each one of us crew members

277
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
Shouldn't have got our share of it you know what it's like

278
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,951
The owners knew what was going on the owners

279
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
Kept it to themselves

280
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
You could see why they would be

281
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,375
You so upset under the old 24-hour Derby system

282
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
The fish what's the

283
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
People who worked

284
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
The heart

285
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,239
The people took the most chances

286
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
That's what the frontier mentality

287
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
But now the government was coming

288
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
And saying

289
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
You are winners

290
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
And your loser

291
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
Boat owners who the winners

292
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
The boaters were going to be

293
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,295
And the deckhands like carcass they weren't going to get

294
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Anything

295
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
They're being left out of the system

296
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
They could fish and they could still work

297
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,719
But they weren't going to get a guaranteed share of the

298
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
The catch so you can understand why

299
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
The losers the deck hands

300
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Basically confronted the fish react

301
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
They confronted Clem tillion

302
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
Mass demonstrations on sometime

303
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:23,615
My niece had her tires slashed in my kids got beat up in the playground I mean it was Island

304
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
Your kids got beat up

305
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
Yeah because the other way with two limbs kids you know

306
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
Amda

307
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
I was just

308
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,831
One of the things that happened

309
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,647
When people don't like something they can get

310
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
Pretty mad about it

311
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Especially when it's their livelihood

312
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,535
And I was rearranging their whole livelihood

313
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,863
The Clement and the Fisheries council did look at other ways

314
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
That could be considered more

315
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
They are they looked at a lottery

316
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
System where everyone gets in

317
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,495
Equal chance

318
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Or an auction

319
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,591
Where the permits went to the highest bidder

320
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,919
But no one wanted to pay for something that they had always gotten for

321
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
And so with no better option

322
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
Clam drafted the proposal

323
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Guess what they're going to do

324
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,855
Fish scientist would estimate how many halibut there were in the sea

325
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
How many cookies

326
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
The cot

327
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,695
Then the Boat Owners would each get a share of the fish

328
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
More race

329
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
Derby

330
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
He went into effect in 1995

331
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
And when I visited Homer Harbor

332
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,423
You could see how different it was compared to those Derby Days

333
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
Will have that right after this break

334
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311

When I wanted to go out fishing

348
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
I didn't have to wake up

349
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Super early

350
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
I didn't have to race

351
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
I just called up a boat owner and

352
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
She said I could come anytime

353
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
No rush

354
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
So this is about

355
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
As you can see this is a work boat

356
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,775
It's Nathan

357
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
Not just for show

358
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
No

359
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:35,455
This is Christy and David Frey they own the boat the realest

360
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,015
The realist as in

361
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,063
Fishing reel

362
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:41,855
Realistic

363
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:47,999
And they tell me they have 1700 pounds of halibut to fish

364
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,791
That's our quota for the whole year

365
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
Nf3 specific 1700 how they come up

366
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
The government looked at

367
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,703
How much fish the fries caught in those older

368
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
And they took an average and use that to calculate their share

369
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
Not easier to enforce

370
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:07,455
A time limit 24 hours then is to enforce over specific number like 17 lb of halibut

371
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
How do they enforce

372
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,295
David says they're BB's federal agents

373
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
From Noah

374
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
And they would police the dock

375
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,903
When they implemented this system

376
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
They just figured everybody was going to be

377
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Criminal I guess

378
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
So that brought

379
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
So that mean had

380
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,631
Blackjack

381
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Sonic

382
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Gun lights

383
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,519
You know come down to my boat on my boat with a damaged gun

384
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,615
What Jagged lucky you didn't go in the water

385
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
You're damn lucky I was

386
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,671
Alaskans are bigger to their freedom and I'm sure at first this fishing quota

387
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
Do you like this

388
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,023
Like straight jacket on what they did on the whole

389
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Freedom

390
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Swashbuckling fishing thought

391
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,911
People were not into it at first

392
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,727
Hatsune fisherman saw the advantages

393
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,311
If the weather is bad they could just stay at home

394
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,847
Cigna at the Manor and going like

395
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
That there is no way

396
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:13,247
And it goes further than that if you don't want to fish all season

397
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
You can take a break and Lease out your quota

398
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
You can have someone else fishing

399
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:21,439
And Dave and Christy have basically double the amount of fish that they can catch

400
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
Buy leasing out other people share

401
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:30,399
That sounds like a good time

402
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
Start the Fry's Drive the boat out of the harbor Christie suits up put on this orange rain slicker

403
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,359
And she puts a few cans of Redbull in the cooler

404
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
David beats the Herring and salmon octopus.

405
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:52,159
I call it a salad

406
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:57,023
The gear goes into the water

407
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:03,423
And a few miles of line with hundreds of schools out to the Bottom of the Sea we're out for about 8 hours

408
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,215
And it's so cold

409
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
You don't see another

410
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
Commercial fishing boat

411
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
For the whole day

412
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,871
And that by the way is the whole point of the new sister

413
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,455
Now that people can trade or sell away their quotas

414
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
Temple donors have taken this

415
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Easy money

416
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
They've given their fish to someone else

417
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
And have totally gotten out of the business

418
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,207
The number of fishing boats is only a third of what it was before

419
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
And the theory is

420
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,815
The only people left are the best and most efficient

421
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:37,215
Picture of it

422
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:45,919
Repeat that the club know they're like one big muscle trying to like

423
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
Get out of the boat

424
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
The Fighter

425
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,951
Christie puts a knife through the guilt

426
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,999
And then quickly remove the gut

427
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
She said in the past

428
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
During the Derby Days

429
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,607
Should have time to take care of the fish like this

430
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Just threw all the fish on ice

431
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,423
And Hope

432
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
Everything stayed fresh

433
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,775
So it's better to get it on the boat it is so much better

434
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
She says it's more delicious

435
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,615
Okay so the Halibut quota system

436
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,431
Seems to be doing exactly what it's designed to do

437
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Delicious

438
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Preventing overfishing

439
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,831
And the death rate for fishermen United match of the top-of show has

440
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:30,207
And in some ways this is a beautiful model for managing any scarce

441
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,303
This is exactly what we're talking about when you came back from Alaska that

442
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
This model

443
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,887
Did they have for resources in Alaska is it

444
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
Pretty good model for something like

445
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Climate change

446
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,983
Everything limit amount of

447
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
Pollution a limited amount of carbon that we should let out of the war

448
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
Every question really is

449
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
How do you allocate

450
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
Should we give pollution credits to

451
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
Factories in China or two

452
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,015
People are commuting in LA

453
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,855
It's essentially the same question as they faced in Alaska which is how do you take

454
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,903
Something that everyone wants

455
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
And

456
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Divvy up

457
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
Go to Fairway in a way that doesn't make people

458
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Terribly upset

459
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
The key question is

460
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Fairness

461
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
And you can see from the Alaska case

462
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,423
It is really hard it took

463
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
20 years for the fisherman to get used to this system

464
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:19,103
And it was only a couple thousand of them and they still Grumble about how it All Shook out

465
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,175
Well they are fishermen and fishermen who grumble

466
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,503
For a living even the people who are winners under this scenario who got the

467
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
The fish allocation

468
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Can go out 3

469
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
Long fishing rod

470
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,879
It's only the fish jump into the boat

471
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
I mean it still

472
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
At its core

473
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,719
I really

474
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Call job

475
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,047
When I went out with Christy and David

476
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:41,375
They only caught 6 steps the whole day

477
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
The thing is now

478
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
They can go out tomorrow

479
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:50,079
I guess we'll see what happens eternal optimist

480
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,575
For the record just did bring back some smoked fish

481
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
It was delicious

482
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:08,511
