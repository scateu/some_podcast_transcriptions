1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,816
So so you know how to milk a cow by hand

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:03,584
Oh yeah

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,864
Oh yeah yeah

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,936
Andy novakovic spent his Summers as a kid working on

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,704
His grandparents

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,240
Dairy farm in Wisconsin

7
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,104
And he's still in the dairy world he is now a dairy Economist at Cornell University

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,152
What percentage of

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,968
Economist would you say are able to milk a cow by hand

10
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Well probably you know close to 100% or able but 99.9% wouldn't have the fog

11
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
How to get started in the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises

12
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,304
This is about the rat

13
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,352
And Andy had a ring sights

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,400
This is one of those

15
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
Slow-moving

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,192
Trainwreck

17
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,240
That you can see coming from a mile away

18
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,848
It was 1976 Jimmy Carter was running for president

19
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,664
And he started floating this idea

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,184
What are the ways Carter proposed giving farmers in

21
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,512
Raise the price of milk by about six sense

22
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
Per gallon

23
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:12,192
It was kind of a lot of the time now it's really was on the edge of that it was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign price

24
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,008
Promises that you really didn't expect they would actually be

25
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
Fulfill still campaign promise

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,336
That's what we call those

27
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,640
This was not just political panda

28
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,224
There is an argument that our country has to be able to produce

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
Its own food

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,296
Cuz if our Farmers go out of

31
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,368
Business and we become reliant on other countries for food

32
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,928
Then that is the kind of National Security risk

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,256
It's our country has a tradition of programs to help

34
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
What do you need to Vacaville

35
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
Is it is one thing to

36
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
To provide

37
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
Stability

38
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
It is another to step into the market in

39
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
In a big way at maybe the wrong time

40
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
Playing with price controls

41
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
Is playing with fire

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Nevertheless

43
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,640
When Carter got elected

44
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
He goes all

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,736
The retail price of milk

46
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,808
Is going up more than $0.06 a gallon soon

47
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
It's going up because the

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,392
Ngu you hear of it and

49
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,952
Do you like smack your forehead oh boy

50
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,768
Here we go it was pretty hard to predict

51
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,840
That it would get as bad as it got

52
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
But every Instinct I had said that I meant so sure this is going to work out so well

53
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,640
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen Duffin and I'm Kenny Malone

54
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,200
Today on the show The Story of what happened when

55
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
President of the United States

56
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,808
Decided he was going to help America's farmers

57
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
White buying milk

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Lots of milk

59
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,464
It is a case study in what happens when price controls

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,536
Run full-speed into the realities of the market

61
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:45,632
There will be a cave in Kansas City a van down by the river

62
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
And a touching Exchange

63
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
Between Martha Stewart

64
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
And Snoop Dogg

65
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
Where do you buy government

66
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:58,432
You don't buy it you got to be on a special mailing list

. org

76
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,544
So it's 1977

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,592
Jimmy Carter has announced his plan to help

78
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,920
Farmers in Congress is like wait no we also love the farm

79
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,968
Pennsylvania pass a law saying

80
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,784
But they want the price of milk to go up automatically

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Every six

82
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,600
It's one thing for politicians

83
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,160
How to say we want the price of milk to go up

84
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
But

85
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
The government then actually have to figure out a way to

86
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Step into the

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,816
This market and make it happen

88
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
So it is fundamental economics

89
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
Again are dairy economist

90
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,776
You got two levers you can pull on you can do something to make

91
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Demand greater

92
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
Or you going to do something to make

93
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Supply less

94
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,456
Either one should get you a higher price

95
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,736
Lever1

96
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Lower the supply

97
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,600
You could do what they do in Canada and say hate no more milk

98
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
Can only produce

99
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
So much mail

100
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,208
But this is America we don't do milk

101
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Quotas

102
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,256
No lever1

103
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,791
Okay lover 2

104
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
More demand

105
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,911
You can try to convince the public that they want to drink more milk

106
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
Does it look delicious right glass

107
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
Easier solution Maybe

108
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
The government could

109
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
Just start buying a ton of milk themselves

110
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,919
Yeah this was generally the approach

111
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
That we would use to support other kinds of farm into

112
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Is the government

113
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Goodbye up

114
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Play massive amounts of

115
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
Corn or wheat

116
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,903
And then just throw it into a silo until we needed it

117
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
For some reason

118
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
But that does not work for me

119
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,631
Because milk starts going bad the minute it comes out of the cow fell so mostly water so you got to haul it around

120
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
And in those like

121
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
Gas tankers

122
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,519
The federal government wouldn't have the foggiest idea what to do with

123
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,799
Tanker loads

124
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:06,431
Of milk what would the government do if you drove this into downtown Washington and said here you go

125
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:12,575
So the clever Folks at USDA said what if we went down the supply chain one step

126
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
And looked at

127
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
Dairy products

128
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,439
That are storable

129
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
So the basic question was

130
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,583
What kinds of milk products can the government buy and store

131
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:26,399
Butter was one nonfat dry milk

132
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,423
And

133
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,471
Cheese and in particular

134
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,495
Shutter type

135
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:35,871
Soca raise the price of milk the government basically opened up the world's largest

136
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,895
Cheese shop

137
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
Powder milk and barbecue

138
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
So the the way this program work

139
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Literally

140
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Is

141
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
The federal government

142
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,623
Put on a piece of paper that says

143
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,183
We will buy as much

144
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
Cheese butter or nonfat dry milk

145
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
As you want to sell to us

146
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,071
At these prices

147
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
Our operators are standing by

148
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
Let us know

149
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
The USDA figured out that if

150
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
They paid about 39 bucks

151
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
For a 40 lb block of cheese

152
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,823
But it would have this ripple effect

153
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,871
Government buys more cheese

154
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Cheese makers buy more milk

155
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,199
And the resulting demand just

156
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
Pushes the price of

157
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
The government is creating a price

158
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
And in order to do this

159
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
They have to be willing to buy

160
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Oliver

161
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
Anybody wants to sell them

162
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,463
At this price

163
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:28,607
And if you're a cheese Cellar and you hear this that someone's going to buy your cheese at this high price you're like

164
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
Minnesota my crappy is cheese at that price

165
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,983
So to prevent this the government said look

166
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,775
If we're going to buy your cheese

167
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,823
First you have to meet with Bob

168
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Yes

169
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,151
I started in 1967

170
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,175
With us

171
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,479
50a and I was hired as a cheese grater

172
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
You were hired someone to show up with a metal snake

173
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
A grater

174
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
We're used to do quality checks on

175
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,671
This must be a common confusion in the Indus

176
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
Yeah greater yeah

177
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
Bob Asher Brock

178
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
Was one of the government's cheese grater

179
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
He spent 30 years

180
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,399
Testing and tasting cheese for the United States

181
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,959
State government yes this is a real job

182
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
It sounds amazing

183
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,591
Are you pretty annoying to eat cheese with like are you the most picky cheese eater

184
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
In your group of friends

185
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
I am absolutely not

186
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
I will eat any cheese

187
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,271
In fact if you seen my shape you would know that I eat enough

188
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551
To keep the tank full

189
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
Bob's

190
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,391
Job was to make sure that all of the cheese met

191
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
USDA grade-a

192
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Cheddar stand

193
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,559
The right moisture level the proper shade of yellowish-orange

194
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
The correct flavor

195
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,423
Profile so if you wanted to sell cheese to the government Bob would show up

196
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
With this life

197
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
Halo Rod called

198
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
Cheese Trier

199
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,823
And you inserted into the block or the barrel or whatever

200
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,871
Turn it and you pull out a core of cheese

201
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,919
The core sample of cheese

202
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:51,807
And that's what you grade and they're 17 flavor defects that could happen in cheddar cheese

203
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:57,439
If I can tell you what we had a rejected for flat bitter you Steve multi old milk

204
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
Rudy Rudy

205
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
That sounds great taste like apples

206
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,071
That sounds lovely you don't want that no

207
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,655
Comet Alex our way tank weedy onion Barney

208
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,191
Lipase and sulfite

209
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
And you can taste all of those things in a piece

210
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
You betcha

211
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,103
Bob says the number one flavor defect he had to look out for

212
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
What's acidity

213
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
It was allowed

214
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Not too much

215
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Penny White

216
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,735
The government had its plan in play

217
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
Play Spit was ready to start buying cheese

218
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,551
And it took

219
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
A few years

220
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,879
But a flood of cheese starts

221
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
So much cheese

222
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
That Bob

223
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Starts having

224
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
To spend more and more time on the road because he has to

225
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,327
Go to the cheese to grate it

226
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,887
His colleagues are drowning in cheese

227
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,703
And they go to their bosses they like we need more cheese graters

228
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
Until they try to hire more

229
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:49,151
I travel 39 States and I was gone as long as 10 weeks at a time doing that so getting people to do it

230
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
Was always a challenge

231
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:57,343
The young people do they say it while I can't go out with a girl or I can't go out with a guy because I'm on the road all the time who's got time for

232
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
Dating when you're traveling around eating

233
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,951
Now I think she's eating is better than dating

234
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,791
I don't disagree with you I don't disagree with you

235
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
More graders

236
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,863
Grading more cheese

237
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,399
Is that the government then buys

238
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,959
But then we had that issue was storing stuff

239
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,263
I mean every Warehouse in Wisconsin was

240
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
All our area around to everybody hits

241
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Even though

242
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Beverage dist

243
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
Distributors

244
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
They had Jesus

245
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:27,807
I mean we have cheese and every Cold Storage in the United States including the caves in Kansas that were full of it

246
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:29,599
The caves

247
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
In Kansas

248
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
Yeah

249
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,439
The underground caves

250
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,255
The government of the United States of America

251
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,535
Had caves

252
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Full

253
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
Of cheddar cheese

254
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,423
And when news gets out that the government is filling a

255
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
A cave with

256
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Cheese

257
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
The Press goes nuts

258
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
Because this is exactly what

259
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
People think of when they think of a government program gone awry

260
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,663
Like this is the original bridge to nowhere

261
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
This is a cave

262
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Full of cheese

263
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
In Kansas City

264
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Can I had to

265
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,951
Of course you did

266
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,279
I am currently about 35 feet underground

267
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,095
In an old converted Limestone mine

268
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
It is the size

269
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,191
Of 120

270
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:16,959
Football field

271
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
Government cheese

272
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
That's pretty good

273
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
You don't do that huh

274
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,151
I've never thought about it this is Dan Callahan

275
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
He's been working here since the 1970s

276
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Since the cheese Dubai

277
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,551
And he tells me these were never government-owned

278
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
But one day

279
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,391
I rented out a ton of cave space

280
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,231
And then cheddar cheese started to show up massive blocks of the stuff

281
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
How it after palette in fact

282
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
Do you remember the exact room it went into

283
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Oh yeah

284
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
We walk inside massive columns

285
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
It looks like something

286
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,799
The Lord of the Rings dwarves bill

287
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
And it is also very cold

288
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
Good for the government cheese

289
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
Haha

290
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,295
17 feet 16b then says the cheese took up about

291
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
An acre

292
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,111
Bullock space

293
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Suggest

294
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Wall2wall

295
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
Florida L'Oreal

296
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,047
And then as you kept feeling that you just worked your way right back out

297
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,351
Until there's no more room for you to be in this room right

298
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,423
By the early 1980s the dairy Support Program

299
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
With costumes

300
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,007
Taxpayers around 2 billion dollars a year

301
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,871
The government was buying one in every four pounds of a country's cheddar cheese

302
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,943
They actually had to rent out space in multiple cat

303
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,223
At one point

304
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
The government was storing

305
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
2 lb of cheese for every

306
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,575
Single Americans

307
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
By this point

308
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
Jimmy Carter was out of office

309
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
And the Ronald Reagan team was stuck

310
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Dealing with you

311
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Cheese

312
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,791
And not all of it with aging well

313
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
There was an in

314
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
Credible press conference

315
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
Agriculture sector

316
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
Teri Jon block went before reporters

317
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,751
And held up a giant hunk of cheese

318
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
Like it was a national emergency

319
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
You see that

320
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Steak and cheese

321
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
We've got six

322
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
A million of these

323
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,735
Shut the government down

324
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,015
What's mole

325
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
Is deteriorating

326
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
We can't find a market for

327
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
Finding a market for this

328
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
Stuff is in fact a pretty fascinating

329
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,047
Because it's getting rid of government surplus

330
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
Anyting

331
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
Is an economically

332
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Tricky thing

333
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,215
Exactly so the thing that the government was concerned about is what's called commercial this

334
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
Again Economist andina Vacaville

335
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,639
And he says the government could not just release a flood of surplus cheese on

336
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,919
Into the market because it would

337
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Crushed cheese producer

338
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,063
Jeep imagined the cheese company that's in the business selling cheese is going to say

339
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,391
What's the deal are you took away my customer is as you know important to me

340
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
This leaves a couple of options

341
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,231
You could destroy the Surplus but

342
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
That was pretty bad

343
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,327
Or you can try to get your Surplus Goods

344
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,399
Two people who were not going to buy it anyway

345
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
And that's you won't be

346
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
The flooding anyone's Market

347
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,311
When we have a surplus of grain or soy or even powdered

348
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,871
We can send that stuff overseas

349
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,895
As part of foreign

350
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
But she's

351
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
Just doesn't travel well

352
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
So the government gave a bunch

353
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,271
Schools

354
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
The army

355
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
This was not putting

356
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,391
Even a dent in the Surplus

357
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
So they created a brand new

358
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
Special program

359
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,767
To give the cheese away through Food Bank

360
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
The idea was that

361
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
If you give this food

362
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,119
Do people who suffer from food in

363
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
Security

364
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,215
Then maybe it is going to go to somebody who wasn't going to buy

365
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
So you're not hurting the market

366
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,079
But the problem Andy says

367
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
Was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese

368
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,943
There were 40 lb

369
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Block that

370
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,503
500lb Barrel

371
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,855
So you can imagine you know you're not just going to roll down one of these barrels down

372
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
7th Avenue in New York City and say anybody wants

373
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,511
You just have a big knife help yourself

374
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
So instead the cheddar cheese was processed

375
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
That helps it keep longer

376
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
And then it was repackaged in

377
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
2 + 5 lb like

378
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
Bricks and

379
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,799
This is what people will remember as Government

380
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:09,663
When a government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese

381
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,687
People notice

382
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,783
The great cheese giveaway began today in California

383
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,647
San Francisco is one of three cities in which needing people lined up to get the Surplus cheese

384
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,671
This footage

385
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Is amazing

386
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:25,535
Massive crowds of people being handed bricks of cheese and it's

387
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:30,143
The most government packaging you will ever see just like brown cardboard some

388
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,191
Black USDA stamps on it

389
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,519
State official estimated 300000 people

390
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
Will get a taste of today's

391
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
It is this moment

392
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
The government cheese

393
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,431
Truly enters the American pledge

394
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
As we unloaded the caves

395
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,759
Full of this stuff

396
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
Government cheese started to show up everywhere

397
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
Food banks

398
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Schools

399
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,183
Military mess halls for a lot of people who grew up in

400
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
1970s

401
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,303
80s you cannot overstate how influential government cheese

402
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,375
We're ready for you

403
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,935
Many listeners may remember Saturday Night Live

404
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,727
Matt Foley has played by

405
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
Chris Farley the

406
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,287
World's worst motivation

407
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,615
I'm here to tell you that you're going to end up

408
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
Eating a steady diet of government cheese

409
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,271
I'm living in a van down by the river

410
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Government cheese

411
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,343
Starts to show up in all kinds of

412
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,367
Popular culture

413
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,415
A short story by Junot Diaz

414
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:29,023
Clear the government cheese from the refrigerator if the girls government cheese also shows up in

415
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Tons of song

416
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,887
After that government cheese steak

417
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,823
But maybe government cheese has most

418
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
Surreal moment

419
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,663
Came on a television show where Martha Stewart

420
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Cook stuff with snow

421
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
Can you stop

422
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:53,343
Suburban girl wears a knife

423
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,951
That's government government cheese

424
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,255
Is became a symbol of a crappy government

425
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
It was processed

426
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
He's kind of like a

427
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
Rekha Velveeta but

428
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
Remember the raw ingredients

429
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,215
Word grade a cheddar cheese

430
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
Some of it personally certified

431
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Eyebobs

432
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,359
It was 10 times better than felt I hate

433
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,919
Okay it's got It's okay okay

434
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,991
Where would I buy my truck without Velveeta but I'll tell you

435
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,319
The government process loaf was 10 times a hundred times better

436
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
It was some of it almost tastes like natural cheddar

437
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,183
I mean it was really really good product

438
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,719
This is why there is

439
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,279
Is also a community of people who are

440
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
Still obsessed with government cheese

441
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
Internet chat boards trying to find some

442
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,215
Incomparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it

443
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,055
At one point Donnie Wahlberg of the New Kids on the Block Set

444
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Quote

445
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
There's nothing like

446
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Like it the way it is

447
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,151
Melts

448
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
For a hamburger

449
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
There is nothing

450
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Kids doing the dance

451
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,831
Is carrots doing the dance

452
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
But here is why government cheese

453
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,999
Has become a kind of parable of how government intervention in markets can have

454
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
Like Butterfly Effect

455
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
In 1976

456
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,399
Jimmy Carter got on the stage and said something

457
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,679
Seemingly innocuous

458
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
And then within 5 years

459
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,591
The government was spending

460
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Billions of dollars

461
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Filling caves with cheese

462
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
But they could not get rid of

463
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
Fast enough

464
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
Well I think there's

465
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
There's

466
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,111
2 basic lessons

467
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Andy Nabokov

468
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,415
1 is

469
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
It's really hard to balance

470
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
What you want to do

471
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
Socially or politically

472
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
With what you can get away with economically

473
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,447
The second lesson

474
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Is

475
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:50,591
You got to pay attention to the unintended consequences cuz they can come back and bite you and bite you hard

476
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Even if

477
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,175
That bite just looks like some delicious cheese

478
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
That was the unintended consequence that was fun

479
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
But

480
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
The bike came in terms of how much it cost

481
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
For that opportunity

482
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
Very very expensive

483
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,183
Indeed

484
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
After the break

485
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,023
How the government finally got out of this mess

486
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,863
And why the government may be getting back into the cheesecake

487
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:17,983

498
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,255
The government cheese caves started to empty out

499
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
The guaranteed milk price

500
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
I've been going up automatically every 6 months

501
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,143
Was eventually Frozen

502
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
But that does not mean the government

503
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
Add fix the problem

504
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:55,359
The thing about price controls is that once you start them they are really really hard to unwind

505
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,711
So we have a few of the cement Surplus and now you have the political

506
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
Problem how do we

507
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,039
How do we get this cat out of the

508
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,087
The government asked economist

509
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Including Andy novakovic

510
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
Figure out how it

511
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,439
Could get out of the cheese buying busy

512
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,231
Without devastating

513
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,023
The farmers they were trying to help in the first

514
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,583
This is a basic supply and demand

515
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,679
The government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk

516
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
And so farmers worst

517
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
Supplying an unnatural amount of

518
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,311
One part of the solution then was to

519
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,359
Jet Li get that milk supply.

520
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,407
To persuade Farmers to produce

521
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,735
Plus we literally paid them money to stop producing milk

522
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
That did some good

523
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:38,367
And then on the other side the Government tried to replace some of their artificial demand

524
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
Foremilk with new

525
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Real demand for

526
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Like

527
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Hey

528
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
People of America

529
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,815
Wouldn't you like to drink more milk

530
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
We took

531
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,655
A small amount of money from every Dairy Farmer

532
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,959
Collected on every pound of milk they sold

533
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
And we created the national Dairy

534
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,615
But this is what gave us you know the got milk in the milk mustache and all those

535
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,175
Slider biconic programs that we remember

536
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
That is right

537
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:07,807
Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in 1976

538
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,343
Not only gave us government

539
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
Cheese

540
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,135
But also

541
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
Knock knock

542
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
With a few other programs and

543
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,999
And sometimes things eventually got under

544
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,095
And the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent

545
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
Suspension

546
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:21,631
These days

547
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
If the government wants to help farmers

548
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,519
What you'll generally hear about our direct subsidies as opposed to

549
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
Buying cheese

550
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,079
Yes but the government has

551
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
Tended to stay away

552
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:33,919
From buying cheese as solution

553
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
That is until

554
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Last month

555
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
The White House

556
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,599
Who's coming to the aid of farmers hurt by its own Hardline trade policies

557
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:46,207
The Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated 12 billion dollars

558
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,535
Government assistance available the Trump Administration announced

559
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:53,119
In order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs

560
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,935
The government may be making some food purchase

561
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:59,263
Just this week we finally learned some of the details

562
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:03,103
There is currently about 85 million dollars earmarked

563
