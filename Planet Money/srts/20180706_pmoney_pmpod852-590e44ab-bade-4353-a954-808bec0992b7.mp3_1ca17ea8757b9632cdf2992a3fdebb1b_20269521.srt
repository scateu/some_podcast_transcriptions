00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,888
There is a joke they tell in China about President Donald Trump's upset victory in 26

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,704

Nothing is more Global than

107
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,512
Mr.lee started making flags for countries all around the world

Mr. Lee's Factory and the inexpensive labor in his country met his business quickly became competitive on a global

112
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151

Peru flag thinking about a dime of profit on each one

114
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
A business has been going pretty consistently

115
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
With the world and with the US

116
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367

Yet

120
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
The President Trump's escalating trade tensions

121
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
Is with trying to do worry mister

122
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,935
And those tensions are especially notable to

123
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
Considering one of the orders that he is currently

124
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
We also make

125
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383

127
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455

129
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,039
Chinese in that ride

130
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
That's right

131
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
Do the flag say made in China on them

132
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Yes Auto

133
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:24,095
So Cardiff as you know a lot has been made of trump make America great again hats be made in China

134
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,471
But the fact is even though Trump has kicked off what is shaping up to be a full-on trade war with

135
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
Chinese flag

136

And

139
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
If you need thousands of flags and hats and t-shirts

140
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
Span of time at a reasonable price

141
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
You go to China

142
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
Does it feel

143
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
Strange to be making flags for

144
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,695
For him

145
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999

146
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655

It's a BMW X5

150
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
Nice car

151
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,223
And the wife said that it is from Germany

152
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,551

00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,159
Branch of BMW based in America

155
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
And in fact

They do make BMWs in Spartanburg County south

157
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023

00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
BMW move part of its production

In the 1990s and Factory employs about 9,000 workers and they had been planning a big expansion

160
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471

189
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,359
In part because of the very system

190
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
The President Trump is now condemning

191
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
And Mister Lee's flag

192
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:50,015
Might eventually end up on a US tariff

193
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
Are you worried about the trade War

194
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,903
For money

195
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
We are not so

196
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Worried because

197
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,303
First of all we have a price advantage

198
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
Overall compatibility

199
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,679
Our clients are very smart they would always go to the cheapest place

200
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
If China's cheap Legos

201
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
China of America

202
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,847
Is there actually are a lot of American flags made in the US

203
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,943
But if you see them at political rallies you should know that they are the expensive

204
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
American flag

205
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,551
And we did some searching around we looked at wholesale price

206
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
And in some cases

207
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
American flags made in the US

208
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
Or three or four

209
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,743
Or five times more expensive than the flag

210
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
In China

211
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,071
Right and this is the thing about

212
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,191
Because a u.s. made American flag she's going to be way more expensive than a flag made in

213
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
In fact

214
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
You see this across the whole Tech

215
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,359
Textile industry there used to be a big textile industry in the US up until the 90s

216
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,663
But a lot of that production is moved overseas

217
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
Stasia and that has allowed the US economy to grow

218
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
How It's Made way for a

219
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,831
A booming Tech sector and a growing healthcare industry

220
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,879
But it is also left some people behind

221
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
Mist releases

222
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
Even if his us business this

223
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
Disappears entirely

224
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
He'll be fine

225
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
Most of his business is with other countries

226
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
Lots of orders lately

227
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
In particular from Israel

228
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
Pakistan Saudi Arabia

229
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:15,007
And mostly mr.lee says it would just mean that he wouldn't be making any more us

230
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Us consumers

231
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
It would mean either

232
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,919
Pure Flags or more expensive flags at political rallies

233
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,943
Anna 4th of July

234
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:28,831
I mean you have to look at flags all the time how do you think it compares the other flags looks-wise

235
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:37,279
Replete with stars and stripes 50 stars isn't it

236
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
51 or 50

237
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,447
50

238
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847

Daniel Kurtz Laban

250
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,031
So let me ask you a

251
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
What was your first summer

252
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
Oh that's

253
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Babysitting

254
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Start babysitting when I was about 10 years old

255
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,943
I take it very serious

256
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,039
I have like a whole network of people I was like a little baby sitting

257
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Since you're a one-woman babysitter

258
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,927
Google after while because

259
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
I

260
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,303
It was like this very overachieving babysitter known for being in high demand

261
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,327
What are you here for

262
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,679
You know I thought you'd never ask my first my first real summer job with w

263
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,287
Tutus and all that was busing tables at a rat at a restaurant and Golf Course

264
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
It was called the barn

265
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,407
I was 14 The Barn is a refurbished Barn actually so is

266
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
It's not just a clever name it is in rural Iowa

267
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
But

268
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,783
I knew I was going to be doing a story this way

269
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Tweet about Teen son

270
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,575
I'm so

271
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,647
How can you blast from the past I called up the barn

272
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,511
Cuz it's still operating today to see if I could talk to one of the teenagers working there now

273
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
And

274
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
They told me there aren't any

275
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Really there yet

276
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,143
I called them

277
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Current owner of China

278
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
Mark for all I asked him

279
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
You don't get a lot of applications from teenagers anymore

280
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,591
Not really

281
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
Get some butt

282
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,455
The girls are busy they can never work when we want them

283
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:38,111
Write like there

284
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
It isn't just less of a norm

285
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,951
For now for for teenagers

286
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,719
To work then it used

287
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
To be like back when I was a teenager you were too

288
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
I think so

289
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,911
Yep course is big difference between

290
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
My time in your time to

291
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,055
I mean like Mark Ruffalo he's great I mean

292
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:01,919
Fair enough Marquis is a little older than me but I'm just bummed me out

293
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,735
Like I was saying everyone works there that said

294
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:11,391
Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised because what's happening at the barn as it turns out is emblematic of a bigger ship in the labor market

295
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,463
There's just been the shift over the last few decades away free

296
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
From the summer job

297
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
The number of teens who go out and get summer jobs

298
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
Has plummeted in the last

299
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,351
On top of that

300
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,655
Hasn't really picked up all that much since the Great

301
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Recession

302
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,751
Even though unemployment on whole is as low as it's been since 2

303
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
Let's start off with a quick

304
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
Chart on the radio

305
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
If you were to look at a chart of the

306
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,455
Employment rate for teenagers now this is 16 to 19 year olds

307
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
There are these regular Sharp

308
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Spike's upper

309
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Now that spike is July

310
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
That's the month with teen employment

311
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Peaks every year

312
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,231
And last July nearly 37% of teenagers were working

313
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,559
That's not much at least not if you compare it

314
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
The past decade

315
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,887
Back in the 1980s and 1970s

316
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,471
There were a few Summers where that teen employment rate was near Six

317
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
80%

318
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
Scooby and even the size of those

319
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
July spikes

320
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
Has gotten

321
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
The summer employment bump has shrunk

322
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,943
Considerably over the last

323
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,527
That is a big change since Paul Harrington

324
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
Had his first

325
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
So quick question what was your first

326
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
What did you do with

327
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,487
Well I thought I was out of the gas station attendant

328
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,791
I think I was about 14 then

329
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,095
Today Paul is a labor economist

330
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Drexel univ

331
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,423
Diversity and he is in a lot of research into youth

332
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,543
Absolute Market is really quite good for college grads for pretty much everyone

333
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
These are really good

334
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Good Times

335
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
Yeah the big exception of that is

336
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,735
Teenagers that teens are not doing very well there is summer job outlook

337
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,759
Is not very good

338
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
And there are a lot of reasons

339
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Paul Walker Smith

340
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Through some of them

341
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
The first big reason Young Americans aren't working is

342
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
Probably the most

343
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
Important thing is

344
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,863
Is the change of behavior in the size and behavior of older worker population

345
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,447
Lots and lots of older workers now are working in

346
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Teen labor

347
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
Americans are staying in the labor force longer and longer these

348
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
For a bunch of

349
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,407
Living longer up some people need more money to retire others just

350
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Want to work longer

351
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,503
And given the choice between a 16 year old and a 6

352
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
A six-year-old

353
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
Pulses

354
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
Most employers will pick the ladder

355
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,671
When you look at the demand side of things is very clear is that Supply able to work

356
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,695
Chris becomes available

357
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
What is clearly

358
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
Picture of them cuz employers really see all the workers

359
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
Is having the base kind of Behavioral traits

360
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,447
Either they need and they think the kids you know increasing we don't have those traits

361
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
Dependability reliability self control

362
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
In fact pulses tianjin

363
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
Tend to be in the back

364
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
The job line

365
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,895
Right now the teen unemployment rate

366
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
12.8

367
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
That is way higher than

368
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Climate rate

369
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
3.8

370
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,599
Right but it's not historically high and that's an important

371
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,415
This isn't all about employers not wanting to him

372
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Employ teens it's also about

373
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
Teams not wanting

374
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
To be employed

375
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
I knew it

376
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,095
Was there a felony or somewhere

377
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
Just get somebody angry

378
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
So many angry bat

379
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
I want the teenagers isn't it like a p

380
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
Painfully awkward

381
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,639
4 time it was we feeling

382
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
But nobody

383
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:19,295
China area but Spirit of life being stressful for teenagers like many have an incentive

384
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
Not work there's a

385
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
Reason they're not working

386
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
Every summer

387
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,951
Higher education system now I would argue punches

388
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,351
High school kids for working because of the rewards in high school for College admission her and not work related there

389
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,679
Your community service that sort of thing and yuan with respect to X

390
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
Free activities

391
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,311
Short version to lot of teenagers waiting tables just is not going to look as good on a college

392
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,151
Application essay tutoring kids are playing three sports or

393
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,455
Doing summer academic programs or burning Rush

394
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,527
And there's sort of a broader cultural aspect

395
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
Because

396
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Becomes less of a

397
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Thing

398
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,159
For teens to work for teens even can

399
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Sitter work

400
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,487
Just not the normal kind of like Mark and I were talking

401
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
Also we should do

402
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,559
Just add this phenomenon doesn't

403
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Call Tina

404
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,679
In fact the team job market is yet another area in which life is

405
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
A little bit easier if you have

406
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
A little more money

407
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,799
Lower the family income less likely to get it to work

408
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:17,663
In a family income Rises you know much higher probability for the for the child to work

409
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
A lot of cats

410
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:20,223
To do with how the liver Mark at work

411
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,295
The waking John adults get jobs is through

412
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
Flea markets of social network

413
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
The social system

414
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
I can't believe you need

415
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,975
Contacts now for a summer job tell about who you know kid

416
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
You don't you got to learn that early

417
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
But

418
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,863
One thing I should adhere is that the cause and effect kind of go both ways

419
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,399
Is here because aside from what Paul was

420
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:44,287
You know rich kids might just be more likely to live in healthier economies where there are more jobs anyway

421
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Likewise Lawrence

422
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
Some kids might live in an area with fewer

423
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
So that also

424
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:55,039
DePaul the decline and teens working is really bad news because team jobs are important and giving

425
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
Basic foundational works

426
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,647
It's a way you develop proficiency

427
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
How do you learn behavioral traits

428
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,999
One of the ways to do it is you go behave

429
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
The first time

430
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,863
That you're a stack for almost everybody

431
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
It's the first time you're asked to act as an adult

432
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,191
In adults

433
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Weather adultery precautions

434
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
For your decision

435
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Either positive or negative

436
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,407
Impulse is delaying that economy-wide millions of kids

437
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Is going to create

438
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
Workforce wide protective

439
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
That's what you worried about

440
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
But

441
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,391
For people like Paul who really worried about this I'm happy to report that all is not lost

442
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:37,279
I found a teen summer worker. Of course they still exist so I called up the

443
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,399
Swimming pool in Buffalo Center Iowa I figured if my old workplace.

444
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
Seeds around at least one of my

445
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
Friends

446
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,751
Add I got to talk

447
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,775
Crystal shutter

448
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:51,871
She's 18 years old she just graduated from North Iowa high school gobison

449
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,943
And this is her second summer lifeguarding at the buffalo

450
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
It's much more fun than I

451
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,039
Originally anticipated

452
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:04,927
I mean I work with great people and I enjoy the kids and they're goofy comments then

453
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
All of that stuff

454
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
Yeah I mean

455
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,791
What do you

456
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
Is that what you like most about it is

457
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
With the kids

458
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
Yeah

459
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,727
Truth be told I eat

460
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:22,335
Did not like kids growing up like they just kind of scared me

461
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,479
Crystal was great I mean she she actually took her time out of her day of lifeguarding she was talking to me from the Buffalo Center

462
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Cool office

463
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,599
And she got over her phobia of kids of course how she's lifeguarding

464
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
But you never plan on making a career of this

465
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
Of course she's headed to college

466
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
Yeah I'm going to go to Iowa State

467
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,279
And major in animal science

468
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,839
Cool are you going to be a veterinarian

469
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
I that's that's the goal

470
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:50,239
Pictures of thing working at the pool Chris is not getting experience with dogs or

471
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
Like that that actually doesn't

472
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,639
She is that could you work while in high school

473
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,943
They just have more likely to work as an adult

474
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
Getty up higher

475
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
Employment rates

476
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,551
As adults and kids who don't work while in high school

477
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,879
Second thing is is that as adults 10 years later

478
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:11,231
To make somewhere between 10 and 20% more holding other factors constant

479
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
10 kids who didn't work

480
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:18,399
So Chris's job now will make her higher earnings this a better worker down the line policy

481
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
And even at age 8

482
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
Team Krista says she can see this happening

483
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
And herself

484
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
Do you feel like this is

485
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,335
Good job experience or prep

486
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,615
The real world

487
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,175
Absolutely I mean

488
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
Constantly interact

489
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
Parents and kids and I think it's really help

490
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
My

491
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575

All of those

495
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,303
Skills you develop babysitting they've made you the reporter that you are now

496
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:52,959

Sellit Garcia

501

Better-looking

502
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,791
Definitely so much better looking possibly even earlier

503
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
With more lame jokes

504
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,375
Jason lame I meant awesome

505
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,703
Awesome joke last week we went to a bar to watch the world

506
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Stop and repeat

507
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
Economic insights that came out of it

And we also got inside of what it looks like to do a big bank stress test

509
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:34,687
