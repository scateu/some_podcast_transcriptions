00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,024
Warning

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,608
Today Show has racial slurs and sexually explicit

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,376
Midterms

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,680
Simonton grub in San Diego

5
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:11,008
He was Chinese American and some have that made it tough

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,544
It was when I was in Middle School

7
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,104
And I had to stay behind cuz I was cleaning up

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,384
The sports equipment

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,664
Next thing you know I was

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
Pushed to the ground

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,480
And they were kicking me

12
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:24,832
I'm punching me over and over again throwing sand in my face they kept yelling at me

13
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
Kept saying

14
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,416
Japna capsuling gook

15
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,768
At one point I finally just snapped and I said you know what I'm a chink

16
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,328
I can be going to be racist at least do it correctly

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,864
That moment

18
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,656
As always stuck with him

19
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,472
He grew up move to Oregon and he started a band

20
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,032
When he was trying to figure out what to name the band

21
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,336
Do you want to find something that sounded like a band

22
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,640
But it also said something about being Asian

23
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,176
Something that asserted his ID

24
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,736
So that's my friends around Portland

25
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,040
What's something you think

26
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,576
All Asians have in common

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,160
They would immediately say slanted eyes

28
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:04,512
I found fascinating because I thought well you know it's not true

29
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
So he decides

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,584
Disease that stereotype

31
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
Own it

32
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,424
And turn it into something completely different

33
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,496
He ends up naming his van

34
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,104
Display the band starts playing gigs around Portland

35
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
Play songs like this

36
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,904
They weren't just musicians who happen to be Asian they were

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304
Super into being Asian they raise money for families in North Korea

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
Racism Workshop

39
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
Anime convention

40
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,144
Things are going great

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,936
The band started touring more

42
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,728
But then Simon discovered

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,800
They were other bands that were also calling themselves

44
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
Office lamps

45
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
I was in Tucson Arizona

46
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,688
For some fans of art bought tickets to see

47
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
I thought it was us

48
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,808
It was a local band also call this late

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,952
So in 2010 Simon did what artists and for that matter companies do when there is confusion over there now

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,024
He applied to register a trademark with the Federal

51
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
So that he could have some control over who could use the name

52
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
The Slants

53
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,168
A few months later he got a call from his lawyer

54
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,752
SSA Simon we got a problem with your application

55
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,360
Sammy. Maybe I submitted the wrong paperwork or something so no all that's fine

56
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
But he said

57
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,480
The Trademark Office rejected your application because it said

58
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
It's

59
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,088
Disparaging two persons of Asian descent

60
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
And I remember I took a moment to

61
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Think about

62
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
The term disparaging

63
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
What does it mean what I think it means

64
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
And then I'm like

65
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,144
Wait a second are they single racist to Asian people

66
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Annie sez

67
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704

68
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I melt the chain

70
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,920
There is a government agent

71
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
I have to make lots of decisions about

72
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
Hate speech

73
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,296
Racial slurs homophobic put-downs and sex

74
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
Simon Tam got into a fight

75
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
Is agency a fight about free speech

76
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
And it went all the way to the Supreme Court

77
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
Put the kids to bed

78
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536

When Simon filed a trademark

91
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Location in 20

92
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
And it went to Alexandria Virginia

93
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Home of the US patent

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
And trademark office

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,176
Land looking government building and you're in a

96
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
Small office with a window that doesn't open

97
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
Rebecca Gunn is a trademark lawyer

98
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Current used to work in that

99
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
She didn't handle Simon's applique

100
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
But you handled the thousands

101
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
It was her job to decide whether to approve those out

102
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,559
You had to follow a federal law that lets the government reject

103
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,607
Trademarks that quote images

104
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Barrage

105
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,935
There is government speech Happening Here

106
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
And I think it is

107
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,031
A compelling government interest

108
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,127
That the government is not speaking in a way

109
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
That

110
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
Makes people think the government is okay

111
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,295
With the content of what is being expressed

112
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
In other words when the federal government

113
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,879
Agrees to register at

114
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
It is putting a stamp on an a

115
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:51,583
Like almost literally you know when you see that that little capital r with a circle around it next to a product

116
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
That is the government thing

117
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:59,007
Yes we agree to register this trademark and we're using the power of federal law.

118
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,823
So the question Rebecca had to answer was

119
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,383
When does the government give its

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Stamp of approval

121
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
And when was something just too offensive

122
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
And she didn't have much time to make

123
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
You're roughly given an hour

124
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,391
To examine a file and sometimes some files will take more

125
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
And sometimes some files will take glass

126
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,559
An hour that's like zero time you're talking about a government program

127
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
That has thousands of applications

128
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,631
Is here

129
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,935
And people on the outside

130
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
Are very cranky

131
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
When their applications do not get processed

132
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
As quickly as possible

133
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:38,431
I have to speak with the lawyer at the Trademark Office who made the call in Simon's case

134
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
To look at his application and said

135
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,759
The Slants

136
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,551
We're not going to give that are

137
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,831
Stamp of approval

138
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,159
But the Trademark Office declined my request for an interview

139
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
So I ask someone else to walk me through the reject

140
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,511
I'm Ron Coleman

00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535

The Slants

147
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,335
The Slants I said it and I'm very comfortable saying it

148
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,175
Watch me through that rejection letter from the trademark office

149
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,015

It was just one of those

00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,175
Fighting with a trademark

177
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:20,063
He makes a case for how he's using Slants in a way that celebrates Asian-American identity

178
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,439
Include statements from leaders of Asian American organizations and news stories about the band's activism

179
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,255
But the trademark of his just keeps saying no just keeps

180
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,279
Denying his

181
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,911
At one point they sent him a photocopy page from a 20 year old book called forbidden American

182
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447

183

They just called Asian people orientals in the Forbidden English book

186
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
Well that's a very nice point that you make

187
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:53,599
But in 1995 I think that's what we were still saying maybe we were

188
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
But he were

189
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Alright Elsa

190
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,231
I want to say at this point in the show

191
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,535
Ridiculous

192
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,071
But it's not just

193
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,935
The whatever some random twenty-year-old book it's not just Urban Dictionary I brought in

194
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
The paper dictionary that we have in the office

195
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
It's the New Oxford American dictionary

196
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,335
Okay I'm going to open it to slam

197
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,455
Slang

198
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Swimsuits

199
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,063
One of the definitions

200
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
Says

201
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Slant

202
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
Derogatory

203
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,487
Contemptuous term for an East Asian or Southeast Asian

204
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
This is Judo

205
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,095
About a story that is saying slant is derogatory

206
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
If this is in the dictionary like

207
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:39,935
Why

208
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,799
Why are the lawyers at the Trademark Office citing some random old bukit sighting Urban DIC

209
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
That's the way the law works

210
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,919
The trademark office is supposed to reject an application

211
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,271
If it uses a term that is disparaging to what's called a

212
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
Stantial

213
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Composite

214
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,367
Of some group of people so in this case

215
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
A substantial composite

216
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
A vision

217
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
People of Asian descent

218
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
So the trademark office lawyer

219
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,327
Is fighting all these different sources to

220
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,399
Try to show this idea that Slants

221
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Is derogatory

222
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:18,335
Into widespread amount of people that get it out there it's out there in lots of different place yet feeling that it's derogatory

223
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
Rebecca gone the lawyer who used

224
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
To work at the trademark office

225
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
She told me about this one case

226
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
That really illustrates

227
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
The case was over

228
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,087
The word

229
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Keep

230
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
He'd people the flu against Jewish people like

231
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,023
Exactly and it's also the name of a magazine by and for Jews

232
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
And when Rebecca was working at the trademark office

233
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,631
He applied for a trademark registration

234
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,703
I had a subscription to heat magazine right so I was not offended

235
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
Clearly because I had a subscription

236
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:52,639
Rebecca wasn't the lawyer assigned to that case but because she's Jewish one of her colleagues asked her what she thought

237
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
I am sure

238
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,223
That grandmothers

239
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
And

240
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
Other folks in the community

241
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Probably did

242
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,111
Does it feel the heat

243
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
It's probably

244
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,695
Offensive because they grew up with stories of

245
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
Their grandparents

246
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
Getting beaten up

247
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
And

248
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
Having that

249
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
Insults hurled at the

250
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,655
So she said even though I subscribe to this magazine

251
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
I don't think we should give the name he

252
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,263
The federal government stamp of approval

253
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
She told her colleagues

254
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
We should deny the application and

255
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
What happened

256
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:24,895
This is

257
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
Clearly not

258
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,247
Science right doesn't like well let's think about it

259
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Colleagues

260
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
And this the system can lead to

261
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,391
What's he like really inconsistent out

262
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,231
Uses in particular with trademarks that are sexually

263
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:45,119
Like for example Rebecca told me she personally rejected a trademark for the phrase meatholes

264
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
Because she thought it was too dirty

265
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,799
But they're all these other super explicit sexual terms that have been approved by the

266
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
I talked to Megan Carpenter

267
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,967
Study this and she listed off a bunch of these approved term

268
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Dirty b****

269
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,039
Drunk ass b******

270
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,855
Edible crotchless gummy panties

271
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,695
Egotistical

272
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:15,839
Where some lawyer at the government has looked at an application and said okay you got it registered

273
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Flea market hookers

274
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
Fupa pouch

275
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:19,935
Fustercluck

276
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
Mad in the USA

277
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
Okay

278
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
Make a thing a few things are going on

279
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
1 is

280
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
The process is just a pretty random process

281
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,015
It depends on what your lawyer at the trademark office gets assigned to your case but she's also saying

282
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,831
You see meaningful changes as

283
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
Societal sensibilities change

284
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
I do think we've seen an n

285
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,255
A growing acceptance of terms as

286
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
Language evolved

287
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Take picture

288
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,863
Used to be a slur for gate

289
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
People and used to get rejected a lot by the Traymore

290
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,311
Ben gay people talk talk the word back you know there was like a slogan we're here we're queer

291
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
The word

292
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,615
Stop being defensive

293
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,967
And the Trademark Office started saying yes more often to trademarks that use the word

294
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
And that is what Simon Tam wants to do

295
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,671
The same thing that gay people do with queer he wants to take the word back

296
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,487
Abraham this fight over the trademark

297
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
Bombs away to do that

298
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Eating

299
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,863
The federal government doesn't get to decide what

300
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,423
Offensive to Asian Americans

301
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,703
To decide for ourselves

302
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
Simon becomes upset

303
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
Start spending 30 40 hours a week on the case

304
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
Start cutting back his time on music

305
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Just so we can work on the key

306
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
I like I have my attorney on speed dial

307
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
He was in my

308
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,319
Of my friends and family

309
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
5 Willis like

310
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
That's how often we were talking

311
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,463
Multiple emails every single day like

312
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
Hundreds of emails between us

313
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
But by the end of 2011 it's clear to Simon that he is never going to convince the

314
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,703
The trademark office they just keep saying no

315
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,007
So Simon and his lawyers

316
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
They come up with a new plan

317
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
A new strategy

318
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,127
And this one is is much more ambitious

319
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
It's not just about the words

320
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
They decide they're going to attack

321
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
The law is

322
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Self

323
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,295
They start to argue

324
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:16,415
That rule that says the government can deny trademark registration for disparaging term

325
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
That rule itself

326
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,023
Is a violation of the First Amendment violates

327
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
Our right to free speech

328
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,863
I talked about this with Ron Coleman

329
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
Simon's lawyer

330
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
And I should just say that

331
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,239
Ron is Jewish and he's been called names

332
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,639
So I wanted to know personally how far would he go with his first amendment argument

333
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
Is there any word

334
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
You don't think should

335
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Ever betrayed me

336
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:46,367
Where we are at the society now we're constitutional law is in the year 2017

337
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,415
There can be

338
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
No

339
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Word

340
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,047
And no image that cannot be registered as a trademark

341
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
No word

342
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,351
So Kate

343
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Kikes

344
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,143
That can be registered

345
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Absolutely

346
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
What a chink

347
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Course

348
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
Wet vac

349
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
Course

350
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
If you could

351
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
Demonstrate that it is

352
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:10,943
Functioning as a trademark another words you have selling a product or offering a service in connection with it

353
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
If a driver

354
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
Ron and Simon take this first

355
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
An argument.

356
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
And they lose

357
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
But the appeal

358
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,975
And in 2015 a federal appeals court agrees with

359
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
They find that the trademark law is unconstitutional

360
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
That it does file

361
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,655
Andy Obama administration appealed bats

362
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
And the Supreme Court agreed to take the case

363
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,031
The oral argument in the case was in January

364
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
And of course Simon went to Washington DC

365
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:45,247
2 days before the plants had a little concert on the steps

366
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
The Supreme Court

367
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
And then it was the morning

368
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
Simon went into the courtroom

369
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
And her Chief Justice John Roberts

370
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
Announce

371
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,023
Your arguments first this morning in case 15 1293

372
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Lee vs. Tam

373
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,167
Simon sitting bear wearing his lucky dinosaur song

374
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,703
You thinking about

375
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,751
All the work he's done on this case

376
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,567
How it had taken over his entire life

377
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
And he realizes at that moment

378
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
It's all come down to this

379
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
I was just

380
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
I guess filled with too much emotion to even like

381
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
Think clearly for that for that

382
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,855
For the first few moments anyway I was I did

383
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Me for me

384
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Thinking

385
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:29,023
Almost a decade of my life is culminating to like this 55 minute argument

386
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
Then I have a question

387
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:35,935
At one point Justice Sotomayor seems to attack Simon's First Amendment

388
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,983
No one stopping your client

389
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,799
From calling itself the slabs

390
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
No one stopping them

391
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,663
From advertising themselves that way

392
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,527
Or signing contracts that way or engaging in any activity

393
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,087
But just go ahead

394
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,671
Call yourself to slam put on T-shirts shouted from the rooftop

395
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
The trademark office

396
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
But at another Point Justice

397
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:06,911
Haggens used to come in on the other side

398
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,727
Even in a government program even assuming that

399
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
Pictures of point

400
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,847
There's a part of First Amendment law that says the government shouldn't say

401
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
Some viewpoints are okay

402
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,687
But others are not

403
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
It's something called Viewpoint discrimination

404
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,391
I'm saying here is that maybe the government might be doing this by saying

405
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,951
Some trademarks are good While others

406
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,975
Or disparaging

407
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
You see the point

408
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
The point is that I can say good things

409
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,327
What about something

410
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,631
But I can't say bad things about something

411
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:41,727
And I would have thought that was a fairly classic case of people and discrimination

412
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
It's going back and forth

413
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
You know there

414
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
Debating these

415
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
Theoretical First Amendment implications

416
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
Assignment the key moment that morning

417
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
Went back to something that was

418
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
It was really much more

419
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,111
It went back to the reason he decided to call his band the slam

420
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,415
At one point

421
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

422
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
Speaks in the room goes silent

423
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,863
If it's not count at all

424
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,911
Everyone

425
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Nose

426
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,495
History classes using this term

427
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
But

428
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Completed

429
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,711
It was like at that moment I'd like

430
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
She gets it she knows what we're trying to do

431
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,111
And then less than an hour after the argument started

432
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
Colorful

433
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,695
Jesus submitted

434
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,791
The Supreme Court's decision in the states is expected any day

435
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
Sometime in the next

436
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
A lot of people are watching this

437
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
Really close

438
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,423
Including the Washington

439
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
The football team

440
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:49,311
A few years back the Trademark Office cancel the team's trademark registration for Redskins

441
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:53,407
The office said that's a disparaging term so now the teams rooting for Simon.

442
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
They even filed an amicus

443
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,015
That's illegal equivalent of saying we're totally

444
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Ebro

445
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,879
How do you feel about being on the same side as the Washington Redskins

446
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
I don't think I'm on the same side as the

447
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
I think the

448
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
Team name is racist

449
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
I I think it's I think

450
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,119
That Native Americans have made it

451
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
Womanly clear how they feel

452
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
About not only that team

453
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,311
But all sports in general that use human beings as mascot

454
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
What is as

455
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,943
The point of the first amendment is to protect people who don't agree with

456
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,503
That's how free switch work

457
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
As a person of color

458
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,879
Who has experienced a lot of racial discrimination in

459
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
And the target

460
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:41,023
A lot of racial slurs second I have to register trademark before I can call you a chink

461
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
They just go ahead and do it

462
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,631
Races are going to be racist whether they have a registration or not

463
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
The Slants recently released the song

464
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
Called from the heart

465
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,823
Simon calls it an open letter to the US patent and trademark office

466
