1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,560
We all have that person on face

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,864
Maybe it's a friend maybe it's a relative

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,936
Shrek I need a person

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,984
Ford's news articles that are not

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,008
Entirely

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,336
Florist I doubt she's an NPR correspondent

7
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,872
Velour that person is

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:16,896
Her aunt

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
My aunt is

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,760
Really into what's fake news she thinks it's real

11
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,880
I mean she post things like Muslim nurses refuse to wash hands before operation

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
Not true

13
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:28,928
Not true

14
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,232
More more I'm looking I'm looking here

15
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,048
Michelle Obama is a transvestite

16
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:39,936
That Obama is a secret Muslim who's possibly gay so he's a gay Muslim

17
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
Set fake fake info

18
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,496
You must have

19
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,520
When that's your aunt

20
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,544
The stuff was fake

21
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,128
I did and we got into a big fight over it

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,992
She essentially didn't believe me and said will you work for the mainstream media

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,064
But it definitely got me thinking

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
About all of this and where was it coming from and I began to go down this road to really try

25
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,488
Find understand this

26
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,280
Call phenomena of fake news

27
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,888
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Robert Smith

28
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,704
And I'm Laura Seidel today on the show

29
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
We are going to take what

30
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
Just

31
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
1

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,824
Fake news story

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,896
Optically odious one that implies that Hillary Clinton

34
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
Is a murderer

35
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,992
And we're going to follow this fake news story all the way back

36
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
Why you wrote it

37
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040
Who published it

38
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
And why

39
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
Every single word

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,136
Of this article is fake

41
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
But what is real

42
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,256
Is that it was shared over half a million times on Facebook

43
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
And that means

44
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
Somebody

45
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
Somewhere

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
Who's making Fairy real money off of

47
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,168
We find him

48
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,240
We find a fake news Mogul running a fake news Empire

49
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
Until the fallacy

Okay where are we picked

62
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
1

63
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
Fake news story

64
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Give us the head

65
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,736
FBI agent suspected in Hillary email leaks

66
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,552
Found dead in apparent murder-suicide

67
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
This article

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
Is amazed

69
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
It has a

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,792
Complicated dark plot about how one of the FBI investigators looking for the Clinton email scandal

71
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,120
Dies under mysterious circumstances their names

72
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Dates and

73
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
And locations to murder at the suicide

74
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,240
Facts don't matter because of course

75
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
It's all made up

76
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
It's all fake

77
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,312
But it looks

78
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,080
So

79
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
Professional

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
There's this

81
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
Big photo of a

82
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
Giant Fireball looks legit

83
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
And it's on a site called the Denver Guardian

84
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,784
Which looks real

85
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
Weather in local stories

86
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,624
Someone has put a lot of time in

87
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,952
So this is all I have to go on I have a pile of fake

88
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,816
Tell if there's no author there's no name on the site and I tried to find out who owns a domain name

89
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
Denverguardian.com

90
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
And I hit a wall

91
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,424
It was registered anonymously

92
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
But luckily I know this guy

93
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,568
Let's just see if we can figure this out

94
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
One second

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,480
This is John Jansen head of engineering at Master McNeil a tech company in Berkeley California

96
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,784
But in his spare time he's an internet

97
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,320
I'm

98
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:39,648
Basically responsible for reverse engineering a whole bunch of

99
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
Different websites

100
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
Something of John like an archaeologist

101
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
He's digging around in

102
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Into the foundation

103
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
Website

104
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
I set him to work

105
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,144
On this FBI murder suicide article

106
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
And he starts to look through the computer code at the site

107
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,752
Denverguardian.com

108
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
And there it is

109
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
The first

110
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
Entry used

111
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,592
Set up the website

112
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Made by someone with the handle

113
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
Let Texas

114
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,016
Which sounds a lot like somebody with some kind of political agenda

115
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,600
That was sort of the thread that started to unravel everything really

116
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
He discovers this

117
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Full

118
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,416
Network

119
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
Fake news outlets

120
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:14,720
With

121
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
Real city names

122
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,815
Nationalreport.net United media

123
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Publishing.com

124
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
Conservative

125
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:21,887
Frontline.

126
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
International report

127
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Dot net

128
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,239
All filled with fake news

129
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
So our detective John Jansen checks the IP address

130
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
All these websites

131
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,639
Share the same server

132
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
So Janssen Dixon more

133
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
He finds an old email address

134
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
Cross checks

135
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
Define the name

136
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,647
There's an individual whose name is jestin Coler

137
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
Who appears to be behind a bunch of the stuff

138
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Justin

139
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
Kohler

140
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
Which cannot be a real

141
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
I mean the word jest

142
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,887
Is in there Justin

143
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Kohler

144
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
And yet

145
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
This guy has a LinkedIn

146
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
It says he wants old magazine subscriptions work

147
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
Is a database administrator

148
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
And a freelance writer

149
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
Ha

150
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,407
Writer

151
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
The next thing is that he's a

152
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
Contributing freelance writer

153
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,063
International yachtsman magazine

154
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
Don't blame anyone for cycling that's okay

155
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:21,535
So Hillary is being tormented by a secret cabal of international yachtsman

156
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
Or ceiling journalist

157
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,911
And you know it's tempting to think that there's probably some poor writer who

158
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
Couldn't tell the article about sailing

159
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,751
And decided to start making stuff

160
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
But then we discover

161
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
The business

162
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
Jestin Coler

163
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,151
Has started a company called Epic

164
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Disinfo media

165
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,247
It's so obvious

166
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
I mean like calling yourself

167
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
Evil Corp

168
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
I know but even something called disinfo media

169
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,487
How to write down an address when the Incorporated and that really dress

170
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
Is in a suburb of Los Angeles California

171
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
Near the ocean

172
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Where

173
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
There are yachts

174
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,447
This whole thing is coming together

175
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
It's a beautiful sunny afternoon in Los Angeles I grabbed the fake article

176
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
And I take my producer Luke vanderploeg and we go

177
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,647
We have it's listed as the office of disinfo media

178
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:26,047
There in a triple one of these typical LA strip malls

179
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:32,447
Sushi and nail spa and then we drive up to the exact address that we have

180
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:38,847
What this appears to be a normal hold a post office box

181
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:44,735
16450 of course it is if you're fake news guy you probably would fake address

182
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
I was bummed

183
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,927
But I did have second address and the second address was right around the corner

184
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,559
Minivan all right so he's got a minivan to one-story home kind of a

185
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
Bungalow home

186
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,447
And it's palm tree in the front lawn because hey this is Southern California

187
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
American flag

188
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
So I may be a patriot

189
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
So we're going to give it a shot now

190
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
So we get out of the car

191
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,223
I am a little nervous cuz it's clearly somebody's home

192
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
Hi there

193
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
Looking for Justin Koehler

194
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
When is asking something

195
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
Had a

196
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Story that I'm wondering if you wrote

197
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
You damn right it

198
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:38,239
I'm at just so you know I'm a reporter with NPR and

199
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
We were looking online and

200
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,455
You're a lot of tracing discovered the disinformation media

201
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
Was the

202
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
Owner of several websites that you know such as the national report.

203
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Butler that was totally

204
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
Oh I'm sure it was him

205
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:13,311
We actually even check the mailman happen to be going by and we said does Justin Koehler live there and he confirmed he does

206
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
So we were sure it was him

207
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
He just didn't want to talk to you

208
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
But we did leave a mark on tag

209
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
And we went back to the office

210
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
And

211
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
Maybe an hour and a half later

212
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,623
We got an email from Justin Cole

213
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
He said he would

214
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,743
My name is Justin Koehler am the owner of disinfo media Inc

215
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
You found it Laura you found a guy

216
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
I did and he was not

217
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,399
Quite what I was expecting here is his kind of

218
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,983
Average looking 40 year old guy with a wife and two kids

219
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,055
And a really beautiful comfortable home

220
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
You had for yachting magazine

221
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
I did write for yachting magazine

222
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
You like jazz

223
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,551
I don't care for Yachts no but they hired me as a travel writer in

224
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
Today was good so

225
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,671
That was part of his real news career the fake part didn't start until

226
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
2013

227
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
And that's the part we really wanted to know about

228
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
Why did he write fake news

229
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
And how did he get away with it

230
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Justin says

231
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,655
He was always interested

232
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
In the art

233
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
A propaganda

234
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,263
You know what would people believe how do you explain that

235
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
And he says he started

236
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
Disinfo media

237
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,615
At first just for fun

238
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
Just a test out his ideas

239
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,687
And you also says

240
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,223
He is not a conservative

241
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,295
If he did not do this to bring down Hillary Clinton in fact

242
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
This really surprised me

243
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
He says he's a liberal

244
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
And then he started doing this

245
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,719
Fake news business

246
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
Basically to provoke

247
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
The alt right

248
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
He's like a reverse troll

249
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,143
Can the whole idea from the start was the kind of build

250
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,751
Aside the good kind of infiltrate the echo chambers of the all right

251
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:51,103
Published blatantly false or fictional stories and then

252
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:56,735
I got to be able to publicly denounce those stories and end point out the fact that they were

253
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
Queer fiction

254
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
Dessert made my head hurt

255
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
@justin claimed

256
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Did he wrote

257
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,159
Fake news stories about Democrat

258
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,487
So that conservatives would spread them around

259
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,559
And then look stupid when the stories were discovered is fake

260
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
I know

261
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,423
I know it sounds a bit odd and we checked what we could about him

262
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,263
Justin Koehler is his real name and he actually is a registered Democrat

263
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
And I do have to say

264
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,383
When he talks about the specific fake news story

265
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
He's written

266
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
You can hear the Glee he has

267
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,759
In basically screwing with everyone

268
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,415
One of my personal favorites was the story that I wrote about a pot shop marijuana shop in Colorado

269
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,303
Justin wrote a news story about how customers in Colorado marijuana shops for using food stamps to buy pot

270
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
And it sounds ridiculous of course

271
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,423
Buddy got picked up in a spread like crazy years Fox News

272
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,775
I can people collecting food stamps in Colorado

273
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
Add marijuana to the shopping list

274
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
Right now the answer is

275
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,639
Yes

276
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,735
I'm so that when I got a decent chuckle out of myself I thought that was a good time

277
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,319
He doesn't sound like a prankster I mean he clearly Delights

278
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
And getting a ride

279
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:11,231
So yeah I went and I I looked at some of his side to use when it's called National reports

280
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,839
And headlines are kind of more trying to be like the onion for conservatives like

281
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,863
Take this one

282
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Bernie Sanders

283
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,423
Conter for debate

284
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
Look at his poll numbers now

285
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,311
And Jesse says at least in the beginning he was an equal-opportunity pranks

286
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,383
He tried to Peddle fake news for lefties he says

287
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
Making a vial things about

288
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Conservatives

289
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:37,343
It just has never worked and never takes off if people will always set you know you'll get debunk like within the first two comments

290
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,903
And another thing is kind of Fizzles out

291
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,511
I'm just going to stop occasionally hear the podcast to say that Justin is an admitted liar

292
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,327
And despite saying you dinner for fun at some point

293
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Fake news

294
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,887
Clearly became a money maker

295
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:55,519
Progestin you get people to share a fake news article you can sell all these eyeballs to advertisers

296
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
And his fake news sites

297
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
Do you have real a

298
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
Justin would not

299
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,455
Give us the exact amount of money he's making up a fake news

300
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,271
But he eventually admitted that he made in the ballpark of

301
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
10 to $30,000 and

302
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,439
You are making good money at it so it also gave you a lot of incentive to keep

303
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Doing it

304
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
Regardless of

305
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
The empire

306
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Correct

307
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,191
He was a fake news businessman and he figured out the best way to deliver his product

308
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Step one

309
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
Make it look real

310
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,823
He bought domain names like Washington Post

311
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Dot-com

312
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Doc Co

313
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,919
And usatoday.com

314
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,527
Somewhere so fake that they sounded real like the Denver Garden

315
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
You know, the idea was to

316
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,951
Make this ice look as is legit as possible right to the homepage of course they're going to be

317
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,815
Local news local forecast local sports

318
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:55,423
The actual fake news stories were going to be buried off the homepage so

319
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,775
You know if you were reading a story and then you click to the homepage of that car this looks like

320
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Denver guardian or

321
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,615
Any number of sites

322
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,943
Justin could actually keep up with the demand so Step 2

323
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
You've had a lot of former writers

324
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,039
Just like himself willing right fake news

325
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,343
It's probably 20 to 25 contributors

326
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,903
Step 3 to profiting off of

327
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Fake news

328
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,975
The arrival of Donald J Trump

329
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
I mean my gosh the number of just fake

330
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
Accounts

331
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,375
On Facebook exploded during the Trump election

332
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:31,263
And this brings us to the article we have been tracking this whole time the one about the FBI agent

333
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,871
Who is killed after his alleged involvement in leaking Clinton emails

334
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
Justin did not

335
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,063
Doesn't know the real name of the contributor who did but he did publish it and he says he got 1.6 million views over

336
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
10 days

337
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,951
Another the people wanted to hear this you know so all it took was to write that story

338
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:55,071
Everything about it was fictional the town the people that sheriff the FBI got

339
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
And then you know

340
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,983
How does our social media guys going to go out and do a little

341
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
Dropping it throughout

342
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Trump groups in Trump forums in

343
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
Spread like wildfire

344
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,223
The story was quickly debunked on sites like snopes.com and

345
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,783
The real paper in Denver The Denver Post

346
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,319
What's a lot of trump supporters

347
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
This did not matter

348
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:23,743
They don't care that it was debunked you know snopes is Run by George Soros and Israel Obama mouthpiece to them and

349
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,839
You know the credibility of these kind of sources I guess it's been

350
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,631
Just tarnish so much that

351
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
Nobody even listens anymore

352
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,215
In case you didn't quite get that Snopes

353
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,775
.com is a sort of fact-checking websites

354
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,335
It is not actually owned by George Soros

355
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,895
Will you in some ways Justin

356
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Did prove his point

357
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:48,319
You can prank people pretty easily you can make money off of it you can degrade the truth you can make everything worthless you can do all

358
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
All of these things

359
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
The thing is

360
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:56,255
Identifying serious business because Hillary Clinton did lose the election and some people think fake news was Atkins

361
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Forgetting Factor today

362
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,071
So I asked him

363
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,423
Do you have somebody who identifies as liberal have any regrets

364
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,007
To the extent to which fake news went viral during the presidential

365
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
I don't

366
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
There are

367
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,151
Many factors as to why Trump won

368
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
That don't involve fake

369
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
Snooze right

370
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,735
Enough

371
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,063
As much as I like Hillary she was a poor candidate

372
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
She

373
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
Brought in a lot of baggage

374
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
So I don't I don't find myself

375
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,487
I don't I'm not guilty of that I'm not going to

376
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
I'm not going to live with that on my conscience

377
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
So you don't feel response

378
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
I do not

379
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,983
Since the election there's been a lot of hand-wringing and news organizations including ours about

380
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,031
How to stop people like Justin

381
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,591
How to stop the stuff from being spread around

382
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:48,479
At least some way to label it and Target news is fake before everyone reads it before everyone believes it

383
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,039
But if you're just so you know I cannot

384
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
Imagine

385
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
The dad is going to work

386
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,671
Like there is a demand for this product

387
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
People want

388
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,511
Conspiracy like people want fake news

389
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
It confirms what they already believe

390
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:06,655
And we know from history what happens when you try to Outlaw product that everyone wants

391
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,983
Justin told me one of his sights

392
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,799
Nationalreport.net was actually blocked

393
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,359
On Facebook and it lost its ad contract

394
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Google

395
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,199
But he said from his perspective that doesn't even matter

396
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:22,015
There are literally hundreds of AD Networks

397
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Literally hundreds of them

398
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,391
Early last week I just my inbox was just

399
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,999
Filled every day with people because they knew that Facebook was her Google excuse me was cracking down

400
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,559
Hundreds of people wanting to work

401
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,839
With my sights

402
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
You know that right

403
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,679
It occurs to me that there has never been a better time

404
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,775
To be in the fake news business I mean after all this election showed

405
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,847
Did their hundreds of thousands of people who view these articles

406
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
And that the articles

407
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Work

408
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,223
Your projections perspective there is money to be made

409
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
And yet

410
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
Justin may turn all of this down

411
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
He's been talking with his wife

412
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,927
And he says he is thinking about getting out of the fake news business

413
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
Now this is something I

414
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Head enjoy doing

415
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Butter

416
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,631
How that kind of joy is gone I guess

417
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,447
Donovan just keep getting

418
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,775
Deeper into distress at iron going to stay away from this sort of stuff

419
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:21,407
So he might just be telling us what we want to hear it and it maybe I'm just go about but I have a feeling

420
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,455
He ended up in over his head

421
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,463
We're always interested in dark corners of the internet that we don't know about so if you see any other wrongdoing

422
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:38,815
