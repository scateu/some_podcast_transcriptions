Tips and information about investing

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
Before you invest

Investor.gov

10
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
Ron Flores

11
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
Is overseas surveillance

12
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,040
At the Pechanga Casino in Southern California

13
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:28,416
And if that like calls a picture to your mind what the sky looks like slick back hair suit earpiece

14
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,208
Ron is not that guy

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,024
He's got a long black ponytail

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048
Jeans to work

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,168
One for him he's got a tattoo of a medicine wheel the other the other form is a tattoo of a shield

18
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
Wood eagle feather

19
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,032
Ron's job is to make sure that people are not ripping off his

20
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,848
Casino and to do that he spends a lot of his time

21
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,152
In the casinos Situation Room

22
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:53,248
There's monitor wall there's monitors in front of the workers

23
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,528
And it's really dark room

24
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
But how many screens are we talk

25
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,136
Anywhere between

26
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,208
3240

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,816
Some people are just flipping through the screens looking for bad dude doing bad thing

28
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,608
Correct

29
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,680
We wanted to talk to Ryan about the specific

30
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,216
Crew of Bad Dudes

31
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,032
That he dealt with back in 2014

32
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,848
That summer he started hearing this rumor

33
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,896
About this crew of Russian guys

34
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,432
Who would roll up

35
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,224
Find your favorite slot machine

36
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,576
Play it for a few hours and then walk out with thousands of dollars

37
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,624
Rumor had it they never lie

38
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
One day in July

39
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Ron gets a

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,536
It's a friend of his who also works in the casino Security in

41
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
He said

42
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Hey bro

43
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,448
You got the Russian guys landed in LAX

44
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
One of them has a

45
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,056
Reservation at a hotel Reddit

46
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Street from you

47
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,640
So it looks like they're going to be at your place pretty soon

48
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,968
So when you get a call like that like what is your reaction

49
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Let's get to work

50
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
First order of business

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Keep an eye out

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,464
Ron's body sense of photographs of the Russian guy so they know who they're looking for

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
And shirt off

54
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
Ron gets a call from one of his age

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
He said we got him

56
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:11,840
He's here

57
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,376
By the time Ron gets

58
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:17,216
Situation Room they've got four cameras watching the skies every move

59
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
And that first run says

60
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
You didn't notice anything unusual

61
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,360
He was wearing a jacket and he had a satchel

62
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
Fingers jeans

63
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Typical guy

64
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,552
Put money in the machine press some buttons to decide how much to bet

65
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
And then press another button

66
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Spinning reels

67
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,440
If the reels lineup in a winning combination

68
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,744
The aces or whatever the guy wins

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
If they line up in some random order he loses

70
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,376
It's not something that you should be able to be good at

71
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,192
But Ron is watching this guy and he's winning

72
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
Over and over and

73
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
Over

74
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
Imran starts to notice

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,848
2 weird things about how the guy is

76
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
Play

77
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
First the way he's betting

78
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
You replace small money

79
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
And then he would put in large amount of money

80
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
And then he would play Max bet

81
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,416
So he's like putting in like a penny a penny a penny and then all the sudden he's better than $5

82
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
Correct

83
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
And then

84
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,000
Then the machine would hit

85
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
Your pull the money out and then it would start

86
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
A penny a penny a penny a penny

87
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
Put in $100

88
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Play Max

89
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
And then he would cash

90
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,544
As he was doing this over and over and over again and that's the that's typically not what

91
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Patrons do

92
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
You sure he wasn't just really lucky

93
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Positive

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,968
The second weird thing that Ron notices

95
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,296
The Russian guy keeps one of his hands buried in his bag

96
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,344
Yeah everytime he would put money in it

97
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,368
And he was spending

98
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,440
Hitting the back button and spinning the reels

99
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,976
His hand would be in a satchel

100
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
And then as soon as that was done in both hands

101
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
Would come out

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,608
And maybe get some more money and then

103
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
Start that process all over again

104
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,728
Ron is almost certain that this guy is cheating

105
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,848
The run is not a cop so it's not like he can go down on the casino floor and just arrest

106
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
Instead he calls up

107
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
California Department of Justice

108
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Stephen says

109
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Hey

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,552
I think I've got one of these Russian guys here you want to come down and pick him up

111
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:13,952
It takes three whole hours for the California doj guide to show up

112
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,744
The traffic but he finally get there

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,559
Just as the Russian guy is about to leave

114
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
With his thousands of dollars

115
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Doj

116
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,423
Walks up behind him says amen

117
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
How you doing

118
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Where

119
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,663
And the first thing is the doj reach didn't reached into his pocket because he didn't want any type of device to be wiped

120
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015
Ron what were you thinking at that moment

121
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,647
I think

122
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
Expletive yeah

123
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
You know what we got him

124
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,911
Do you literally in your mind are you just saying expletive gallon exciting things have

125
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
I do

126
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,519
I don't I don't curse so I just say expletive yeah

127
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
But

128
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,615
The trouble is Ron Flores and the doj agent

129
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,967
Basically have no idea how the Russian guy is winning so much money

130
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,759
Or if he's even actually cheating

131
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,807
Winning money at a slot machine

132
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
And being rushed

133
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
Turned out not to be

134
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
Quite enough evidence

135
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
The charge the guy with a crime

136
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
The doj agent

137
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,767
Behold the guy for as long as you can

138
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
But then he has to let him go

139
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
The guy get on the next plane to Russia

140
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
Leave the country

141
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
This guy's gone

142
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:33,055
Expletive.

143
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:39,455
Hello and welcome to Planet Money time Keith Romer and I'm bouncing a slot machine is supposed to work on

144
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
Enchant luck

145
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:47,135
But the way of slot machine decides who wins and who loses is not completely random nose

146
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,439
Russians with their hands buried in their bags

147
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,071
They had figured out a way to take advantage of the difference between real honest-to-goodness luck

148
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,143
And what is actually happening inside those slot machine

149
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,447
Play on the show a crime caper

150
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:06,847
Wrapped in hardcore computer science wrapped in layers and layers of hundred dollar bills

151
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
We'd like to say a quick thank you and share a message from one of our sponsors state

152
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,831

157
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
State Farm

158
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:44,991
Here to help life go right Nick

159
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,831
First heard about this story when you sent me an article from Wired Magazine

160
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
Buy a journalist named Brendan

161
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,647
Straight Outta

162
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,767
What was so interesting about the story was not just that somebody wanted to rip off

163
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Because

164
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
Of course somebody wanted to rip off a

165
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
What was so

166
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,399
Interesting

167
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Was how

168
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,239
Genuinely clever these guys way of ripping off a cat

169
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,079
Yeah when we talked to Ron Flores he said he had never seen

170
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Anything like it

171
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
And he has seen

172
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
A lot of cheese

173
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
In the old days

174
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
The cheats were a lot less sophisticated

175
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
What is Rush

176
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,367
Well it went from Fast beating stringing

177
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,159
Monkey paw the light one

178
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,767
With fast beating you just put your quarters in the slot machine really fast and the Machine kazoo

179
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
Credit for more than you put in

180
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,631
Stringing slightly more advanced version of the same idea

181
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:39,007
Stringing is where they would put the coin on the string and they wouldn't and they would bounce it up and down it inside the slot

182
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,823
You could also mess with the way the machines paid out

183
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,175
Monkey monkey monkey pot is his flexible rod

184
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,527
You got a claw on the end of it and you slide the monkey pop-up the payout

185
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,599
The claw lifts up a little lever that supposed to be

186
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
Keep track of how many quarters the machine is spit out

187
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
Jackpot

188
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,487
Slot machine designer swap out that

189
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
Physical lever for an optical

190
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,607
Which brings the light one light wand

191
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:11,263
Which is basically just a tiny little flashlight on a wand that they can shove up the coin shoot to trick that new up

192
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
Okay So eventually we get

193
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
To the modern era of slot

194
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,919
Did you get rid of all the coin slot nonsense

195
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,991
And you replace the inside of the machine with

196
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
A computer

197
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
Today if you crack open a sloppy

198
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,343
It's basically like

199
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
Taking the top off your desktop

200
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,463
Which introduces this new way for cheaters to cheat

201
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
Popsicle Pete

202
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
Where you at drill hole into the machine

203
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,447
This one is maybe apocryphal but run Flora says once you drill that hole in the machine

204
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,007
You take a can of freon

205
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
You turn it upside down

206
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,127
Shooting in the hall and basically just freeze the computers brains in

207
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Until it starts malfunctioning

208
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Spitting out jackpot

209
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
Soaked in his mind

210
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Ron has

211
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,039
This giant catalog

212
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
How old is she

213
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Cheat a slot machine

214
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,415
But all those cheats involved physically tampering with a machine song

215
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,231
The Russian guy who got arrested at Pechanga

216
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
He didn't do that

217
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,327
Civic Center Ron has a theory about what's going on

218
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,679
It was something to do with the way that guy's hand was always hidden in his satchel

219
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
Something to do with his phone

220
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
And he was not alone in thinking

221
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,567
Yeah so many casinos

222
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
Across the country have been hit

223
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
That the FBI

224
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,199
The FBI does not like Russia

225
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,247
They do not

226
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,319
And when they had heard that one of these Russians have been caught

227
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,903
The immediately put a call out to California doj and said

228
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
Hey do you mind sending us those phone so we can take a look

229
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
Richard finneran is a federal prosecutor in Missouri

230
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
He says

231
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,679
That Russian guy in California he was not working alone this was a

232
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,447
Big R

233
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,079
I think our list of potential Associates is probably at one point is large is about 25 or 30 ft

234
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
Now it's against the law in most

235
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
States to use an electronic device

236
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Ways to mess with the outcome

237
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Of a slot machine

238
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,367
But if finneran can't figure out how the Russians are using their phone it's not like he's going to be able to win in

239
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
Dearest Jerry these guys are winning a lot at slot machines

240
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Also there

241
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,535
Touching their cell phones while they're doing right it's not

242
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
The strongest

243
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631
Bittern had some guesses about what was actually going

244
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
If a slot machine

245
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Is just a computer

246
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,543
Then maybe these guys were using their phones to somehow

247
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
The programs on one of those

248
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,199
Which would explain why the Russians are always hitting the same slot machine

249
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:32,063
What is all the same make and model of slot machine game that we're producing these results

250
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
What was that make and model

251
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,927
That was the Aristocrat Mark 6 machine

252
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,279
Finneran has an FBI agent call out the Aristocrat the company that made the Mark 6

253
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,351
But Aristocrat says it finneran hacking Siri

254
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
It's not possible

255
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,983
We learned that the software this machines was basically too old

256
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
To be hot

257
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,335
There's no Wifi or Bluetooth or anything like that in the Mark 6

258
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,151
So there isn't even a way for the Russians phone to

259
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Communicate

260
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
Put the slot machines computer

261
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,271
So if no one was physically tampering with

262
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
The machine

263
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,575
And no one was hacking it

264
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
It was basically only one other possibility

265
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
Someone had figured out how to predict

266
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
What the machine was going to do

267
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,023
Before it did it

268
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,327
Someone had to reverse-engineer the marks

269
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,655
We weren't even sure if this was actually

270
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Ausable

271
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
So we call them an expert

272
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
His name is Leo raisin

273
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
And he teaches

274
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
Computer science at Boston University

275
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
Could you reverse engineer a slot machine

276
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Me personally no but I could

277
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
Probably tell you you know you know a guy

278
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
I know a guy no

279
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
I know many students

280
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
We're really good at it

281
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,255
I know many many people in the industry for a really good at it

282
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
And if you put a team together and you pay them enough money

283
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
They would certainly be able to do

284
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,215
Leo says to understand why the Mark 6 was

285
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
Right Ferb reverse engineering

286
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
Think about what computers are good at

287
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
Record of a computer

288
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
Is

289
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
A processor that

290
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,735
Takes one instruction at a time at night

291
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
Add one in

292
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,575
Check the value of x 270

293
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
The more of these instructions you string together

294
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
The more complicated task UK

295
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,791
Move the cursor over a few spaces show some cherries on the screen

296
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
Land a probe on Mars

297
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
The one that predictable outcome

298
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
For predictable sequence of instruction

299
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,007
We wanted to do the same thing the same way every

300
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:34,175
We wanted to do the same thing the same way every time so that when we simulate the probe landing on Mars and then we send the floor plan

301
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
To Mars It Will

302
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Do the same

303
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,319
Put the computer in a slot machine has a very different job

304
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
It's supposed to be

305
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Opposite of pro

306
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,743
I mean think about it if you could predict what a slot machine was going to do ahead of time

307
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
You would just

308
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,351
BET right before you knew it was going to go Terry Terry Terry Terry Terry

309
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
And you would win a lot of money

310
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,191
Write a slot machine is supposed

311
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
To be random

312
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
But Leo says that

313
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
Hat being unpredictable

314
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Creating Randy

315
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
That is really hard drive

316
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Computers

317
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
It goes against their nature

318
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
In fact it is impossible

319
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
Free computer to generate

320
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
True randomness

321
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
It's all in it

322
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
Instead of a computer creates

323
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
What Leo calls

324
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
Pseudo rate

325
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
And here that works

326
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
It has some starting 929

327
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:24,095
No 2461 longer than both of those numbers and had number is called

328
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
Accede

329
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,935
And the computer that runs the seed through a bunch of

330
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
Really complicated math problems

331
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,031
Until it spits out a new number

332
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,311
Rinse repeat

333
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,639
The better your pseudo random number generator is

334
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
The harder it is

335
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,223
Predict what number it will spit out next

336
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
The very best ones even if you took

337
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,575
All the computers in the world it would take

338
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
Very long time to figure out

339
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,951
Pattern today they take longer to crack than a few lifetimes

340
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,767
Billions and billions

341
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
But not all pseudo random number generator

342
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Hazard that

343
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
If the random number generator is bad

344
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,263
Then it could take you 10 observations and then you figure out the entire sea

345
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:08,383
Having a good pseudo random number generator instead of a bad one

346
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
Turned out to matter for a lot more than just

347
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Slot machines

348
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Joe

349
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,039
Every time you use your credit card on the internet

350
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,111
It is encrypted using something called and encryption

351
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
Which is just

352
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,951
It's like a long string of numbers and letters and symbols

353
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
It's gibberish

354
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,791
Matki tells whoever is receiving them

355
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,607
The computer on the other end how to translate what it's

356
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
To keep that

357
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,239
Kia secret from the bad guys you have to make it impossible to predict

358
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,799
If something is impossible to predict Leo says

359
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
Nothing is random pseudo random

360
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Pseudo-random

361
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:44,991
The point is that without really sophisticated pseudo random number generators

362
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
We will be super vulnerable to bag

363
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
Luckyleo says

364
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Computer scientist

365
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Figured all this out decades

366
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,183
People who

367
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
How are in the

368
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Photography community

369
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:03,167
Have known about this work since the 80s and have understood how to build Unbreakable

370
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
Pseudo random number generator

371
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
Raiders

372
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
But

373
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,055
A scientific research takes a long time to get disseminated

374
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
I'm interaction

375
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
Sol practice

376
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Some companies

377
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
Took a while to catch up

378
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Some

379
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
Slot machine

380
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
After the break

381
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,831
We learn the Russian Secret

382
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
Turned out beating slot machines

383
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
There's an app for that

384
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,791
Support for Planet Money and the following message come from ishares

385
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
Because the best preparation for tomorrow

386
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
Is building for your future today

387
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
Ishares by BlackRock

388
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
Inspired to build

389
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,127
Remember back at the beginning of the show there was that Russian guy who got arrested

390
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:44,895
Did Ron Flores

391
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
Casino in California

392
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,271
And then they released him and then he got on the next plane to Russia

393
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,087
It turns out that the Russian guy

394
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
Was not all that important

395
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
What was important

396
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Where his phone

397
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
The Russian guy flees the country

398
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:05,887
But his phone's get sent to an FBI lab for like the phone version of an interrogator

399
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,959
They were all iPhones iPhone 5S

400
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
That's Richard finneran again

401
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,799
The prosecutor from before who ran the investigation in

402
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
Into the slot cheating

403
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Veteran says

404
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
When they analyzed the phone

405
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
They find all the usual iPhone

406
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,503
But then there is one app that they have never seen

407
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Shepherd

408
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
It sounds like a movie villain

409
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:27,391
Severn is not in the app store by the way

410
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,463
And when investigators start looking and its code

411
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
Define lots of

412
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,327
Clues that Severn probably has something to do with

413
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,607
Predicting a slot machine

414
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:43,263
There were Lan files that contain references to things that were taking place on the slot machine games

415
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
So

416
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,335
Phrases like strong seed

417
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,639
R&G threads done

418
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:54,271
So what the suspects would do is they would learn a series of swiping and tapping patterns

419
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
The correspondent

420
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,855
To the symbols they would see on the machine

421
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
Finneran actually emailed us a copy of

422
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Have the key

423
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,047
Different swipes on the iPhone screen correspond to different symbols on the slot machine

424
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
Like Morse code

425
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:12,191
Nick are you ready for quiz yes okay. And then swipe right

426
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:12,959
Diamond

427
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,007
I swiped left twice

428
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
Cherry Mountain Lion swipe right then swipe down

429
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,407
I don't know if I know any other simple hit the crystal

430
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:26,015
Each time one of these Russian guys pushes the button to spend the reels on a slot machine

431
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
He enters on his phone whatever shows up on the screen

432
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
The screen shows

433
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,183
Lion Crystal King Lion Crystal

434
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:39,583
He swiped in that code on his phone and then all that information gets sent to a bunch of different servers in a bunch of different country

435
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,911
And we traced the connections

436
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,727
I'm all the way from Washington State

437
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,751
To London

438
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
And ultimately to a server in St Peter

439
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,615
Russia

440
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
Saint Petersburg Florida

441
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:59,039
Finneran thinks the folks back in St Petersburg have their own copy of an aristocrat Mark 6

442
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
Open it up

443
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,647
Figured out what kind of pseudo random number generator it was running

444
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
And then just watched it spit out numbers

445
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:10,303
Yeah that's how you would reverse engineer a pseudo random number generator slot machine

446
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,399
You just watch it for awhile record the stream of numbers that produces

447
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,215
Until you figure out the pad or your computer figures

448
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,519
Yeah your computer you're not smart enough

449
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
And then

450
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Then you make an app

451
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Tavern

452
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
The scary name when you say that

453
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
So the app

454
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,479
Feed all the data from all the spin

455
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
On the American side machine

456
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,831
Fees that back to a server in Russia

457
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
The computer in Russia analyze that data

458
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,207
And it's some point it starts to be able to predict

459
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:43,071
When a slot machine is about to pay out send a signal back to the cheaters phone back in the US

460
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
Says bet now

461
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,655
Eventually the FBI tracks

462
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,447
Two of them and on their list of suspects

463
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,239
To casino in Illinois

464
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,335
They let them in play Slots just long enough to incriminate themselves

465
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
And then they pop

466
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,175
Please search their hotel rooms arrest two more guys

467
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
Find a whole mess of phones

468
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
Load it up with the Severn app

469
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,295
And almost $70,000 in

470
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Cash

471
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
One of the men is released for lack of evidence

472
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:12,255
The other three though are charged with conspiracy and Interstate and foreign travel in

473
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
In furtherance of unlawful Act

474
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,911
And then ultimately they all plead guilty and were sentenced to two years of Peace in prison

475
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
Finneran thinks they send a message

476
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,567
As far as he knows there have not been any cases of slot cheating like this in the US

477
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
Since the arrest in 20

478
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,503
The last year in Singapore police arrested a check man Filipino woman and 4 Russians for using their phone

479
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
Cheat at slots

480
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,135
Toledo raising the computer science Professor we talked to earlier

481
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,463
This is not a story about people breaking the law

482
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:47,583
This is a story about how companies don't always take responsibility for the security of the Technologies

483
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
Yeah the whole hacking angle

484
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,167
He doesn't buy it

485
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,215
I would not call these machines hacked

486
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
I would call them watched

487
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Hack suggest that somebody

488
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Change the machine

489
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:04,479
Did something to to make its Behavior not the way it's supposed to be but it's behaving exactly

490
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
You push the button that gives you a payout

491
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,343
You just need to know when to push the button to get a bigger fat

492
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,439
The Aristocrat Mark 6 comes in all these different flavor

493
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:20,095
You got star Drifter this one called Pelican Pete and you might think that when something like this happens all the Pelicans

494
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
Skip taken off of all the

495
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,519
We asked Ron Flores the casino surveillance guy from the top the show

496
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,847
Can we still play a Mark 6 at your Casino

497
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Maybe

498
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,343
If I want to play Pelican Pete can I play it at Pechanga

499
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,463
That is a direct question and I liked it

500
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
However

501
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,815
Probably not going to answer

502
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,959
Well played Ron Flores well played

503
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:03,359
We should say we reached out to Aristocrat the company that manufactures the mark 6A declined a recorded interview

504
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,895
View but noted in a statement

505
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
That

506
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,551
While reports of cheats are rare this issue is a challenge for all manufacturers regulators

507
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
And operator

508
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
They also noted that around the world

509
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,440
There are currently more than

510
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
Hundred thousand Mark 6

511
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
Still in operation

512
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:28,192
Do you know how to hack a machine that has lots of money inside

513
