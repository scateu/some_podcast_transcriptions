00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,096
The trade war with China was one of the biggest economic stories of

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,376
2018

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,400
Import taxes

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,216
Is ungood that were sold from China into the US

5
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:10,752
Cost American businesses

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,032
Billions of dollars

7
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,872
And these tears could also be part of why China experience

8
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,664
Its lowest level of economic growth

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,944
In nearly 30 years

10
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,248
Yeah biggest trade is global

11
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
When tariffs are put in place between two giant economies like the US and China the economic impact Ripple all over the

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
The effects can be a norm

13
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,280
But also tariffs end up affecting a lot of people on a very

14
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
Individual

15
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,096

The trade war with China continues to escalate

123
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
The Chinese government this morning announcing its going to impose new tariffs on 16 billion dollars worth of us Goods

124
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
Among the US Goods that China started taxing

This happen

129
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599

00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,583
Really tried to make sure that there is no flying debris coming my way

132
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,471
Category 4 hurricane winds coming in

00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
And baby got up at mom for daylight and I was going out with

134
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
Spotlight looking at my

135
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
I can see what was left behind here

136
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
Gardening

137
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,759
We went some for you isn't it just look like it was devastated

138
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
David lost about a third of his

139
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Cotton crop

140
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
And a couple of fields

141
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
The peanuts 2

142
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
That show you with the peanut

143
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
You know

144
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,279
Oh it is Sandy this is sandy soil

145
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,815
She get on that he

146
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Is it peanuts on the ground there

147
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
That's what was left

148
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Left after

149
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Through the storm

150
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,543
Peanuts grow underground like potatoes and his field have peanuts all over the dirt

151
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
David picked a couple of but they were rotten

152
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,407
From all the water from the Storm shows come soft

153
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
My partner's hands

154
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:43,039
Say that was a good thing that when it came out and it just somehow

155
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,855
It didn't we lost some at the storm

156
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
This is the thing that got hurt

157
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
The peanuts and cotton that did survive

158
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,279
Walk straight out of a storm and into a trade War

159
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,607
U.s. gun cotton peanut butter all hit by terrorists

160
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,935
And China is one of the biggest importers of American peanut butter in

161
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
In Cotton

162
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
And suddenly China was

163
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,543
Taxing those Imports by as much as 25

164
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
10%

165
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,383
That's a lot

166
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,247
Will you imagine you've said you been farming for 50 years you've definitely seen

167
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,575
Difficult periods before have you ever dealt with with

168
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,599
Tariffs before

169
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,415
No I've never never had to deal with tears

170
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
You know this photo taken

171
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
Flashlight that says in my 50 years

172
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,535
Oh so this is new

173
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
Yeah this is all new to me

174
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
Chinese peanut butter in Cotton orders from

175
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
The US collapsed over

176
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,703
And the price that David

177
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
Who's getting for his peanuts in Cotton

178
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
Both fell by about 30%

179
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,079
So

180
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
Because of the storm

181
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:42,687
You lost quite a bit of your cotton crop and some of your peanut crop

182
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,455
But then also

183
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,783
Because of tariffs the amount of money that you're getting for the crop that had that

184
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,807
Is left

185
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Was like not a tie

186
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
It hurts both ways

187
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,183
David and his fellow Farmers ended up in the

188
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Weird situation

189
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
Outside of the typical laws of sir

190
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Supply and demand

191
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,095
Because normally when the Spy something goes down

192
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
The price of that product

193
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,143
It goes up

194
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,679
Your penis in the world because

195
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Storm but

196
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
People still want

197
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Peanut butter

198
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,823
So the price of peanut butter goes up and the price that farmers get for their peanuts

199
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Goes up

200
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
But this was not a normal situation

201
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,431
The storm hit around the same time that

202
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
The trade War took

203
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Affect

204
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
US made peanut butter was suddenly way more expensive

205
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Super Chinese buffet

206
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,671
So the man from those buyers went down in the price of peanuts also went

207
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,207
Instead of up

208
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,047
Chinese Imports of us made peanut butter peanuts and cotton tank

209
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,375
And what had been shaping up to be one of the best years in David's

210
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
Entire farming career

211
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
Turned into one of the worst years Pete ever seen

212
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
You know what we plan to make a lot of money this year but

213
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,407
Lower didn't see fit part but maybe next year he's going to bless us better

214
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
But hopefully we going to break even

215
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,247
Break even

216
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
And theaters

217
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
He is one of the lucky one

218
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:55,135
There's some Farmers just worried you know that I've heard him talk

219
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,439
Inside I don't know if I'm going to survive this

220
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Astronaut

221
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
You know is this heartbreaking

222
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,815
David says the economic effects of

223
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
The storm in the

224
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
Keras haven't just

225
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
Hit the farmers

226
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
They hit the whole area

227
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,495
It's hurting a whole community and equipment dealers

228
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
The guy down the street with the hardware store

229
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
We're not going to buy

230
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Spend money

231
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
Is we did is prettiest

232
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,711
Because we don't have it

233
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
And everybody say

234
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,855
Spite of everything though David actually supports the terror

235
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,207
I thought well that's not good for the farmer right now but I think it's the right thing to do

236
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
You know because the trade balance

237
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Soul on fire

238
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
And I think President Trump done today

239
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,631
Right thing in my opinion

240
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
I think he did a good

241
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
It heard us right now but I think in the long run it'll happen

242
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,103
David thinks the macroeconomic issues between the US and China are important enough

243
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
But the sacrifice bills worth it

244
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,967
He said most of the pharmacies talk to feel the same way

245
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,783
Now that the government is providing millions of dollars in

246
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
The cotton farmer

247
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
And supplementing a lot of

248
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
Peanut Lofts

249
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,159
But David says it doesn't make up for

250
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,207
Everything doesn't make up for all the law

251
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,279
At the start of this month a bill that would have provided

252
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,583
Disaster relief to Farmers affected by

253
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
Michael

254
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Failed to pass

255
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,959
The Senate and on top of that nobody knows how long the Terrace

256
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
Continue

257
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
And

258
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,591
Well they're going on China could just lock down peanut and cotton

259
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
Supplies from other parts of the world

260
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
Even if the trade war end soon

261
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,503
The Chinese market for us peanuts

262
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
And peanut butter and cotton

263
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,855
Might never come back to where it was before

264
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
But David says

265
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
He is not going to switch

266
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
Leather crop now there's anybody he knows

267
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,767
They're going to continue growing cotton and peanuts

268
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Just like always

269
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
Why is that

270
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,167
Listen to blood

271
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
You know it's what they've always doing

272
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
M&M peanuts is good crop to grow

273
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,567
You know and that's use the money in them

274
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
If you make it good to you

275
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
And

276
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
I just like to see him grow

277
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,271
Hi Josie and good peanuts just this empty heart

Happiness

289
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
It is

290
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,599
The thing we are all striving for in life right and it is how you achieve

291
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,671
The Good Life yes but it can be so elusive

292
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
What makes you happy

293
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Relationships

294
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
Do your job

295
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Money

296
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Coffee

297
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,911
Absolutely better for me at a stronger reaction to

298
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,471
Coffee and some money which is a little odd

299
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,519
But seriously it is hard to know

300
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
And

301
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,127
Can feel even harder to know precisely because it is so difficult to measure

302
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
Back to people

303
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:04,063
Are uneasy about how you might measure that may have been why

304
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,415
Economics became narrower than it should have been a couple of centuries ago

305
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
This is economist John hello

306
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,791
John is with the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of

307
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
British Columbia

308
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,655
What are the editors of the world happiness report the world

309
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
John and his team released the first one back in

310
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
12

311
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:28,127
11 things that uses six measures to help gauge and rank the happiness of different countries

312
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
And one for 2018 Jetta

313
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
Just came out

314
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,503
Today's indicator is 90

315
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,831
Happiness report rated all the countries in the world in

316
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,855
Terms of their happiness

317
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,695
And of course I immediately just looked at the list to see where the US was in

318
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,999
And it wasn't number 19

319
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
Behind Belgium

320
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Number 18

321
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Israel at 30

322
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Australia

323
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,399
Number 11

324
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
Yes we were also behind

325
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Iceland

326
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
Which is in fourth place

327
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,311
In third place is Norway and in second place

328
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,335
Is Denmark

329
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,991
Of course John helliwell told me that not obsessing about rankings was actually one of the secrets for the country that came in

330
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,015
Men at number one

331
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
And it isn't it ironic

332
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
The happiest country on Earth

333
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Finland

334
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,183
Sanya village in the end

335
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
There's things called

336
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
The Jones effect

337
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
This is the idea that people

338
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
Think of their rank as being important

339
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,423
It was just like keeping up with the Joneses

340
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,775
Just exactly

341
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,871
Does this mean one of the reasons that Finland is so happy is because they don't

342
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Care

343
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
About how much happier they are than everybody else

344
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,735
John said

345
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
Exactly yes

346
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
We've talked to Finn

347
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,671
It's not your problem there is elsewhere

348
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
CC no actually

349
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,767
We don't think it is in the reason is

350
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,095
This is kind of a social Norm in Finland that you don't

351
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,911
Play you're welcome you don't talk about your income

352
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
We consume

353
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,335
And they didn't said that means he's comparator effects

354
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,127
Or more or less absent there

355
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
So

356
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,175
Finland for the win

357
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,455
Happiest place on earth

358
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,783
Not that they're bothering to rub it in

359
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
Too busy dealing with

360
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,135
Six months of darkness

361
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
It's right

362
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,999
Hashtags USA still winning in the light

363
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
All right all right

364
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
Okay but not of the economics

365
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:24,863
The whole thing

366
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
How do you measure happiness

367
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:32,799
John helliwell says there are six measures that they used to help determine a country's rank in the happiness report

368
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,895
Some of them are pretty standard economic measures and some of them are

369
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
A little

370
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,991
Squishier wishing yeah

371
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:44,319
Two of them are standard development indicators

372
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,159
Which is GDP per capita and healthy life expect

373
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,487
Life expectancy one that's pretty straightforward

374
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
Gross domestic product per capita

375
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,887
So gross domestic product is basically the sum total of all the goods and services

376
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,423
The country produces in a year

377
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,471
And per capita per person

378
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,055
Basically give a rough idea of how wealthy

379
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
People are in a particular country

380
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
Measure number three has to do with

381
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,735
How much people trust the government and businesses inside their

382
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,087
Corruption is a problem in your country and business

383
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,391
And then a second one in government

384
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,951
And then we take the average of those two

385
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,743
So life expectancy

386
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
GDP per capita

387
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
Corruption

388
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,095
And the fourth happiness indicator

389
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
Something called social support

390
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
Secular Gallup question is

391
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,519
You have somebody account on in times of trouble number 5

392
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
Generosity

393
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
National average

394
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,687
It's based on have you been generous in the last 30 days

395
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Two others

396
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
Binary number 6

397
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,087
Freedom he was at the freedom to make your key life

398
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,927
That's very important across country

399
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,463
So in some

400
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
To measure happy

401
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
John and his

402
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Team used measures of

403
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
GDP per capita

404
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Life expectancy

405
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Corruption

406
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
Social support

407
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,191
Generosity

408
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
And freedom

409
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
And the reason that he used

410
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,823
D6 measures is because they had been found

411
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Be highly correlated

412
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,151
With people's overall happiness

413
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:17,247
But John says there are two that seem especially powerfully correlated with

414
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Number one

415
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Social support

416
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,623
That is do you have people you can count on in times of trouble

417
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
Number two

418
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
GDP per capita

419
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Yep

420
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Money

421
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
For the most part

422
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
Hire a country

423
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Top it off

424
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
The happier

425
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,399
But John finds out there are

426
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
A few notable exceptions to

427
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
China

428
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
India

429
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
And

430
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
The US

431
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:46,175
I know I know in all three countries GDP per capita was up between 2017 and 2018

432
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:50,015
But happiness levels as John and his team measure them were down

433
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,319
And this is something that Economist refer to

434
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,367
To add the easterlin paradox

435
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
It's the idea that wealth adds to be

436
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
People's happiness

437
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,719
Only up to a point

438
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
And at some point

439
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
For some reason

440
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Getting richer

441
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Cops make

442
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Making you happier

443
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,863
John thinks that

444
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,447
Paradox is happening for different reasons in China and India versus

445
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
The US

446
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,615
In China and India John thinks they're experiencing a kind of disruptive effect that often comes along with an economy that the

447
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Balding really fast

448
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,479
The decline of the extended family

449
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,575
And the elimination of a lot of these social ties

450
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
Social support

451
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
And the

452
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,415
Cute

453
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,999
Movements away from the countryside towards the cities

454
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,559
Have posed problems for happiness

455
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Even if

456
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
Income per capita Rose a lot

457
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,935
USS John says he thinks the paradox

458
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,983
She's been caused by something else in

459
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:42,751
Hayirli

460
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,079
People overestimate the happiness they're going to get from

461
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,871
Boring, or a bigger house

462
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,687
And they underestimate the happiness

463
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,735
They would get from more time with

464
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
Show me end up

465
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
Finding themselves

466
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,927
In circumstances to where they've chosen

467
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Pickle fork

468
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,767
Too high an income too much consumption

469
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,095
Not enough time to spend with family and friends

470
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,655
And they end up being anxious Harry

471
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
Stressed

472
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
There are other ideas about why the

473
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Chilling Paradox existence

474
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:22,687
What is it could be that GDP is growing so GDP per capita is going up but then it's less evenly spread by the poppy

475
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Deletion that used to be

476
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,271
So people aren't happy about growing inequality

477
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087
And some Economist say that the

478
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:33,183
Easterlin Paradox isn't really a thing that it all depends on

479
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:33,951
How hot

480
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
This is measured because

481
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
As we said before

482
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
It's a really really tricky

483
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,327
Anything to nail down

484
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Nonetheless

485
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
John says

486
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,703
Humans are priorities do seem to play a major role in our happiness

487
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,287
Becky says researching happiness has changed his own private

488
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
I used to be more

489
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
Discbound

490
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
More solitary

491
00:17:54,175 --> 00:18:00,319
And the more inclined to read the elevator since they safety certificate rather than talk to the other

492
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,111
Open the elevator

493
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
And what I've learned in these years is that that's

494
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
Sleep bad psychology

495
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,327
To start conversations with strangers 2

496
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
Why would people in the streets

497
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,447
To assume the best rather than the worst about them

498
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,799
It's a win-win situation and so I I do it more than I

499
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:24,127
Are you stupid and that's improve my happiness and I hope it's a

500
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,503
Easy for you to say your in Canada you guys are number 9

501
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,623

502

Yeah we are going to climb the happiness rankings

505
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,279
Even if it makes us miserable

506
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,839
Alright elevators

507
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,375
Happiness.

The bags help or hurt the environment

531
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
