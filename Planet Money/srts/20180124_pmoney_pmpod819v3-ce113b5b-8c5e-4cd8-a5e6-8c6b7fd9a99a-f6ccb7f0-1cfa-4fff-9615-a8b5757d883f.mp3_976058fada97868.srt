Presenting this mess

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,632
When it comes to investing

4

Tips and information about investing

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
Before you invest

Investor.gov

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
Douglas Bruce loves

11
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,760
The Constitution of the United States of America

12
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,112
If I could carry the little pocket version of it everywhere Side by Clarence Thomas

13
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,648
Define the way to work

14
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,952
Fusion into just about every conversation

15
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,488
The Constitution

16
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:36,608
Says an Article 28 and article 6 says I'm going to quote it verbatim

17
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,680
And that's guaranteed in Article 1

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:46,336
That's what special constitutional right did this the first time I met him and he even got choked up talking about

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
About the founding fathers

20
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:52,224
The Constitution Bruce left the most of the Bill of Rights that's the section about freedom

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,624
Speech religion right to speedy trial and Bruce likes it because to him it is the original

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,904
Limit on governor

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,488
It even begins with the words Congress shall make no law

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,280
First lives in Colorado Springs

25
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,864
He's a former lawyer and he owns a bunch of Real Estate

26
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
And he starts

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,704
Thinking hard about the Bill of Rights

28
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:19,360
The drafters of the Constitution were pretty smart guys but there is at least one limit on government that they didn't

29
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,432
They forgot to limit the right of government

30
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,968
To Levy taxes

31
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,576
On up on the people you can say you're free if the government can take away everything you have

32
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
What about your permit

33
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,160
Douglas Bruce decided he was going to

34
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,208
Fix this little oversight

35
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:39,584
He wrote up a sequel to the Constitution he called it the taxpayers Bill of Rights

36
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
Tabor for sure

37
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,448
And he said just like the people have a freedom of assembly right

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Trial by jury

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
They should have a right

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
To vote

41
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
On their own tax

42
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
Everytime a government raises your taxes

43
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,944
They should have to ask your permission first

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
It was radick

45
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,784
It's incredibly difficult to plop concept

46
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
And then

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
The state of Colorado

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Actually passed it

49
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
Planet Money I'm Robert Smith from Colorado Public Radio Rachel at herco reporters

50
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,584
At CPR

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,192
Then the minor and Ben Marcus I've just finished a podcast series called the taxman

52
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,520
It's about how a man who held no political office

53
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
Just an abscessed Outsider ended up changing the very relationship between the citizens of a state

54
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:32,320
And their government what happens when you take away the politicians main power the power to

55
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:38,720
Erase texts it ended up putting Colorado on the brink of disaster and for Douglas Bruce it cost him

56
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
Reputation and eventually

57
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
His freedom aren't very sooner or later they're going to figure out some way to put me in jail I have no.

58
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
And he was right

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,848

65
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,904
Douglas Bruce sat down at his kitchen table

66
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,696
Colorado Springs in the 1980s

67
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,000
Old-fashioned typewriter sitting right in front of him

68
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,328
A bang out his version of this brand new law

69
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
The taxpayers

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,632
Bill

71
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
Rights

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,008
At the time Bruce had never served in government in any way

73
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,080
But he was something of a legal savant

74
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:32,480
Any real would look like a very simple law it said that whenever the state or local government in Colorado wants more

75
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,040
Our money wants to increase tax rate

76
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:39,392
It has to put the question on the ballot increased taxes for roads

77
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
Voters get to decide

78
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
You want better schools well that's

79
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
Your call.

80
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,144
Timber submitted this as a citizen initiative on Colorado ballot in 1988

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,544
Bruce thought it was a slam dunk people hate taxes and this measure would inevitably keep taxes down

82
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,896
What's not to love

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,272
They voted against it on Election night he Blaine

84
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
The voters

85
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
Basically said listen

86
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
You don't know what's good for you

87
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
And when the tax increases come

88
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
Don't bother calling me

89
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
For a reaction

90
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
I'll give you your Sound by

91
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Right

92
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,095
Now

93
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,631
Listen carefully

94
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
I

95
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,215
Told

96
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:26,751
You

97
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
So

98
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,871
For lot of people this would have been The Bitter End

99
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
Tax revenue

100
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Colorado

101
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
What does Bruce

102
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
Is not someone who gives

103
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
And he realized something about people in Thai

104
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Everyone's right

105
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,879
But when push comes to shove

106
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,695
People don't want to have their parts in their libraries closed

107
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
At their core the sort of

108
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,791
Afraid to limit.

109
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Afraid to limit tax

110
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,143
Clippers needed to sell this thing differently

111
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
I said

112
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
Well if

113
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
Change the bumper sticker

114
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,567
Instead of limit taxes were going to say vote on tax

115
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
Bruce essentially rebranded

116
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
The idea

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
Starving a government as

118
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
A fight for freedom

119
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
And that is not an exaggeration

120
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,295
He made his little pink index

121
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
Cards and toss them out on the

122
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
West Street

123
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,671
One guy in the campaign Fred Holden he still has one

124
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:23,327
What We Believe by Douglas Byrd believe in limited taxes not unlimited Got to Believe In the supreme power of the people not the special privileges

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,655
We believe in democracy not bureaucracy believe in individual

126
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,959
Responsibility not Collective guilt

127
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
It's time to send the politician a message

128
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
They won't forget it's time to stand up

129
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
For America

130
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,895
Big it felt like something the founding fathers would write

131
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,479
Douglas Brooks was here attacking the very Foundation of

132
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
A representative democracy

133
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,575
Do we trust the people we vote for to represent us

134
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,367
In the figure out the right amount of taxes

135
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,999
Which was not okay with everyone I mean Colorado's Governor at the time Roy Romer is it Democrat

136
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,815
He used an analogy where he called Bruce

137
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,583
Terrorist

138
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:00,447
Throwing a bomb into the Machinery of government I saw this man who had

139
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
A flame in his eye

140
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
I was passionate

141
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,799
He was over the top

142
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
Really I thought

143
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,455
And that's what would cause a terrorist comment has a weird sense of humor though

144
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:17,855
So this is what he did after the governor's comment

145
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
I got a business card that said

146
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
Karrueche Bruce Harris

147
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
He handed out a business card that said he was a terrorist amazing and this is

148
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
I feel like

149
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
Bruce was tapping into something that has obviously become more frequent today but was little more we're back then and now

150
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,567
Luckenbach

151
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
And belittle your political opponents

152
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
People eating up

153
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,503
People can't take her eyes off of him

154
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,135
He was always doing something out of the ordinary let's say like this one time he had a confrontation

155
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
With Colorado Secretary of

156
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
State Natalie Meyer

157
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
She got to approve

158
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,327
Tabor for the ballot so she was important here and

159
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,935
She had said that some of the signature is Bruce's side had collected to get it on the ballot

160
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
We're not valid

161
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,847
So he held a press conference in Denver just down the hall from the Secretary of State's office

162
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
The videotape

163
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
Tuesday it's amazing

164
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
The woman has obviously

165
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
Mental deficiency

166
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
You heard me

167
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,719
You heard me I thought you were leaving at this point Myers walking up the hallway towards Bruce and the reporters

168
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,791
And the TV Camera pivots to her and she is furious

169
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,839
Woman has obviously at what

170
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,399
As I was saying

171
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
Something

172
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,239
Dog got a little bit

173
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
I think you need to exam

174
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,079
Whether you're caught

175
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,663
That you are saying you represent is being hurt

176
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
By your verbiage

177
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:54,111
And you can't really continue this can you without being in court I feel like a secretary of state really stood up

178
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
To Douglas

179
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Bruce here

180
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
And came off

181
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
You're looking pretty good in this competition but

182
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
But legally she didn't

183
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
Tri Nguyen it

184
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,887
Yeah she backed off and the signatures were approved

185
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
So come up to the election of 1992

186
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
Tabor had

187
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,287
It's big ideas about Freedom the little pink index

188
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
Cards and heavy attention-getting antics

189
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
Of Douglas Bruce switch

190
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Was getting a lot of press

191
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
And then I got this

192
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Lucky little break

193
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
From National policy

194
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:26,367
Remember it's 1992 you got the incumbent George HW Bush

195
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
Running against Bill Clinton

196
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
And an independent in the race from Texas

197
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,559
You got to take away Congress has right to raise taxes

198
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,119
Now there's a radical idea Ross Perot

199
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,983
Ross Perot he was a populist in a campaign that was all about the rough economy

200
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:46,079
He said voters alone should have the ability to raise taxes

201
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,943
Now that sounds kind of familiar in Colorado right it's the same message as Douglas Bruce

202
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
But whereas Bruce was screaming it

203
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,879
Restroom baby ideas seem like Down Home Logic that your Pappy might tell you on the front porch

204
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,415
Drinking too much

205
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
Got to take the bottle away from him for a while at least

206
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
That if I need more money

207
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,351
Not the owner of the country sign up

208
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,887
The frogs just tucking

209
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
Theoretically on the national

210
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
Colorado this was now a real option on the ballot

211
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
And protocol

212
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
A lot of ads nationally

213
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,383
And his words were echoing in voters ears

214
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
As they went to

215
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,711
On Election Day the pools

216
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,759
For Tabor were really tight

217
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,319
Neither side was sure what would happen

218
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:33,695
Douglas Bruce got to the party in downtown Denver at the Embassy Suites around 8:30

219
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
So when I got there

220
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
People started

221
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,535
Aquatic

222
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
And I haven't heard the

223
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,239
Results of the radio and they said you know

224
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,263
It's now

225
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,079
We're at 49%

226
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,871
Rachel is the first time I

227
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
Her Douglas Bruce

228
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,175
Express emotion

229
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:59,807
Yeah I mean he doesn't have kids he doesn't have a family he's not married like this is his baby

230
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,111
Sm81 on the more conservative parts

231
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
State added their results

232
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
And it was clear

233
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
Tabor

234
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
What the taxpayers Bill of Rights

235
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,815
Was not law in Colorado

236
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
And Douglas Bruce

237
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,167
Still remembers the first words of his victory speech

238
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
The Liars lost

239
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
The wires lost

240
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
The people

241
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
1

242
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:21,823
People

243
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Kroger

244
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,039
We asked him what it felt like

245
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
Vindication

246
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
It was a

247
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
If I Die Tomorrow

248
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
We can't take it away from

249
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,423
I

250
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Am I crazy

251
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
I'm crazy about Micah

252
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
I'm crazy enough to believe

253
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
All those things we were told

254
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
School

255
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
About the

256
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
Consent of the governed

257
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
We the People

258
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,647
People in this hotel Ballroom are rat

259
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,207
All eyes on Douglas Bruce

260
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
We have taken away their crowbar

261
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
And for once

262
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
It is the politician

263
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
You got nails

264
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,263
All the sudden every elected official in Colorado

265
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Had to live by Bruce

266
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
Just rules

267
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
The taxpayers Bill of Rights

268
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Was now part of the state

269
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,943
Despite politicians worst fears

270
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,247
The sky did not fall

271
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
The economy boomed during the Clinton years

272
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:41,183
And during good years more tax money Flows In without ever having to raise taxes

273
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:44,255
Bruce's law said that some of it had to be sent back to

274
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,095
Like the state of Colorado actually had to send refund checks

275
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
Everyone in the state

276
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
Even the TV reporters at the time seemed

277
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
How would you like

278
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,751
$54

279
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
What would you do with it

280
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,847
Buy some books

281
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
In park

282
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
Because Colorado's economy is booming

283
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,735
The state treasury is overflowing with money

284
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
You are mine

285
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,831
And it's coming back

286
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,671
Dream right everything seems sweet with the taxpayers Bill of Rights

287
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:19,327
Until April 14th 2018 Black Friday there

288
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,119
Dotcom Bubble Burst

289
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,727
Everything came crashing down not just in Colorado but across the country

290
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
It was the worst

291
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,871
Single-day Point loss ever for both exchanges Colorado

292
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
Tax revenues plug

293
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,039
And the state was about to discover how the taxpayers Bill of Rights was really designed to work

294
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,343
After the break

295
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,951

Supposed to

Tax revenues first state

304
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
Go up and down depending on the economy

305
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,343
What brings in more money and

306
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Spend it

307
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,671
During recession the state brings in less

308
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Shmoney and

309
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Cut services

310
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Goes up and down

311
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
Texas Bill of Rights

312
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Is a sort of

313
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,071
One way

314
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,423
In Colorado if tax revenues go down one year

315
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,751
That becomes a new Baseline for the state

316
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,311
When the recession is over

317
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
And more money starts to come into Colorado

318
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
State is not allowed

319
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,967
Keep it

320
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
Close government shrunk during the recession

321
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
And now it was

322
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Locked

323
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
In the shrunken

324
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
State

325
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,135
Douglas Bruce

326
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
I thought of everything

327
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
He said it was all by Design

328
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
There are no unintended

329
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
None

330
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Zip zero

331
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
I knew what I was doing and

332
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:03,519
And I don't regret anything it's in there I wish I could have put in more but I had to make it calculated decision is but

333
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,079
What we get 51% of the vote

334
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,871
Colorado can always ask voters

335
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Increase

336
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,479
But even that has been anticipated by Douglas Bruce you couldn't

337
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
Just go to voters and say

338
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
Hey everyone we really need

339
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
No

340
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
You actually

341
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
Start the ballot measure

342
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
With these precise words

343
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Charles taxes

344
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,047
Be increased by

345
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
X millions of dollars

346
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Or billions

347
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,215
I mean Douglas Bruce knew that that kind of language does not encourage pee

348
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
People to vote Yes

349
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,079
After the 2001 recession Colorado was

350
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:45,247
Chris Castilian was working in the Colorado governor's office and he says they were looking at having to Splash higher education

351
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
And health

352
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,319
Our budget director of the time Houston

353
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
How is

354
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
Command and say

355
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:56,511
You know we're at the point of basically kicking old people out of nursing homes and so what do you want to do in order for us to meet the

356
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Requirements

357
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
What taper is imposing on

358
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:03,679
So they decided they had to change Tabor the taxpayers Bill of Rights

359
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
They had to go back to voters who

360
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Passed it

361
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
And essentially

362
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,591
Beg for them to loosen some of the rules

363
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:14,943
Douglas Bruce of course was like wait wait wait a minute you can't just go and find some

364
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
Work around 4

365
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Freedom

366
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
Colorado voters disagreed

367
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,903
They voted to loosen some of the restrictions that the taxpayers Bill of Rights

368
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,671
I put in

369
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,767
It was doing a fact but the state wouldn't have to kick old people out of nursing homes

370
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:29,791
Douglas Bruce

371
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:36,191
Was Furious he had all these ideas for new anti-tax measures

372
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,007
By this time people are starting to Tire of.

373
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
I was

374
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,871
Radioactive in certain circles young people say

375
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
Oh I hate Doug Bruce I love taper but I hate the group

376
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
Buster's had one

377
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
Last plan

378
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,135
He got himself temporarily appointed to a seat in the Colorado State ledge

379
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,207
He was going to take this anti-tax fight

380
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,767
All the way to the state capitol

381
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
And inside

382
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,887
Bruce is not a man who's built for politics

383
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:10,495
On one of his first days in office at the state capitol during the morning prayer

384
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,591
A bunch of photographers were gathered around him taking pictures like they're kneeling at a

385
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
And Bruce

386
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:23,295
Pushes one of them with his foot like he knocked the camera out of his hands

387
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,927
We're still maintains it was more of a nudge than a

388
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Kik

389
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:36,095
Obviously this did not go over well just a sideshow he may be a freakshow self-righteous and

390
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,935
Arrogant the Colorado house called a vote to censure him

391
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
On the house floor

392
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,823
Douglas first give this rambling defense of himself

393
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,127
From 1939

394
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
It's called Mr Smith Goes to Washington

395
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
I think many of you have seen it

396
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,319
Even the other Republicans didn't buy it

397
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
Representing Bruce

398
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
You're not Jimmy Stewart

399
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,695
This is not a 1939 movie

400
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
This is today

401
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
Your actions were wrong

402
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,327
The center vote was 62

403
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:13,727
21 Couch Street became the first and so far only member of the state legislature to be censured

404
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,823
Something he said to this day that he is not embarrassed about

405
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
100 +

406
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
40 years

407
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Yes

408
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,015
Really

409
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Of course

410
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:32,415
I I considered it's a badge of honor because these people are so saturated with corrupt

411
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
They would do that both parties

412
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,023
Parties Republicans and Democrats

413
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,375
And eventually the Republicans ditched him they pick somebody else in the next primary

414
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
And like that

415
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
He was out of the legislature

416
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
Things got worse for

417
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:50,335
Remember that pocket Constitution that he always carries with him

418
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,639
Says I'm going to quote it verbatim

419
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
And that's guaranteed an article

420
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
One set up a charity

421
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
To among other things

422
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,319
Make sure the high school seniors

423
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
Had their very own tiny pocket-sized editions of the Constitution that they could carry with them to class

424
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,767
What is the state of Colorado

425
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,559
Bruce was using this charity

426
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,583
To avoid paint

427
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
In 2011

428
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
Colorado charge

429
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
The most famous

430
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,983
Tax cutter in State history

431
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
With tax

432
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,847
I ridiculed the government Siri calling it

433
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
Felony philanthropy

434
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,759
I still got forty thousand copies of pocket constitutions in my garage

435
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
Better

436
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
Interrupted in

437
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,111
Distributing

438
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:39,743
One Friday afternoon Bruce went to the post office in his hometown Colorado Springs

439
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
As he was leaving officers came up

440
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,095
And arrested him

441
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
Bruce talk to the reporter the courthouse on the David

442
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,847
But you could also do people like you with your activism there is nobody like

443
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
What kind of a question is that

444
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,271
This probably won't surprise you but Douglas Bruce

445
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
Used his trial to sort of

446
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,087
Rail against

447
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,135
The system to say everyone is out to get

448
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
But it backfire

449
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,207
The jury convicted.

450
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:14,559
Was Bruce Douglas Bruce ended up in the Delta Correctional Center in western Colorado

451
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
State Prison

452
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,447
Oprah's is locked up the state continue to try to chip away at the tok

453
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Paris Bill of Rights

454
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
There's even a name for this

455
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,079
Call D bruising

456
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:29,151
One of the things that the state did was to raise

457
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
Fees instead of taxes

458
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,479
You don't need a vote to raise

459
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
Safi undertale

460
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,575
But the taxpayers Bill of Rights is still in effect

461
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
And it has

462
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
Real Empire

463
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:45,023
Funding for Colorado schools is among the lowest in the country despite a booming economy here

464
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
And Colorado has some of the worst roads in the country

465
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,143
In July 2016

466
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Douglas Bruce wenzhou

467
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
The parole board and asked to be let out of

468
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,823
Except responsibility for all my actions

469
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
I deeply regret them

470
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:03,711
It will never happen and accept responsibility for all my actions

471
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
I deeply regret them

472
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
It will never happen again

473
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,807
Those are true statement

474
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,879
That doesn't mean that I did anything wrong

475
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,487
I regret the fact that they sent me to prison

476
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Any

477
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
Intelligent person would regret that

478
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
Miss Abruzzo

479
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,399
I read your statement I've heard your statements

480
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
I've reviewed your file

481
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
You're doing well

482
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,543
Feel very good about the fact that we will never see you again

483
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,103
That concludes is here and good luck to you sir

484
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,943
Douglas Bruce went back to his home in Colorado Springs

485
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:40,319
He doesn't show up at the state capitol much anymore he doesn't have any big tax limit measures but

486
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
He does filing lawsuit

487
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
Against

488
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,183
Local governments in particular that

489
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
He thinks are violating the

490
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
Paris Bill of Rights he still fighting

491
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
To defend this law

492
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,887
In fact the voters of Colorado

493
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
They changed the rules

494
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:00,799
Sprint putting initiatives on the ballot they make sure that something big like a taxpayers Bill of Rights

495
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,079
Could never again be passed

496
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:02,847
Colorado

497
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:09,247
Dennis Bruce hasn't totally gone away though I mean you can still see him at his home town city council hearings when are

498
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:15,647
Never anything to do with taper comes up

499
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
Regular meeting

500
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,976
He's that guy at city council meeting

501
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:24,352
Waiting to speak two rows of chairs that are mostly empty

502
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,656
I've lived here for over 30 years

503
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,776
And what this council did with one dissenting vote

504
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
Last April 20th

505
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,640
Was probably the most flagrant

506
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,736
Violation of law that I've seen in my 30 years here and that's

507
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Saying something

508
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,088
A flagrant violation of his law

509
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
Haber the taxpayers Bill of Rights

510
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,720
He handed out copies of it to every council member

511
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512

The indicator in fact
