1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:05,120
The financial crisis was the biggest economic event we will see in our life

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,424
At least let's hope it is

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,544
And it's not entirely over every day we are still dealing with the aftermath of it

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,104
And there are still so many

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,248
Questions that I have about why the financial crisis happened the ways in which he responded to it with the consequences still might be

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,344
There is only one person in the world

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,136
Really who can answer this why

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,672

The former chairman of the federal

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,840
When the whole economy

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:36,864
Was falling apart

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,424
Ben Bernanke was the man who had to steer the ship

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,472
His book the courage to act is out

17
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,752

21
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,952
Hello and welcome to Planet Money I've Stacey Vanek Smith today on the show

23
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,424
You ain't share a message from one of our sponsors State Farm

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,496

Go right

31
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,520
There's a question I have always wanted to ask Ben Bernanke

32
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:54,176
Deluxe Princeton to go to the Federal Reserve in 2002 work under then chairman Alan Greenspan and became the chairman

33
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
One of the FED himself in mm

34
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
At the height

35
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Of the housing

36
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,344
Bernanke was a really well-known scholar of the Great Depression

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
Affect his studies informed a lot of the ways in which

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
What you responded to the financial

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:05,952
Crisis

40
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
But there's something I've always wondered

41
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,584
You are scholar of the Great Depression

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Certainly very

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,192
In tune with the 17 like you were in the right place at the right time

44
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,984
Why didn't you see this coming

45
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,080
Well anyways to financial crisis was a standard

46
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,384
Financial Panic what do Financial Panic is

47
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
Is a situation where people

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
Lose confidence

49
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
Into the banking system or the financial system generally

50
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Start

51
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
Pulling out their deposits in the banking system

52
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
For example

53
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
That's a traditional

54
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
Problem in link run exactly

55
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
We thought

56
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
And I say we I mean basically everybody

57
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Thought

58
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
That

59
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
That wasn't going to happen again because

60
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
In particular

61
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
Bank deposits are insured

62
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,128
And so people don't have any inside up to go run pull their money out of banks when I lose coughing

63
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
What's the banks

64
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
That was wrong

65
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
Went when things got bad enough

66
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,528
And prices of all assets were collapsing

67
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
And

68
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
Nobody wanted to hold even very

69
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Safe

70
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:08,928
Assets

71
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
Other than most safe

72
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
Then a tweet we had runs

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
And they were again

74
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
Conceptually very similar

75
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
2

76
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,704
The bank runs of the 19th century or the 1930s

77
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
But instead of it being people lining up

78
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
Take your deposit out of the bank's it was

79
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,336
Electronic run

80
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
So that the

81
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
The Panic phenomenon was very much part of this

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,224
And what's the panic.

83
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,760
Out of control then

84
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,040
Everybody is

85
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
Hunkering down or selling assets

86
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
As quickly as they can

87
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
And the financial system comes to the brink of

88
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Collapsible

89
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
We did understand that

90
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,816
There were problems of the subprime mortgage Market no sense of things that we did not see

91
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,376
Was that it could turn into a broad-based

92
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:54,496
Panic rev was losing confidence in financial system and trying to pull their money out as fast as possible

93
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
We didn't see that coming

94
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,896
There was always this mystery around why the banks were bailed out rather than the home

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
Why was it the right move to bailout the banks

96
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
AR View

97
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Was that

98
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,368
You know that potential system collapses the economy collapses

99
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
And we needed to stabilize the banks in order to get

100
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
The system

101
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,815
Natural system stable and then that would lead us to a situation we can help the economy recover

102
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
Saint that was true

103
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,655
At least we know once the crisis

104
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,703
Began once we get in to see the

105
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,031
Problems emerging least we had a strategy in the strategy was

106
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Central banks

107
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,407
For 300 years have been the so-called lender-of-last-resort there there

108
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Provide

109
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Liquidity

110
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,575
Try to help stabilize a financial system that's what the Fed was set up for 1913 what's the stabilizers natural

111
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
We felt that

112
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,183
It wasn't a question of bailing them out because we cared about

113
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
Wall Street executives

114
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
And I was an academic I came from

115
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
Small town in South Carolina never worked on Wall Street

116
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,679
But I knew enough about economic history to know that a financial collapse is going to lead to an economic collapse and we had to do

117
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
What are we had to do

118
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
The stop that

119
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
So that was that was critical

120
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,823
But actually

121
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,919
Could work in done probably but actually the resistance to it came mostly from Congress

122
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,503
The origins of the Tea Party supposedly came from

123
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,831
Opposition not to be I had the banks but opposition to bailing out

124
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
So-called profligate

125
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
Borrowers

126
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,487
Yeah people who taking irresponsibly together

127
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,559
It was actually became popular and and Congress

128
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,679
Put a lot of restrictions on what the treasury could do and I know it's certainly not the case that Treasury

129
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
Ignored homeowners they tried very hard

130
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,543
And every time I could go

131
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
Whatever reason to the White House

132
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,431
Did that time President Obama say what are we doing for all Motors had to do it was just a

133
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
A tough challenge quickly again

134
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,295
Since Congress I put the significant limitations on how

135
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Money could be used

136
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
How bad could it have gotten

137
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
That was something I always want

138
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,207
Well it's hard to know

139
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
But

140
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
Council economic advisers in the in the White House

141
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,631
Did an analysis of the behavior of the US economy

142
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:03,007
In the months after leaving brothers and compared it to the 1929-1932 1931

143
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
And in 2008 was worse

144
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,383
I said

145
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Meaningfully worse

146
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
The Nike 29 in terms of

147
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
Declining

148
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,783
Employment declining

149
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
Industrial production and so on

150
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,463
So it's hard to know and I can say well suppose it was only a 25% chance

151
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
Another Great Depression would you have acted then

152
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,327
I think I think there's a case that even if you weren't certain.

153
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
If you wanted to avoid

154
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
That risk

155
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
But

156
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,239
To be honest with you I mean I was one of the people

157
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
When I went to Congress

158
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
In the fall 2018 said look we got to do something

159
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Because

160
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,991
If we could just natural system collapses the rest of the economy is going to come down with it

161
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
I was one of the people who was

162
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
Most pessimistic about what

163
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
The effects might be on

164
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
The US economy

165
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,183
I was not pessimistic enough

166
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,767
It felt the economy collapse even more quickly than I was fearing it

167
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
And end

168
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,583
Their response was really dramatic

169
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,375
So I mean I remember when the

170
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Dow Jones

171
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
6000

172
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,495
I remember at one point the thought going through my mind like

173
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
The market connection

174
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
She go to zero

175
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,871
They lost 6000 points there only 6000 points left

176
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
And I I remember

177
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Feeling like it was such a

178
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,783
Such a kind of dark really frightening time

179
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,063
Is it really sort of felt like things were

180
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Falling apart

181
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
What was

182
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,135
Like

183
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,927
For you during that time just like

184
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,511
Getting up every morning and it was a very scary time

185
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,351
The stock market wasn't going to go to zero it didn't go to zero even in the Great Depression

186
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,447
That's true for a while

187
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,239
But the economy was was

188
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,543
In free-fall as I mentioned and

189
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
The who knew what the bottom was was that

190
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
But

191
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199
Once we had a plan we had a general strategy my

192
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,015
My focus was only psychologically my focus was

193
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,087
What do I have to do today what what do we have to accomplish today

194
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
What are the next steps

195
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
Biblical one day at a time

196
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,743
Strategy if I tried looking ahead too far it was

197
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Too much uncertainty

198
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
But you know it

199
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,399
Really taking it one step at a time to get us back to

200
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
More stable

201
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Situation

202
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,983
Did you stick to your

203
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Normal routine then or did you

204
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,847
Well there's some periods during to physically during the hives

205
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
The crisis when I would

206
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Sleep on my sofa

207
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
My office

208
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,527
No there's some weekends where we were dealing with

209
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
A big firm that was

210
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
In serious trouble in

211
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,159
It would be conference calls all night in

212
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
Trying to figure out

213
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
And what we could do and

214
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
We only had so many hours

215
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
Deb

216
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,583
What did you eat

217
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,631
Set the time a lot of junk

218
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,935
Don't be so kind of thing you know but

219
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:43,775
Yeah I know I mean I remember just at that time feeling like the whole country was kind of

220
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Looking at you

221
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823
You were like the

222
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
Countries therapist for a

223
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
But there was

224
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
Also a lot of dramatic

225
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,599
The drama it was not entirely without purpose

226
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
Part of the psychological and you want to get people

227
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
More confident than

228
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
And they want

229
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,047
Believe that the FED is taking action needed to get

230
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,839
Connie back on track

231
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,935
So I can get part was important to and like the theater of it

232
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,215
There was some theater to it

233
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
I would said that

234
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
Central Banking monetary policy is

235
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,615
90% talking 2% tax

236
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:23,455
Like 90% of the job is that a lot of it is that true

237
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,015
A lot of it is a lot of it is a lot of it is about

238
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:32,927
Convincing people that you'll do what you say you're going to do and that you will take whatever steps are necessary to ask about what

239
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
With all the Senate

240
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
A testimony that you had to give

241
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
One of the

242
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,423
Lines of questioning that I remembered that stuck out of my head was from Ron Paul I pulled the clip if you don't mind we can just play it

243
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
And histories against

244
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,775
I mean history is on the side hard money

245
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
If you look at it

246
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:54,431
Stable prices you have to look to the only historic sound money that's lasted more than a few years

247
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
Fiat money always in

248
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,063
Gold is the only thing where you can stable prices

249
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:05,439
Now you're correct that there are relationships obviously between the dollar and domestic inflation

250
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,511
In a relationship between the money supply and domestic inflation

251
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,303
But those are not perfect relationship

252
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
They're not exact relationships and

253
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Given a choice we have to look at the

254
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:19,775
Inflation rate domestic inflation rate now I understand that you would like to see a gold standard for example but

255
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
Is really something for Congress

256
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
Who sings paint

257
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
They were fairly painful

258
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,199
For both good and bad reasons

259
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,991
The bad reasons why they think there was

260
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
Some unwarranted

261
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,831
Antagonism in part at least some members of

262
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,367
Congress of

263
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
But on the other hand

264
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
It was also the case that

265
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,511
You know people were very concerned about what was happening what was

266
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,559
What was happening to the economy what was happening

267
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,607
What the Fed was doing and it was my job

268
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,167
It wasn't always most Pleasant thing in the world but baby

269
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
Important part of my job.

270
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Explain

271
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
Two members of Congress and

272
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
Through them to the publican

273
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Media and the

274
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Markets

275
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,943
What we're doing while we're doing it and how we saw things unfolding

276
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,527
I testified before you the house or the Senate something like 80 times

277
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
Oh my gosh

278
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,623
I had to try to remain common and certainly

279
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Part of the

280
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
Job is

281
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
The project

282
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,279
Make people feel more confident about what you're trying to do

283
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,559
So

284
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
We would

285
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
First it would always be a written test

286
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
Which was sort of layout

287
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
The main points I want

288
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
Macon so that had to be written and

289
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
Consultation with staff

290
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:30,175
Bloody Disgusting about every word that goes into those because you guys have a meeting that goes for half a day over

291
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,967
The word predominantly

292
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,575
Is that right one word

293
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Often

294
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,391
Sweat

295
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
The details in terms of

296
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,487
Which word are using because Marcus would say okay

297
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:50,143
They said the economy is growing moderately rather than modestly that must mean x y and z

298
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,983
So it was important to try to get to

299
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,799
Wording as accurate as possible and

300
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:57,823
You know

301
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
People say that the FED speeches can be kind of

302
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
Stephen

303
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
Encounter formulaic and there's a reason for that

304
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,783
Yeah but this communication going on in terms of

305
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
Exactly how the

306
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Issues are laid out in

307
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
X words for using someone

308
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
I remember at one point you

309
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
Say that you're in a meeting at the fed and you sort of offhandedly

310
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
Ask almost a rhetorical question and

311
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,167
I think later in the day you get like a presentation with the bibliography and everything answering your

312
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,239
This was before I was Jeremy this is when I was just a governor on the board

313
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
And I

314
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
There was a

315
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,103
Presentation by the staff

316
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
And I was used to being an academic

317
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:38,271
Before that an engine to cause trouble

318
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,343
And so I post a hypothetical question I didn't realize it

319
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
Did the FED staff

320
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,743
Actually answering the question after that I try to be much more careful in

321
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,351
When I post a hypothetical good training for being there

322
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
Like every single thing you say

323
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
Market moving

324
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
We're at all so it also is

325
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
Everyone is a real

326
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Privileges

327
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
Fed chairman or on the Fit board

328
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,663
Is it the staff are so strong

329
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,247
I had what what I came there the FED in 2002 for Direct

330
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Princeton I had about 10

331
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
Former students

332
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:18,975
On the stand really and so their lot of folks there who I knew and already gotten a bad grade

333
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,535
No no not those people

334
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,863
Is the Fed less powerful than everybody thinks

335
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
When is it

336
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
I think it is I mean

337
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
So

338
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Monetary policy is a powerful tool

339
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
But it can only do certain things

340
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
You know for example

341
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,271
People are concerned in the US economy today about slow productivity growth

342
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,063
They're concerned that the distribution of income

343
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,927
The concerned about the fact that participation rates among

344
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,255
Prime age workers are are lower here than other country

345
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,815
A lot of real problems in our economy

346
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
End the Fed

347
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:00,191
With this one tool monetary policy and I really can't address those kinds of

348
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
So

349
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,103
For a lot of the issues that would be too although I mean well it but it would have basically Hindu

350
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
First decan

351
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
Try to keep inflation close to the fed's Target which is

352
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,479
They've been pretty successful in doing

353
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:18,111
What about the target inflation rate cuz I know you were trying to hit 2% and and

354
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
During your term you weren't able to hit it

355
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,207
That always confused me why

356
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
Why weren't you able to hit it

357
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,303
It seems like you had all the all the tools

358
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
The reason is that

359
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
The main way in which the Fed

360
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
Effects inflation released

361
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
What are the main ways

362
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,543
Is by getting the economy at the Full Employment so that the pressure on

363
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,383
Labor markets in the economy tends to give extra impetus to wages and prices

364
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
That's the mechanism

365
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:47,295
So the FED in order to get inflation where once it is basically had to get the economy back

366
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
To wear watch

367
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
And that that's what's happening now we seeing

368
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
The labor market

369
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
Close to full employment with starting to see some upward pressure on wages

370
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
Inflation is

371
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
Rising very slowly

372
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
Very much in a controlled way

373
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
But it is now a meal

374
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
Moving very slowly towards the

375
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
The 2% Target.

376
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,823
Is there anything that you kind of keep your eye on now something that you watch carefully

377
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
As an economic indicator

378
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
Directions

379
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:18,271
My predecessor Alan Greenspan who stood watch all kinds of interesting

380
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
Obscure indicators

381
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
Oh really yeah

382
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:26,207
Apparently he would look at men's underwear sales on the grounds

383
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
On the ground

384
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,559
People don't buy new underwear when they're feeling economically strapped

385
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
So

386
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,911
Things like that

387
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:38,239
Maybe true I don't I can't verify

388
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,567
But I'm working ventralight

389
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,359
I no longer have

390
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,127
All the

391
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Cats after

392
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
To help me anymore so I'm

393
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,711
More like a civilian

394
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:52,575
Now when you pose rhetorical question it just hangs out there

395
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:57,439
When you were in maybe the toughest position during one of the toughest points in the US economy

396
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
Is there anything that you

397
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
Miss about that time

398
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,351
Well I am no longer the fat of course

399
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
And

400
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
I enjoyed

401
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,215
Many things about the fat a lot of great people

402
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
I was really interesting to have

403
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,591
So many smart Economist around who can help me think about

404
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
Economic issues

405
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,455
But I surely wouldn't want to be in that kind of situation again

406
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
Particularly

407
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
So much uncertainty in

408
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
All the political blowback and we were getting so

409
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,671
I'm happy to be a civilian I'm happy to be

410
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
On the outside looking in

411
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
