EDL	00:01:16,773	00:01:21,176	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON ADLER: I’m Simon Adler.
EDL	00:01:21,199	00:01:24,590	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD ABUMRAD: And I’m Jad Abumrad. This is Radiolab.
EDL	00:01:24,590	00:01:29,312	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Truth be told, I don’t know if this is the way to start, but let’s just jump in, I guess.
EDL	00:01:29,327	00:01:30,790	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: Yeah, take her for a spin.
EDL	00:01:30,810	00:01:41,701	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Alright. So, I’ve got a short story for you about a piece of technology that we don’t think about much today, and how one morning it tore a small hole in the space time continuum.
EDL	00:01:41,722	00:01:42,219	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: Mmm.
EDL	00:01:42,234	00:01:50,920	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	NORIKO ISHIGAKI: According to the memoir... [speaking Japanese]
EDL	00:01:50,932	00:01:52,146	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: This is Noriko Ishigaki.; 1.21s
EDL	00:01:52,164	00:01:54,767	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And who’s —memoir are you reading from there?
EDL	00:01:54,767	00:01:56,081	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	NORIKO ISHIGAKI: Yasuo Kuroki.
EDL	00:01:56,100	00:01:56,899	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Okay.
EDL	00:01:56,900	00:02:06,594	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: She is an Japanese-English translator as well as a long time friend. And she says that on the morning of June 22, 1979 in Yoyogi Park…
EDL	00:02:06,596	00:02:13,291	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	NORIKO ISHIGAKI: One of the biggest parks in Tokyo, magazine reporters and editors are gathered.
EDL	00:02:13,316	00:02:19,935	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Maybe a dozen or so, alongside some—press people from the Sony Corporation.
EDL	00:02:19,961	00:02:20,769	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: Okay.
EDL	00:02:20,793	00:02:26,589	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And Sony has gathered this gaggle of journalists there to sort of unveil this new product for them.
EDL	00:02:26,617	00:02:28,292	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	NORIKO ISHIGAKI: Our product called Walkman.
EDL	00:02:28,313	00:02:29,840	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: The Sony Walkman.
EDL	00:02:29,860	00:02:30,745	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: Oh, yes.
EDL	00:02:30,767	00:02:37,389	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Now these reporters had very little idea what exactly to expect or even what this Walkman was.
EDL	00:02:37,412	00:02:43,127	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	NORIKO ISHIGAKI: And the product leader carefully hands each reporter a Walkman.
EDL	00:02:43,151	00:02:46,109	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: With a cassette in—inside it already.
EDL	00:02:46,127	00:02:46,822	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: Okay.
EDL	00:02:46,841	00:02:48,360	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Did you have a Walkman, Jad?
EDL	00:02:48,377	00:02:53,828	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: Oh my god, yes! It was blue, steel. None of this plastic shit.
EDL	00:02:53,828	00:02:54,743	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: [laugh]
EDL	00:02:54,767	00:03:04,399	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: Yes, I remember the way you would put the cassette in and then click it shut and there was something about that tactile sound—yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
EDL	00:03:04,420	00:03:07,794	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Anyhow, so these reporters put on these orange headphones…
EDL	00:03:07,812	00:03:14,694	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	NORIKO ISHIGAKI: And then the event organizer says, “Please press the play button. One, two, three, go!”
EDL	00:03:14,713	00:03:17,753	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And…
EDL	00:03:17,753	00:03:22,360	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	NORIKO ISHIGAKI: Ooh.
EDL	00:03:24,471	00:03:27,919	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: The sound blasting into their ears and…
EDL	00:03:27,919	00:03:30,265	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Speaker 1: [speaking Japanese]]
EDL	00:03:30,287	00:03:32,315	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: This voice welcoming them...
EDL	00:03:32,335	00:03:36,831	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Speaker 1: [speaking Japanese]]; 4.50s
EDL	00:03:36,846	00:03:38,631	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And the voice says to them…
EDL	00:03:38,649	00:03:41,721	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Speaker 1: [speaking Japanese]]
EDL	00:03:41,721	00:03:43,469	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Look out into the park.
EDL	00:03:43,492	00:03:45,454	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Speaker 1: [speaking Japanese]]; 1.96s
EDL	00:03:45,454	00:04:00,565	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And they see that they are not the only ones listening to a Walkman. There are dozens of other folks with orange headphones on moving through the park. Kids are roller skates...
EDL	00:04:00,580	00:04:05,352	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	NORIKO ISHIGAKI: College students jogging, a woman exercising.
EDL	00:04:05,369	00:04:22,446	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: People skateboarding, even a buddhist monk. Like the scene that you and I see everyday walking down the streets, you know, people in their own little world listening to whatever they want to…
EDL	00:04:22,424	00:04:23,106	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: Yeah.
EDL	00:04:23,106	00:04:25,954	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: This is the first time anyone had ever seen that. 
EDL	00:04:25,954	00:04:28,482	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: Amazing. Amazing.
EDL	00:04:28,482	00:05:06,512	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And of course, if they took their headphones off, they rejoin our shared world hearing the din of the park and the city around them. But then when they put them back on, they’d be back in their own little world. Headphones off, collective reality. Headphones on, whatever personal reality, whatever mood they’ve chosen for themselves.
EDL	00:05:10,545	00:05:11,173	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: Oh my god.
EDL	00:05:11,192	00:05:37,996	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Totally, yeah. And maybe you can communicate this better than me because you’ve lived it, but like this was all so new. Like most of these people had probably never worn headphones before. They’ve never had stuff pumped directly into their ears. They’ve never listened to something outside before, short of transistor radio or maybe a boombox. And they’re now doing it altogether, but by themselves.
EDL	00:05:38,018	00:05:45,368	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: People don’t really understand what—a big deal the Walkman was. Like, remember when Steve Jobs did the iPhone and everybody’s like, “Oh my god, oh my god.”
EDL	00:05:45,368	00:05:46,181	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Yep, yep.
EDL	00:05:46,200	00:05:48,632	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: This was like that, times 1,000.
EDL	00:05:48,632	00:05:49,711	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: You’d go that far?
EDL	00:05:49,710	00:06:05,702	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: No, really. To go from a world where you had to sit on your ass and listen to music in a specific place to suddenly you could walk, like literally walk and have the music playing just for you, thereby soundtracking your journey.
EDL	00:06:05,721	00:06:07,140	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: [laugh]
EDL	00:06:07,161	00:06:14,116	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: You know? I was like, this is a movie and I am the protagonist. This is amazing. Like, it was—it was amazing.
EDL	00:06:15,220	00:06:35,225	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Well, as amazing and liberating as it was, it was also controversial. Almost immediately, folks were hollering that this personalized silo, intimate consumption of media was going to end communities, if not society as we knew it.
EDL	00:06:35,224	00:06:40,594	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: It’s like—the same conversations we’re having now about Twitter and Facebook.
EDL	00:06:40,611	00:06:52,654	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Oh yeah. And so, I don’t know, in more ways than one, I think what Sony unintentionally gave those reporters that morning was a glimpse into the future.
EDL	00:07:04,056	00:07:19,489	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Akio Morita: I don’t know if it was good for the people or bad for the people, but at least we gave people some joy or enjoyment in music.]
EDL	00:07:23,737	00:08:24,440	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Now, I’ve spent the last year listening to, thinking about, and researching the object powering those Sony Walkmans—the cassette tape. And what I learned is that this object, this little piece of plastic changed the world. It brought down governments, collapsed space and time, and remade how we say those three simple words—I love you. So, for the next five weeks, I’ve got a mixtape of stories for you, a mixtape that will take us to China, Vietnam, South Sudan, Czechoslovakia, 1940s America, exploring this object’s impact and how, believe it or not—we’re still really living in a cassette world. I’m Simon Adler and this is Mixtape.
EDL	00:08:32,493	00:08:38,658	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	JAD: Okay, well Simon, why don’t you just take it from here? I’ll just excuse myself, go listen to my Walkman in the kitchen.
EDL	00:08:38,658	00:08:42,690	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Alright then, so—here we go.
EDL	00:08:44,016	00:08:44,634	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Speaker 1: Hot licks!]

EDL	00:08:54,750	00:08:55,221	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Speaker 2: Blah blah blah ]      
EDL	00:08:55,832	00:08:58,955	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Speaker 3: As you see you feel more and more freedom, freedom…]

EDL	00:10:01,884	00:10:10,262	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: I mean, the best source of reading material he had was at that time, people would use old newspaper as wallpaper.

EDL	00:10:23,926	00:10:32,652	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: But while Hao was hungry for any information about the outside world, his real love was—music.

EDL	00:11:18,528	00:11:24,928	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Corrupt businessmen. And in them, the peasants seem to always win and the capitalists got what they deserved.

EDL	00:11:29,696	00:11:32,854	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And I mean, Hao loved this stuff.
EDL	00:11:32,875	00:11:35,008	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	HAO FANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:11:35,008	00:11:40,476	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: I remember watching my mom sing, and I would join, it was simply something that made me happy. 
EDL	00:11:40,502	00:11:43,870	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: But there was very little for him to listen to.
EDL	00:11:43,894	00:11:58,623	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: Because actually these revolutionary operas, they were the only officially sanctioned style of music. And nationwide there—were only eight that are—that people could listen to, so…
EDL	00:11:58,624	00:12:01,600	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: There were only eight operas?! That was the off—
EDL	00:12:01,600	00:12:02,595	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: Yeah, yeah. Eight.
EDL	00:12:02,614	00:12:07,533	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Eight operas. Everything else was illegal. 
EDL	00:12:07,552	00:12:17,599	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Does that mean if I turned on the radio in China in, let’s say 1974, I would be hearing one of those operas being played?
EDL	00:12:17,622	00:12:30,786	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: The answer is yes, but then, back in those years, it’s not that common for a person to turn on the radio. It’s more about loudspeakers, which was, I guess, the most common way to listen to music.
EDL	00:12:30,806	00:12:37,696	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: So you don’t even tune into them, they’re blasted to you through loudspeakers
EDL	00:12:37,696	00:12:38,481	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: Mm-hmm.

EDL	00:12:45,024	00:12:58,676	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And for Hao, it pretty much stayed that way for years. And years, and years. But then—a decade or so later...

EDL	00:13:24,267	00:13:31,719	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: Hao just graduated from college, and he went to Wuhan. Wuhan, the—where the virus started. 
EDL	00:13:31,744	00:13:36,043	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: During the day, Hao would venture out into Wuhan to explore his new home.

EDL	00:13:37,952	00:13:42,560	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: So, he was just like wandering the city looking for stuff to do with his roommates.
EDL	00:13:42,582	00:13:44,090	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	HAO FANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:13:44,107	00:13:48,918	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: And they just happen to stumble across this theater-like place.
EDL	00:13:48,918	00:13:53,334	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: A little hole-in-the-wall showing bootleg movies with a curtain for a door.

EDL	00:13:55,069	00:13:59,140	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: He opened the curtain and walked in and…
EDL	00:13:59,147	00:14:11,507	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: There were a dozen or so people there, small illuminated screen up at the front. He had to sort of squint through all of the cigarette smoke—to really make out the screen. 
EDL	00:14:11,531	00:14:15,522	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: But the first thing he noticed was the smell.
EDL	00:14:15,542	00:14:17,227	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And not just from the cigarettes.

EDL	00:14:33,473	00:14:35,371	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Anyhow, the movie they were showing was….
EDL	00:14:35,371	00:14:40,693	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	HAO FANG: Bah bah bah bah bah bah...
EDL	00:14:40,715	00:14:43,734	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: An illegal bootleg copy of Apocalypse Now.

EDL	00:14:48,502	00:14:52,075	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And he’d never seen anything like it.

EDL	00:14:53,131	00:14:58,597	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: The realism. The violence. The explosive budget.

EDL	00:15:00,790	00:15:08,401	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: But what hit him hardest was not those smells or those images on the screen. But what was coming out of the speakers. 
EDL	00:15:08,427	00:15:10,824	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	HAO FANG: The Doors.

EDL	00:15:50,941	00:16:03,090	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: And so yeah, Hao was just totally—touched by the—music.
EDL	00:16:03,090	00:16:20,765	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: He’d never heard such a simple yet powerful arrangement. Basically, never heard a song about death. Never imagined music could be so emotionally complicated and layered.

EDL	00:16:26,440	00:16:30,354	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: Love at the first sight, really. 
EDL	00:16:30,354	00:16:34,013	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And he needed more of it. But...
EDL	00:16:34,013	00:16:36,148	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	HAO FANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:16:36,168	00:16:37,679	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: There was nothing. Nothing at all.
EDL	00:16:37,704	00:16:53,480	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: I mean, China was opening up a bit at the time, letting some western music in. But there was an actual committee that would hand pick which songs and what they were letting in, like John Denver, the Carpenters...
EDL	00:16:53,480	00:16:54,753	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	HAO FANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:16:54,770	00:17:00,760	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: Yeah. Very limited songs. Only really, really popular stuff.
EDL	00:17:00,776	00:17:18,127	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: It was pretty harmless. And as for more complicated, subversive music coming out of the west at the time—like no one had legal access to it. But there was a group of people in China who, like Hao, had gotten, at least, a little taste of that larger musical world.
EDL	00:17:18,152	00:17:20,110	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: University Students.
EDL	00:17:20,136	00:17:27,250	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Right, right, right. Students at the university. They were some of the few people who had connections to the foreign community. 
EDL	00:17:27,272	00:17:28,737	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: This is Kaiser Kuo.
EDL	00:17:28,754	00:17:33,055	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: I am a podcaster. I run the Sinica Podcast on SupChina.
EDL	00:17:33,074	00:17:39,326	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: He’s also a musician, was born to Chinese immigrant parents and came of age in Tucson, Arizona. 
EDL	00:17:39,346	00:17:45,934	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Which is why I talk the way I do. Everyone thinks I sound like I’m from Southern California or something, but it’s—the Tuscan in me.
EDL	00:17:45,960	00:17:59,567	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And he was living and studying in China in the late 80s, and he says exchange students like him, English teachers were giving some of this music to these students and they were beginning to express themselves through it.

EDL	00:18:16,931	00:18:19,481	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Kaiser actually attended these protests.
EDL	00:18:19,481	00:18:22,436	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: And so, you know, students had taken over the entire center of the city.

EDL	00:18:27,982	00:18:46,852	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: These students in Beijing were demanding democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of access to the outside world. But also Kaiser told me they were doing this thing that didn’t get talked about much. He said that right there in the heart of the demonstrations...
EDL	00:18:46,873	00:18:55,233	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: People would just sort of set up stacks of PA and then they’d have, you know, all the bands at the time, just playing, you know, long into the night.

EDL	00:19:20,548	00:19:32,451	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Right, right. We don’t talk about the seven weeks of just love and anarchy. It was wonderful. [laugh]. Some of the happiest days I could remember.

EDL	00:23:01,276	00:23:12,946	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: But just a few short years later, the outside came flooding in. In pretty much the most unexpected way I can think of.

Before we went to break, after decades of communist party operas, sprinkled only with the occasional John Denver song, Hao Fang had stumbled upon a trove of cassettes filled with music that neither he nor, pretty much, anyone else in China had ever had a chance to hear before. And the thing is, he wasn’t alone.
EDL	00:29:26,687	00:29:29,243	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	WENHUA SHI: I mean rows and rows and rows of tapes.

EDL	00:29:58,811	00:30:03,986	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: And people have been, you know, telling me about this person who they call Professor Ye.
EDL	00:30:03,986	00:30:05,339	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Professor Ye?
EDL	00:30:05,339	00:30:08,059	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: Yeah. So, Ye Lao Shi. Ye.

EDL	00:30:15,320	00:30:21,748	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And while we couldn't 100 percent confirm that he was the first guy, he was certainly one of the first.
EDL	00:30:21,748	00:30:38,621	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: So, this is, I guess, the most common version of the story, so Ye Lao Shi, he used to be a professor or at least a lecturer at the Shantou  University located in Southeast China and in the early 1990s...
EDL	00:30:38,621	00:30:41,853	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Professor Ye took a trip to this nearby town of Heping.
EDL	00:30:41,853	00:30:45,565	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: Tiny, tiny sort of village in a way, you know?
EDL	00:30:45,565	00:30:47,635	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Maybe to do some research, maybe on vacation.
EDL	00:30:47,635	00:30:50,792	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: I don’t know why exactly, but somehow he was there.
EDL	00:30:50,792	00:30:57,107	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And he got a tip that he should go check out this giant warehouse. It was actually a recycling center.
EDL	00:30:57,107	00:30:58,813	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: What we call liu cheng.
EDL	00:30:58,813	00:31:16,413	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: At that time, China was buying up and importing much of the world's recycling. And this town and warehouse was processing all of the plastics. And looking around at all this plastic waiting to be ground up into little, tiny pellets, he realized...
EDL	00:31:16,413	00:31:19,528	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: He was standing in a mountain of cassette tapes.
EDL	00:31:19,528	00:31:35,287	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: I mean, to the left of him, a pile 5 feet high. To the right, a mound of them 10 feet high. There were thousands and thousands of cassettes, each with a cut into it.
EDL	00:31:35,287	00:31:57,907	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: I mean, of course he would be astonished. Imagining what kind of sounds are in there, thinking, "Who is this band? Who is this singer?" And he would be dying to hear the music in it. Yeah. The point is that those cassettes came in as plastic scrap and they came in tons.

EDL	00:32:10,489	00:32:15,443	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: This again is Hao Fang, who years later took his own trip to Heping to see it.
EDL	00:32:15,443	00:32:18,088	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	HAO FANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:32:18,088	00:32:20,478	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: You couldn't possibly count how many cassettes there were.
EDL	00:32:20,478	00:32:23,763	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: Millions and millions of tapes, yeah.
EDL	00:32:23,763	00:32:32,082	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Ballpark estimates Mabu gave me, put it somewhere between 45 and 150 million of them each year.
EDL	00:32:36,834	00:32:38,005	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: I’m ready
EDL	00:32:38,005	00:32:41,005	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SPEAKER 8: So, Simon will give you a ring here in a minute
EDL	00:32:41,005	00:32:46,786	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: So, I’ll hear him coming through the phone, but I’m talking into the microphone, right?
EDL	00:32:46,786	00:32:48,000	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SPEAKER 8: That’s exactly right
EDL	00:32:48,000	00:32:48,789	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: Alright.
EDL	00:32:48,789	00:32:54,688	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Now, to figure out the origin of these millions and millions of garbage cassettes.
EDL	00:32:54,688	00:32:58,438	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: Hello
EDL	00:32:58,438	00:32:59,498	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: I gave this guy a call.
EDL	00:32:59,498	00:33:01,100	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Hello, is this Bill?
EDL	00:33:01,100	00:33:02,119	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: Yes, it is.
EDL	00:33:02,119	00:33:05,058	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Hey, Bill. Simon here from Radiolab, how are you?
EDL	00:33:05,058	00:33:06,701	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: I’m good Simon, how are you?
EDL	00:33:06,701	00:33:08,642	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: This is Bill Knoedelseder.
EDL	00:33:08,642	00:33:13,122	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: I covered the recording industry from 1982-1989.
EDL	00:33:13,122	00:33:20,909	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And he says, back here in the US, the late 80s and early 90s, were just a period of decadence in the music industry.
EDL	00:33:20,909	00:33:32,173	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: Oh yeah, oh my god. The record companies were the cash cows. If you were Warner Brothers, your record company was making more money and was more profitable than your—movie division.
EDL	00:33:32,173	00:33:37,742	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: They were flush with bands selling millions and millions of records like REM.
EDL	00:33:37,742	00:33:39,725	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Speaker 9: Went out to sell more than 3 million copies...]
EDL	00:33:39,725	00:33:40,538	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: U2.
EDL	00:33:40,538	00:33:43,824	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Speaker 10: The Joshua Tree selling well over 4 million copies.]
EDL	00:33:43,824	00:33:45,149	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Nirvana, Bon Jovi...
EDL	00:33:45,149	00:33:48,318	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, Speaker 11: Slippery When Wet sold over 12 million copies world wide.]
EDL	00:33:48,318	00:33:51,159	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: So, the money was enormous.
EDL	00:33:51,159	00:34:06,665	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And so record execs were making big bets, producing millions and millions of copies of just about everything they were releasing. Everything from Madonna to, I don’t know, probably even the animated rapping character MC Skat Kat.
EDL	00:34:06,665	00:34:13,419	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[ARCHIVE CLIP, MC SKAT KAT: Coming out strong, whenever there’s action, that’s where you’ll find me, Skat Kat’s the name in the 1990s!]
EDL	00:34:13,419	00:34:28,620	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: I mean, they were producing so many that even a hit record often left hundreds of thousands of unsold copies, let alone a flop like MC Skat Kat. And so, what did they do with this surplus?
EDL	00:34:28,620	00:34:37,324	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: They wanted to get rid of it. Okay? And so what they would do is they would sell them in bulk for pennies apiece to a network of buyers and resellers.
EDL	00:34:37,324	00:34:41,164	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: First, they’d end up in record stores, labelled as cut outs...
EDL	00:34:41,164	00:34:46,820	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: You know a discontinued record is called a cut out, because they’ve cut it out of their active sales category.
EDL	00:34:46,820	00:34:53,300	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: If they didn't sell there, someone would buy them in bulk for pennies on the dollar again, try to sell them somewhere else.
EDL	00:34:53,300	00:34:57,375	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: Truck stops, car washes, drugstores and whatever else.
EDL	00:34:57,375	00:35:00,233	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And finally if nobody wanted these cassettes...
EDL	00:35:00,233	00:35:02,356	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: They’d send it out to be destroyed.
EDL	00:35:02,356	00:35:16,885	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: The standard way they did this was to run a saw blade through them, cutting about an inch deep into the cassette itself, leaving a gash in the plastic and a break in the magnetic tape. And from there, unbeknownst even to Bill...
EDL	00:35:16,885	00:35:23,626	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: It’s getting there in garbage? In like big—fucking barges of trash, is that what you’re saying?
EDL	00:35:23,626	00:35:25,951	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Exac—barge, yes, scrap barges.
EDL	00:35:25,951	00:35:27,189	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: Wow.
EDL	00:35:27,189	00:35:36,938	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: These cut up cut outs were thrown into shipping containers and sent to China, where Professor Ye found them as these mountains of scrap.
EDL	00:35:36,938	00:35:43,594	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	BILL KNOEDELSEDER: I—take heart from this, the music will get to the people no matter what! [laugh] You know?
EDL	00:35:43,594	00:35:53,557	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: However, for this music to get to the people of China, these cassettes needed to be repaired. Which is what Professor Ye tried to do.
EDL	00:35:53,557	00:35:56,353	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Here's what we're gonna do. Bring the tools out here.
EDL	00:35:56,353	00:35:57,034	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: Okay.
EDL	00:35:57,034	00:35:59,272	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: His theory was, essentially…
EDL	00:35:59,272	00:36:02,272	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Even if the mechanism was damaged, you can take the tape out.
EDL	00:36:02,272	00:36:04,235	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Again, Kaiser Kuo.
EDL	00:36:04,235	00:36:07,029	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Splice it and rewind it onto a new cassette body.
EDL	00:36:07,029	00:36:12,256	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: It wasn’t going to be easy. In fact it was going to be a royal pain in the ass. 
EDL	00:36:12,256	00:36:13,664	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: Okay. Here we go.
EDL	00:36:13,664	00:36:18,656	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: But after sawing a John Denver cassette in half…
EDL	00:36:18,656	00:36:25,973	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: [laugh] Oh yeah, you went right through. You can see we got the tape itself is split.
EDL	00:36:25,973	00:36:27,531	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: Oh yeah.
EDL	00:36:27,531	00:36:34,208	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: My AP and really co-pilot on this series, Eli Cohen and I also set out to see if we could do this. So, first thing's first... 
EDL	00:36:34,208	00:36:38,368	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: We're going to have to destroy it further in order to bring it back to life. 
EDL	00:36:38,368	00:36:44,022	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: We had to get the John Denver tape outside of its broken cassette shell. Smashing it with a hammer...
EDL	00:36:44,022	00:36:45,664	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[smashing sounds]
EDL	00:36:45,664	00:36:53,237	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Now we've got some breakage and now it's quite like the experience of cracking open a crab leg or something. There we go.
EDL	00:36:53,237	00:36:54,667	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: [laughs]
EDL	00:36:54,667	00:36:56,032	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: [laughs]
EDL	00:36:56,032	00:36:57,610	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: With the John Denver tape out of its cassette...
EDL	00:36:57,610	00:37:00,405	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: We've got screws.
EDL	00:37:00,405	00:37:05,013	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Eli opened up the cassette we'd be transplanting John Denver into.
EDL	00:37:05,013	00:37:08,597	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And we taped the John Denver tape onto the new reel of tape.
EDL	00:37:08,597	00:37:10,262	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: Yeah.
EDL	00:37:10,262	00:37:12,672	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Snipped off the excess.
EDL	00:37:12,672	00:37:13,992	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Looks beautiful.
EDL	00:37:13,992	00:37:15,381	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: Oh, fuck!
EDL	00:37:15,381	00:37:17,975	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Struggled a bit.
EDL	00:37:17,975	00:37:19,392	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: Dammit!
EDL	00:37:19,392	00:37:20,330	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Okay.
EDL	00:37:20,330	00:37:21,973	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Eventually succeeded.
EDL	00:37:21,973	00:37:25,237	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Okay. It's time to sew the patient back up.
EDL	00:37:25,237	00:37:28,117	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And screwed the new cassette back together.
EDL	00:37:28,117	00:37:29,909	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: It looks functional!
EDL	00:37:29,909	00:37:34,154	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: Yeah. I don't see why it shouldn't play at this point.
EDL	00:37:34,154	00:37:38,421	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And so we popped it into my tape player.
EDL	00:37:38,421	00:37:40,853	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Big money, no whammies.
EDL	00:37:40,853	00:37:45,537	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[buzzing sound]
EDL	00:37:45,537	00:37:47,969	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: It doesn't want to move.
EDL	00:37:47,969	00:37:49,335	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Didn't work.
EDL	00:37:49,335	00:37:50,851	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Doesn't
EDL	00:37:50,851	00:37:52,364	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: No!
EDL	00:37:52,364	00:37:53,345	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Wait, hold on. Hold on.
EDL	00:37:53,345	00:38:00,567	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: We took the tape out and tried to wind it forward manually a bit. Put it back in. 
EDL	00:38:00,567	00:38:05,004	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: No…
EDL	00:38:05,004	00:38:06,818	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Still nothing.
EDL	00:38:06,818	00:38:08,759	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: Doctor, can you diagnose the patient here?
EDL	00:38:08,759	00:38:16,593	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: It—the host seems to be rejecting its new organ. I think the problem is the Scotch tape.
EDL	00:38:16,593	00:38:21,533	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And so, giving it one more shot, we manually wound a bunch of tape from the left reel onto the right reel.
EDL	00:38:21,533	00:38:25,821	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: So, we're losing the first song, basically. It might be okay.
EDL	00:38:25,821	00:38:27,868	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: All right. Let's try again.
EDL	00:38:27,868	00:38:29,255	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And...
EDL	00:38:29,255	00:38:37,393	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[John Denver’s Sunshine on my Shoulders song playing]
EDL	00:38:37,393	00:38:37,393	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	ELI COHEN: Whoo! 
EDL	00:38:37,393	00:38:49,169	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: We did it!
EDL	00:39:00,626	00:39:18,962	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Now, this tedious, painstaking repairing process, Professor Ye and others began doing it on a massive scale. Hiring folks to do the labor and distribute these tapes across the entire country. And he or someone like him eventually gave these things a name...
EDL	00:39:18,962	00:39:19,943	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: Dakou.
EDL	00:39:19,943	00:39:23,122	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Dakou, which just so happens to translate to...
EDL	00:39:23,122	00:39:29,458	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: Cut out. We somehow also invented this term.
EDL	00:39:29,458	00:39:31,378	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And they spread like wildfire.
EDL	00:39:31,378	00:39:37,522	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: I left China after ‘89. There weren’t dakou at that point and I came back in ‘91 and ‘92 and they were everywhere.
EDL	00:39:37,522	00:39:40,210	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: Even in cities that are not that big.
EDL	00:39:40,210	00:39:45,778	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Far-flung places like Ürümqi in Xinjiang, Dali in Yunnan.
EDL	00:39:45,778	00:39:52,647	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	WENHUA SHI: Outside of my home, there was a flower shop and the flower shop was selling dakou. That’s how crazy it is.
EDL	00:39:52,647	00:39:55,997	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: And they were affordable for Chinese consumers to buy.
EDL	00:39:55,997	00:40:19,293	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And there were so many of these things that the Chinese government really just had to throw up their hands. And so, folks all across China got to have their own little Apocalypse Now, This is the End moment. And for Hao Fang...
EDL	00:40:19,293	00:40:24,562	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	HAO FANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:40:24,562	00:40:34,789	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: Dakou was there when he needed it the most. The diversity dakou was able to provide him totally altered his life course.
EDL	00:40:34,789	00:40:38,898	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: He says without them, he definitely would not have become a music critic.
EDL	00:40:38,898	00:40:42,994	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	HAO FANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:40:42,994	00:40:53,746	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: And—so what he felt about dakou, if you have to summarize in one word is—gratitude.
EDL	00:40:53,746	00:40:57,458	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	HAO FANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:40:57,458	00:41:07,527	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	CHINESE REPORTER: Without dakou, he would not be him today. And Hao Fang thinks all these artists, many of them would not be them either.
EDL	00:41:07,527	00:41:23,506	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON Because these unregulatable garbage cassettes sparked a musical explosion. And totally reimagined what rock and roll was.
EDL	00:41:23,506	00:41:30,439	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:41:30,439	00:41:31,528	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: This is Li Yang.
EDL	00:41:31,528	00:41:34,578	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:41:34,578	00:41:46,077	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Today, he's a musician with tattooed sleeves crawling up each arm. And these dakou tapes are what inspired him and countless others to form bands in the first place.
EDL	00:41:46,077	00:41:49,085	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Do we know the name of his first band?
EDL	00:41:49,085	00:41:51,005	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: I'm not sure he told me that.
EDL	00:41:51,005	00:41:57,085	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: You know, everybody's embarrassed by the name of their first band, so he probably didn't want to tell you the name of it. [laughs]
EDL	00:41:57,085	00:41:58,642	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: Or he kept on saying...
EDL	00:41:58,642	00:42:01,245	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:42:01,245	00:42:04,572	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: I can't remember because of the life I've lived. That's all I can remember.
EDL	00:42:04,572	00:42:06,343	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:42:06,343	00:42:08,370	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: So, you know, I can only imagine.
EDL	00:42:08,370	00:42:10,013	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And that's Rebecca Kanthor.
EDL	00:42:10,013	00:42:11,463	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: Journalist in Shanghai.
EDL	00:42:11,463	00:42:14,877	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Who helped facilitate and conduct our interview with him. Anyhow...
EDL	00:42:14,877	00:42:23,069	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: Come as you are as your friend as your… [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:42:23,069	00:42:34,013	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: One of the 1st bands Li Yang heard was Nirvana. And he loved it. He wanted to hear more stuff like it, but he didn’t even know what genre to be looking for. 
EDL	00:42:34,013	00:42:35,405	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: Mmm..
EDL	00:42:35,405	00:42:36,892	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: No. No idea.
EDL	00:42:36,892	00:42:39,133	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:42:39,133	00:42:43,100	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: In fact, he wasn't even aware there were genres.
EDL	00:42:43,100	00:42:45,319	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:42:45,319	00:42:46,621	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: There was western music...
EDL	00:42:46,621	00:42:48,233	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Uh-huh.
EDL	00:42:48,233	00:42:52,231	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: And there was the music that everyone was listening to in China. Those were the two genres. Because... 
EDL	00:42:52,231	00:42:56,733	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:42:56,733	00:43:02,215	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: Nobody was there to teach us this is metal, this is punk, this is grunge, this is garage, this is emo. 
EDL	00:43:02,215	00:43:03,899	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:43:03,899	00:43:05,437	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: We were just not clear on this in the beginning.
EDL	00:43:05,437	00:43:12,647	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: I mean, all Li Yang had was the recording, nothing else. And so he was listening to all of this stuff…
EDL	00:43:12,647	00:43:13,842	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: With no context.
EDL	00:43:13,842	00:43:15,208	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Again, Kaiser Kuo.
EDL	00:43:15,208	00:43:20,650	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: No understanding of, you know, what this particular album is in the history of rock.
EDL	00:43:20,650	00:43:31,570	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: No sense that The Beatles came before AC/DC. Or that AC/DC came before Nirvana. There certainly was no sense of what was quote-unquote, "good."
EDL	00:43:31,570	00:43:38,653	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: So, for example, the Beatles and Bob Dylan, a lot of people complained about their sound, they're just, you know, very common sounds.
EDL	00:43:38,653	00:43:41,917	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Wait, wait, wait. People thought Bob Dylan and The Beatles were underwhelming?
EDL	00:43:41,917	00:43:43,709	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	MABU: [laughs] Yeah.
EDL	00:43:43,709	00:43:46,717	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And in their place, what folks were drawn to was…
EDL	00:43:46,717	00:43:49,383	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: God, there were so many, so many obscure bands.
EDL	00:43:49,383	00:43:50,831	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: For example ...
EDL	00:43:50,831	00:43:53,650	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[Sonata Arctica song playing]
EDL	00:43:53,650	00:43:58,365	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: This really obscure Finnish symphonic metal band.
EDL	00:43:58,365	00:43:59,922	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Called Sonata Arctica.
EDL	00:43:59,922	00:44:04,807	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[Sonata Arctica song playing]
EDL	00:44:04,807	00:44:06,727	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: There were a lot of them that were like that. 
EDL	00:44:06,727	00:44:09,906	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[Stratovarius song playing]
EDL	00:44:09,906	00:44:11,165	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Stratovarius, get it? 
EDL	00:44:11,165	00:44:12,872	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[Stratovarius song playing]
EDL	00:44:12,872	00:44:15,410	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: I think, also from Finland. Finland was overrepresented here, but…
EDL	00:44:15,410	00:44:17,267	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[Cannibal Corpse song playing]
EDL	00:44:17,267	00:44:18,524	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Cannibal Corpse. 
EDL	00:44:18,524	00:44:19,933	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[Cannibal Corpse song playing]
EDL	00:44:19,933	00:44:22,215	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: They’re a Flordian death metal band. They’re big. 
EDL	00:44:22,215	00:44:23,559	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Sort of. 
EDL	00:44:23,559	00:44:26,952	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: But I started seeing their cassettes all over in China.
EDL	00:44:26,952	00:44:30,002	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And for Kaiser, this is all sort of horrifying.
EDL	00:44:30,002	00:44:42,069	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: You know, I would say, for example, you got to start with The Beatles and The Stones and The Who, you can’t skip because Nirvana doesn't make sense unless you understand what it was in reaction to.
EDL	00:44:42,069	00:44:47,474	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Well, and I totally get that. Like, I studied jazz saxophone for 10 years.
EDL	00:44:47,474	00:44:48,882	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Really?
EDL	00:44:48,882	00:44:53,340	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And that is all about knowing exactly what came before what.
EDL	00:44:53,340	00:44:55,069	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Right, right.
EDL	00:44:55,069	00:45:02,822	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: And knowing who played what lick when, and quoting those licks in your solos to demonstrate a knowledge or an understanding of the form.
EDL	00:45:02,822	00:45:04,562	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
EDL	00:45:04,562	00:45:08,978	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: So I don't know. Like, there is value in understanding something in its context.
EDL	00:45:08,978	00:45:10,514	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Oh, for sure, yeah.
EDL	00:45:10,514	00:45:12,413	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: However, Kaiser says...
EDL	00:45:12,413	00:45:18,258	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: I mean, I kick myself now for having ever done this, sort of, School of Rock teaching.
EDL	00:45:18,258	00:45:19,645	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Hmm.
EDL	00:45:19,645	00:45:27,389	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Because, he says, of what happened next. Mid-2000s, Kaiser's at a music festival in China and who does he run into but... 
EDL	00:45:27,389	00:45:30,003	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:45:30,003	00:45:32,019	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Li Yang and the band he’s fronting.
EDL	00:45:32,019	00:45:33,490	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Called Demerit.
EDL	00:45:33,490	00:45:35,112	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese]
EDL	00:45:35,112	00:45:43,538	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: I see these guys. They show up to sound check and they've got gigantic mohawks, denim jackets and the spikes on them, Chuck Taylors.
EDL	00:45:43,538	00:45:48,316	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese] Sex Pistols, Ramones [speaking Mandarin Chinese].
EDL	00:45:48,316	00:45:55,762	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: They're dressed like a punk band. Which is what Li Yang was going for. He says in hindsight, the stuff he was listening to was...
EDL	00:45:55,762	00:45:57,789	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: Hardcore punk. [speaking Mandarin Chinese] Punk rock. 
EDL	00:45:57,789	00:46:01,586	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: But Kaiser notices that under this punk exterior...
EDL	00:46:01,586	00:46:10,738	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: They're wearing Iron Maiden t-shirts. I think that's ironic, right? They're kind of making fun of Iron Maiden. Ha ha. That's very funny.
EDL	00:46:10,738	00:46:28,395	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Because Iron Maiden is one of the classic heavy metal bands that plays these crazily technical songs with intricate guitar solos. Like, punk and metal is just a total musical mismatch. But then, later that day when it was Demerit’s slot to perform. 
EDL	00:46:28,395	00:46:31,327	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[Demerit song playing]
EDL	00:46:31,327	00:46:35,527	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: They get up and they start playing their songs. And they're like a, you know, punk, major chords.
EDL	00:46:35,527	00:46:37,746	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Exactly what Kaiser expected from a punk band.
EDL	00:46:37,746	00:46:40,135	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Kind of brash, bratty vocals.
EDL	00:46:40,135	00:46:45,319	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: But then part way through the song...
EDL	00:46:45,319	00:46:55,239	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: They bust into these dual guitar solos where they're—you know, they're shredding in tight harmony.
EDL	00:46:55,239	00:46:58,674	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[Demerit song playing]
EDL	00:46:58,674	00:47:04,413	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: It's this chimera of 70’s US punk and 80’s British metal.
EDL	00:47:04,413	00:47:06,349	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: And it's like, whoa! 
EDL	00:47:06,349	00:47:11,239	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	[Demerit song playing]
EDL	00:47:11,239	00:47:29,053	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: I thought in America, there's no punk band that would bother to, you know, apply that much technique and a metal band that would have been okay with that aesthetic, but it was great. It was like, this is a music I could really get into. And—and so I talked to them, I'm asking, “So aren't you guys punk?" 
EDL	00:47:29,053	00:47:32,402	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Like, how do you think about these genres that you’re blending together?
EDL	00:47:32,402	00:47:34,258	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: And so...
EDL	00:47:34,258	00:47:36,647	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese] 
EDL	00:47:36,647	00:47:38,034	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: They said, "We don't really care about that."
EDL	00:47:38,034	00:47:40,167	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese] 
EDL	00:47:40,167	00:47:46,632	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: There was something freeing that he didn't—he didn't know what it all was and so he...
EDL	00:47:46,632	00:47:50,919	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese] 
EDL	00:47:50,919	00:47:53,735	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: He didn't have any rules. He could just make stuff.
EDL	00:47:53,735	00:47:56,210	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese] 
EDL	00:47:56,210	00:47:58,152	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: Make music, mixing everything together.
EDL	00:47:58,152	00:48:01,330	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese] 
EDL	00:48:01,330	00:48:02,567	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: The way that he wanted to.
EDL	00:48:02,567	00:48:22,599	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: He was able to make music liberated from its own history, its own expectations. And all across China, other musicians were doing this same thing. Obliviously mixing rock with bebop with outlaw country with classical.
EDL	00:48:22,599	00:48:46,505	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: It was such an odd, completely disembodied borrowing. It was free of context. Free of obligation. It was like taking a plant away from its soil, dusting off any residue of the old soil and putting it in this totally different soil with a different pH level, different level of the amount of sunlight. It's going to grow differently and it did.
EDL	00:48:46,505	00:48:53,405	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: It's sort of the mixtape—on the grandest of scales.
EDL	00:48:53,405	00:49:02,194	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	KAISER KUO: Exactly. Exactly. And the impact that it had on that generation was just utterly profound.
EDL	00:49:02,194	00:49:07,442	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese] 
EDL	00:49:07,442	00:49:16,658	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: For him, the biggest impact of dakou cassettes was not music, it was about him finding a new way to think about the world.
EDL	00:49:16,658	00:49:19,154	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese] 
EDL	00:49:19,154	00:49:22,375	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: Maybe he didn't know he was searching for it, but when he heard it, he was like, "Oh!"
EDL	00:49:22,375	00:49:24,167	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese] 
EDL	00:49:24,167	00:49:28,455	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: "Yeah, that's me!"
EDL	00:49:28,455	00:49:32,252	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	LI YANG: [speaking Mandarin Chinese] 
EDL	00:49:32,252	00:49:35,367	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	REBECCA KANTHOR: So, dakou, it was just like a little window.

EDL	00:50:02,812	00:50:42,385	| radiolab_podcast102221_mixtapedakou |	SIMON: Now, what strikes me about all this, more than anything, is that we’re all sort of living in this world now.
