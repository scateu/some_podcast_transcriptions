1
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
Virus

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Eagle One

3
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Package being delivered right around two years ago Marcus Hutchins better-known

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:35,328
Why is hacker named malwaretech was at the Las Vegas airport waiting for flight to go back home to the UK

5
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:41,728
Was hungover coming back from Defcon the biggest hacker conference in the world and that when the feds came

6
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
What's more at the time the twenty-three-year-old security researcher was hailed as a hero

7
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,224
Stopping the spread of the wannacry ransomware worm

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,112
On this week's cyber we talk to Marcy wheeler McClain journalist who covers National Security

9
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,512
She's covered this case from the beginning and it's going to tell us the story of Hutchins and where he is today

10
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
So

11
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,960
Marcy take me back to the beginning

12
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,264
What happened to Marcus Hutchins

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
2 years ago after death

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,872
He was

15
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Getting ready

16
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,968
I need to board his plane to go back to the UK

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,600
The FBI came up to him and said hey we need to talk to you and brought him down into and

18
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
Interrogation room

19
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,976
And critically for the story interviewed him for 90 minutes

20
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,768
And then put them under arrest

21
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,840
And he was

22
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:44,704
In detention for over the weekend until he got a pair of really great lawyers

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,496
And it's

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
I know it's over

25
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,336
Marcus Hutchins who is he

26
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,432
And why was he significant story among the infosec community

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
What is a malware researcher

28
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
In May of 2017 when this Global malware launched

29
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,440
Across the globe called wannacry

30
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,840
It looked at first like an attack just on hospitals in the UK but it's now becoming clear that they smell delicious soft

31
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
Run Riot around the world

32
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,728
She did what he normally does which is register

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
The domain.

34
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
Seems to be a command and control for the malware

35
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
And

36
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Unbeknownst

37
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,176
To him that ended up sinkholing the malware

38
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
So he stopped

39
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,296
The largest malware attack in the world

40
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,600
To that point in arguably

41
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Would have

42
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,744
By just registering a domain and save the world

43
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,608
From probably some of the most malicious ransomware that's ever been created really

44
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Based off of

45
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
So

46
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,776
Nsa's tools get leaked on online

47
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,336
And the US and UK government

48
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,408
Now attributed to North Korea

49
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,504
Turns it into this Global malware that but he

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
On his day off

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
Ends up shutting down just by Regice

52
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
For example in the UK

53
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,256
The the hospitals were being shut down because

54
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,328
They couldn't operate their computers their computers were being

55
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Shutdown

56
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,704
Is that kind of impact that entire factories were being shut down

57
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,752
Because their computers were being

58
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
Basically held Ransom

59
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
And as I heard it she was hungover

60
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,736
At Las Vegas Airport which I cannot confirm or deny I have also been hungover after Defcon

61
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
The defense

62
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,088
I've been partying quite a bit

63
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:42,464
That he had slept virtually not at all and they also hinted at the fact that he had used

64
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,376
Some kind of drugs although they did not officially say what that was in Port so that it actually came to be

65
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,704
The issues that was litigated over the last two years is whether or not

66
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,776
When he was interviewed by the FBI

67
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,872
He knew what he was getting into because he was just wiped from being a death on all week

68
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
Why why did the FBI

69
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Want him

70
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
What what do they want them for

71
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:11,136
Okay so they arrested him for Computer Fraud and Abuse Act because that's what you always arrest hack

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
And the Chargers really into

73
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
They arrested him

74
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,559
Having written

75
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,375
Hold that had been sold

76
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:28,031
To an FBI agent or Homeland Security investigations agent or somebody in the Federal

77
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Back in

78
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
2050

79
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,103
Teen

80
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
In Wisconsin

81
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,967
So it was malware called

82
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Kronos

83
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Stop

84
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,807
Had been renewed

85
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
In a couple of

86
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,623
Iterations and

87
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,695
Still sort of is used in some attacks

88
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
And he had written some of

89
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,559
Didn't happen yesterday at that point

90
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,327
It was

91
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
2 years old at the time

92
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,959
They would add some charges later but it was two years old at the

93
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
Prime

94
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
But he had been at Defcon here before

95
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
So

96
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Somebody in Wisconsin

97
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Baijiu

98
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
Piece of malware in 2015

99
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,759
He comes to Defcon in 2016 they don't arrest him then

100
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,527
He comes

101
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,343
Defcon in 2017 he's a hero

102
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
That's when they decide to

103
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
Is there any connection to that

104
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,463
The government says

105
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
The government says

106
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,071
Their explanation for why

107
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,607
They didn't arrest him in 20

108
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,655
16th of June 2017 is that

109
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Somebody that

110
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
He gave

111
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,031
The malware to to pay off a debt

112
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
In

113
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,103
2014-2015

114
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Basically

115
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
Became a narc

116
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
And one of the things he offered up the government was Marcus

117
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
And he has

118
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:49,439
West Hutchins showing Hutchins basically admitting that that he had written this malware

119
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
The guy that gave him up

120
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,023
Was not processed

121
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
That guy actually

122
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
Didn't did still

123
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Did Robin

124
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
So the guy who committed the actual crime

125
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,519
Was not arrested

126
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
Marcus Watts

127
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,895
Why the FBI so intent on going after him

128
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
So this guy gif

129
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
Does the government chat logs involving her

130
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
What happened

131
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,343
According to them I think it was late 26th

132
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,367
So

133
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
Their claim is

134
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
They didn't

135
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,951
Have this evidence

136
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,815
Hutchinson sole 2016 and so the next time you come back in the United States

137
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
Which happens to be after he had

138
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
Wannacry

139
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
Then they decided

140
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,775
To arrest him but the other thing that's going on is it's very clear

141
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,103
Quotes from the court record mother things that I've

142
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Been Told

143
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,247
Stop by him but by other people who are familiar with what the FBI was doing at the time

144
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,087
It's very clear that they wanted to arrest him to turn him into a name

145
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
So even in that first

146
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,695
90 minute interview with the FBI

147
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
They were saying

148
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Tell us about these other

149
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
People you know

150
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,863
So basically what the head down whether it was in late 26

151
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,679
Teen p*** 2017 after they works

152
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,495
Trying to figure out who had sinkhole Wanna Cry

153
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Bighead dumbness

154
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,591
Map of who Hutchins new online

155
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,895
And there's a guy named Benny who was his

156
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,967
Co-conspirator who's the guy who actually sold the malware

157
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
Had some ties

158
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
I think it's you

159
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Ukrainian

160
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,599
Kind of

161
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:27,487
Network of Ukrainian hackers that a different part of the FBI not the part of the FBI been arrested

162
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,327
Hutchins not the FBI people who actually interviewed him

163
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,167
A different part of the FBI was investigating those ukrainians

164
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,751
Because

165
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,775
Hutchins

166
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
How to Interactive

167
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:45,407
With some of them online the FBI in their Infinite Wisdom said hey

168
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
Lex arrest

169
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,711
A guy who just

170
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,063
Save the world and try and turn them into our informants to get at these other half

171
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,647
That's the hope that's okay

172
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,695
I mean that's what the FBI always does

173
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:03,839
Why did thought it would be a good idea with the guy to just save the world I don't know but I'm not the FBI so I can explain to him

174
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
Remains in jail in custody

175
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
Just for the weekend

176
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
Motherboard Vice

177
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:14,079
Reported that he had been arrested and so the infosec community came out

178
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:18,687
For him and said we're going to raise money we're going to get your lawyers were going to be taken care of

179
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,735
There were some people who

180
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
Learned that he had been a rough

181
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Did

182
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,695
Well they were still in Vegas so they stayed and came back and you know kind of rallied around him and so

183
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,767
I think the FBI assumed that he would not

184
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,791
Good lawyers

185
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
And once he did that sort of screwed up their plants

186
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
It's been litigated until very recently

187
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
Is the two-year process

188
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,567
So that he pleads guilty

189
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
In May

190
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
And

191
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,295
When you goes to sentencing that's literally the first time he's in a courtroom with the actual judge presiding over his case

192
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,623
And so when it came to sentencing the judge was basically like

193
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,951
I have no idea why the government thought it was a good idea

194
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,999
Prosecuted the guy who just saved the world

195
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,351
It's about 90 minutes from to say that ultimately

196
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Chad Hutchins

197
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,423
At the beginning

198
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
Has there been a weight

199
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
To go to the judge and say

200
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:21,407
What do you think about the wisdom of Prosecuting the guy who just saved the world on charges that are years old

201
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:25,247
That the government agrees he's not engaged in criminally anymore

202
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,295
What do you think about the wisdom of that then

203
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,599
We might have avoided that hold to your process

204
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
But that's not the way the US

205
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
So what does this whole thing say about

206
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
The FBI and its

207
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Perspective in a relationship

208
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
Towards

209
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
Packers

210
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,911
I mean it's a larger question about their

211
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,959
Towards how they solve crimes

212
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
Because they're always going to want to go for a foreman

213
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
Even though

214
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
Have they gone to Marcus

215
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Instead

216
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
Do you know these Ukrainian hackers

217
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,759
Probably would have answered just as honestly as he did when he was

218
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
You know about the arrest

219
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
But they chose not to

220
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Do that they chose to try and Cora Simmons

221
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Is this relationship

222
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,207
That ended up not working

223
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,791
Hutchins been when he was interviewed and still to this day says he

224
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
Didn't have the information that the FBI wanted in the first place

225
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,631
But

226
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
They would have avoided this embarrass

227
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,215
You know they went for having

228
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
The corporation over him

229
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
Rather than just asking

230
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,871
And asking at a time where he was cooperating

231
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,711
You know not just on on wannacry but he was cooperating

232
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
With

233
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:33,343
The ncsc in the UK kind of equivalent in the United States of DHS

234
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,415
And chasing down wannacry in you know

235
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,207
Responding to malware so

236
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,791
He was working with law enforcement anyway which is one of the things that

237
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
The judge said and sentencing by the way

238
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
So it

239
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,679
Just it's a name that the FBI decided

240
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
Is that in the United States they were going to find a way to try and course

241
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
The Sabbath that's what they did

242
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,311
Infiniti no heat

243
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
Didn't he

244
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Didn't have the in

245
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Mission

246
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
They then felt

247
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,967
Obliged and I mean this happens

248
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
In a lot of kinds of cases

249
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,343
Bait bait bait I think felt obliged

250
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,951
To continue with the prosecution maybe believing that if they did so

251
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,023
If you were facing more coercion then he would

252
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,559
And

253
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
It just another cat going down the path

254
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,423
It was never a time and never a person who said

255
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,215
This is moronic

256
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
Turn around

257
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Tell him to go home

258
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
And just stopped

259
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
Does process

260
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
And that's really

261
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
I know I've heard of

262
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
People within the FBI who were like this

263
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,599
Cuckoo for several reasons one because it

264
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,927
Stupid into because they do need to cooperate with hackers

265
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
And with researchers

266
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
And

267
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,815
And what happened to Hutchins was

268
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:52,191
Just so inane and it created a lot of bad blood with him from community

269
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,263
What does it say about the Computer Fraud and

270
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Exact and how it's going to

271
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Be used for

272
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
This as a press

273
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Dangerous

274
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
For anybody who's in in eastern time

275
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Wisconsin

276
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
And it wasn't just

277
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,599
Cfab ended up adding eavesdropping charges wiretapping charges basically

278
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
And in a number of places

279
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
Around the country

280
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Software is not

281
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
Centered a wiretapping device

282
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
And Hutchins

283
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
His lawyers argue

284
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
You died and lost

285
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,399
And so now that's a precedent in this District

286
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
And again

287
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
They argue

288
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,543
Iudex selling malware should not get your prosecutor to CFA

289
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
They lost on that

290
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
2

291
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
And

292
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
The government

293
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Seated and getting him to

294
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,455
To plead guilty under CFA

295
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,503
Because the alternative for him

296
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Was

297
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
More more prison time

298
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
She's going home

299
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
So it works out for him

300
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
And he's not going to be subject

301
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
Milwaukee

302
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511
But there are going to be you know some

303
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:54,143
15 year old kids Milwaukee who you know that the government is going to use these precedents and say

304
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,007
If you're researching now where we can go after you for CFA and end that is

305
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,287
Really dangerous

306
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,151
Also how do you you know how do you alienate the very people that can find this stuff

307
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:10,783
And inevitably save the world want to be hyperbolic but

308
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
It was unprecedented

309
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
In the sentencing hearing

310
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,487
Is he basically said you know it's not my job to park new but you sure

311
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
You should probably go get a part

312
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
Because you

313
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Should be able to come back

314
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,375
This country and help us

315
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
Shut down

316
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,447
You know cyber security threats like you did

317
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
And to do that you're either going

318
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
I need a waiver or you're going to need

319
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Departing so you should apply for a pardon

320
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
And you know hopefully that'll work

321
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:37,919
Again

322
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
You said

323
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,967
You just pissed off

324
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
The infosec community and made

325
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,343
The act of trying to understand how malware works

326
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Criminal

327
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
So what next for Marcus

328
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
What's he going to do

329
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
What are the thing

330
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
The judge made of

331
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
Saying was that he had no intention

332
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
Rice

333
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
Immigration and Customs Enforcement to get their hands on Hutchins

334
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
What happens sometimes

335
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
If you're a foreigner in the United

336
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
States and you have been convicted

337
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,103
Is there's a formal deportation process and that

338
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Can

339
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
Sometimes lie

340
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Detention by Ice

341
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
Tomato

342
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,295
What's the point of saying look I have no intention

343
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
That ice

344
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,135
Their hands on the sky I have no intention of him being another

345
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Statistics

346
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
If I were Marcus

347
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
I would leave

348
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
Sooner rather than later to prevent that

349
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Happening

350
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
And he's going to return to the UK and

351
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
He's going to work

352
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,703
Again still in security and in malware research

353
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
And

354
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
He said he wants to

355
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
Do more teaching

356
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
Do more teaching of young people so they don't end up

357
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,407
You know developing criminal past

358
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Contact

359
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Did for him

360
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,247
What I find so interesting about this

361
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,599
Cases that it's obviously not a whistleblower situation but it's a situation where

362
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,695
The government wants to know something from you once information

363
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
You don't give it to them

364
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
They find a way to punish

365
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,631
Before I missing something I find we're seeing more and more of when it comes to stuff to do with infosec

366
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,167
Go to come to do with things that

367
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,959
Are involving sensitive

368
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
And it's just a real shame the

369
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Clearly very Talent

370
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,335
The guy

371
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
Had to go through this entire ordeal

372
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
To the Head

373
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
Essentially be acquitted and now go home

374
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
It certainly Within

375
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:18,783
The hacking

376
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Community

377
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,831
You know there are famous

378
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
Does cases most

379
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,183
Famous Abu but there are plenty of them of somebody who got flipped

380
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:29,279
So yesterday in the whole cyber security industry and the hacker

381
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
The hacktivist movement

382
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Was

383
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Shaken by this news

384
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,143
That's a Buddhist

385
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
High-level hacker Anonymous and

386
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,007
The leader of the subgroup Caldwell sec

387
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,311
Had been a government informant for months

388
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
So the FBI has this habit of

389
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
Leaving that's how they solved

390
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
These cases

391
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,711
Obviously that's how Hutchins

392
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,247
Just got in trouble in the first place

393
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,039
Because they had flip some other dude

394
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
And he gave up Marcus

395
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,159
You know that's sort of the way the FBI thinks and

396
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
May not be

397
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
True

398
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
The really important

399
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,279
Point here is that

400
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Hutchins

401
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
Didn't have the information they wanted

402
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,631
Or at least he still claims he

403
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,679
They didn't have the information they wanted

404
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
And there was no way out for

405
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,007
There was no way for

406
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,055
Reset and say oh well

407
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
We tried to call

408
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:19,199
You're not going to give it to us you know they just kept doubling down and doubling down and doubling down

409
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
Isn't this a real strain of Vengeance there too though

410
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,295
You know it's something you wouldn't

411
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
Spectra government

412
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
Yeah it was interesting because

413
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,183
The day that he pled guilty there was only one other journalist

414
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
In the courtroom

415
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:33,023
The entire back row

416
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
The courtroom was

417
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
Skilled with FBI

418
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,167
And you could get was at including the two that had had to take

419
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
The stand

420
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
And you know

421
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,519
They were those two agents

422
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
Embarrassed

423
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,079
They both

424
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
In various ways that they'd fuk up

425
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,991
And because they were embarrassed and because the cross

426
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
Computers were embarrassed I felt like

427
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,343
You know okay we're going to we're going to do this

428
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
Superseding indictment and we're going to get

429
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
You now

430
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
And

431
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:06,559
You know that the embarrassment of the FBI and the improprieties if they were mild

432
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,119
Improprieties in the arrest process

433
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
On the part bus

434
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Agents

435
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
That might have been an

436
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
Trinity in a government that

437
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,335
Was working at my donut go to bed an opportunity say oh you know what

438
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
We had a screwed up on this arrest

439
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,943
We don't think it's that important anyway so why don't you

440
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,503
You just get on a plane and instead they just doubled

441
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
That's the way that is the way the

442
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,855
The FBI

443
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
Andy rj10 store

444
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,719
I think they tend to once you get in the system

445
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
We're going to find a way to prosecute

446
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
You one way or another

447
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,631
And it leads to

448
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,423
It can lead to

449
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
Do you know

450
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Well

451
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,103
I mean I'm glad he's going home. This is wrapped up I hope he does get that part but

452
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,503
Yeah that me thanks for coming on the show to talk about this is very important case

453
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
Snow today

454
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,999
