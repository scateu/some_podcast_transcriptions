00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Eagle one package being delivered hi I'm Jason Keppler editor-in-chief

00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
Charity reporter Ben McCoo will you might know as a normal host of the show Ben and vice can I report

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
Lamoureux recently spent months and better than a secret neo-nazis social network called the base

5
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
At least one person in the last two years there's been a lot of reporting about how the election of Donald

6
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
Trump as involved in the far-right and violent groups online and in real life but often were talking about hate

7
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704
Memes are well-publicized rallies the base meanwhile isn't focused on memes has been

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,104
Explains their focus on meeting up and carrying out violent acts in the real world

9
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,480
So bad you spent the last few months tracking a

10
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
Cell

11
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
Neo-nazis online

12
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
Tell me what is the base

13
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,136
Okay sell the bass

14
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,696
I found out about the bass

15
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,744
Online because

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
I made a habit of

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
B&D bunnies

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
Neo-Nazi Milton Twitter circles

19
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
And

20
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
My reporting partner and I'm a clamorous

21
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,800
I've been breaking a lot of stories surrounding atomwaffen division we can get into it atomwaffen division is after

22
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
But

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,640
It's actually people who could be Neo-Nazi Terror

24
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,248
We've kept on them in much the same way that ice is active online on Twitter

25
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
Or what

26
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
Fort Lauderdale takedowns

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
We've been noticing

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
That these groups

29
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Behave much in the same way

30
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
These are American Neo-Nazi groups and also there's there's only so many white people in the world so

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,096
Just imagine literally any country with

32
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,376
Native white people

33
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,168
Has a Neo-Nazi

34
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,960
Aspect to it honey Nazi

35
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Aspect to it

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,032
Play selection liner Norway or England

37
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
France

38
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
Italy

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
And

40
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,640
One individual particular kept coming up

41
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,480
In almost every Circle we looked at in the guy's name is Norman spear

42
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,320
And I don't know if that's his real name we suspect it's an alias

43
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
Susan Sorensen that we did

44
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
It's possible it is his name

45
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,208
And he kept showing up in the circle

46
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
Bonafide atomwaffen division group members

47
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
New Ulm fall autumn

48
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,656
She obviously came up on a radar because of it

49
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,008
And I kept an eye on them and suddenly I think sometime and

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
I want to see August or July

51
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
Eastern advertising has been called the base

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
And what it was

53
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,480
With a place and use advertising as a sort of survivalist self defense network

54
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
But yet

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,552
All the propaganda that he was

56
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
Putting out there was extremely military

57
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,416
Resting stuff like when shit hits the fan

58
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488
Apocalyptic thing in the United States refer to one

59
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,560
You know society disintegrates and it turns into a race war

60
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
There was stuff advocating

61
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,960
Essentially Guerrilla war in this is a guy who also put up videos on guerrilla warfare

62
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
Techniques

63
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,264
Manuel's

64
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,056
And you claim to be an ex

65
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,128
Iraq war Afghan war veteran

66
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
And I start to think what is this thing

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,224
Send me the Twitter account shows up

68
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
And then there's a WordPress

69
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
Account connected

70
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
Were you can go and you can apply to get inside of it

71
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
Piqued my interest

72
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,184
And what did you find plague what is

73
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
The base

74
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,792
So with the bases we found in this is after quite a few months

75
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,632
Of monitoring the Twitter accounts modern the people involved with the Twitter accounts

76
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
And then also we gained access

77
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,032
To their vetting process and then also there secret chat Noir

78
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,336
So it's kind of like a Discord but it was on

79
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,176
Riot chat in much the same way atomwaffen division had

80
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,760
A Discord that was infiltrated by propublica

81
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
We kind of got into the bases

82
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
Lightshot and washed it

83
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
And

84
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
Saw what was going on

85
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,696
Right so you served describe this as a

86
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,744
Paramilitary social network

87
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,119
Very small very insular but very dedicated to real-world action

88
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,935
What did you find on the base because there's a lot of

89
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,799
You know white supremacy Neo-Nazi forums chat rooms out there but this

90
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Is it totally different so

91
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,175
One of the goals of Norman spear that he

92
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
Advocated for was he said the movement

93
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,247
Essentially

94
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,063
Fascist white power movement around the world

95
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
Is way too much about

96
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
Twitter trolls

97
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,695
And online chatter and not enough about

98
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,975
Wheelworld Meetup

99
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
And hang out

100
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
And let's be

101
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Together

102
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
And go Fargo

103
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Which is

104
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
White supremacy

105
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,191
Possibly a white power State you know

106
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,495
Score settling with race traitors with

107
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Different

108
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,287
Ethnic groups

109
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
Black Americans Jewish Americans

110
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,151
So in order to achieve that

111
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
What the base was doing for my reporting

112
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
With funneling these

113
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,015
Extremist

114
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
Far-right

115
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
Twitter trolls

116
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
Also some of them were

117
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Very much affiliated with real groups

118
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,999
Finally I'm into the base for this website

119
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,839
And then once they got vetted and then were in the actual secure chat

120
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
The planned

121
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,447
Regionally meetups where they would go and learn things like

122
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Paramilitary skills

123
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,079
Bushcraft skills and I was one thing we started Wonder was you know how much of this is real

124
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
They're actually meeting up in person

125
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,455
Enter the photos of them meeting up in person

126
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
And

127
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,295
You know we found a library that they were sharing with

128
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
With stuff like

129
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,391
Chemical weapons production by weapons production

130
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
Weapons handling

131
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,023
Gunsmithing, saying we

132
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,071
Explosive bomb making

133
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
And then we started seeing some insane shatter

134
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
To be honest with you

135
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,983
Stuff that was going beyond the realm of LARPing

136
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
And into the space of

137
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,823
You know even some online militant groups

138
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
Won't

139
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Say some of the s*** these guys were

140
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
We're saying

141
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,991
Stuff like you know I really want to get together with some people and plan something for real

142
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
I'm paraphrasing

143
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
Indirect action

144
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
Something with explosions

145
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,183
In reference to the Pittsburgh shooter they were also

146
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,279
Completely valorizing somebody who'd gone up and shot and killed mother

147
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
Individuals innocent people

148
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
China place of worship

149
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
For you know carrying out these attacks against

150
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
Juice because

151
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,495
Surprise

152
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
Neo-nazis

153
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
The real problem with

154
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
People Jewish faith

155
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:43,711
And the stuff they were saying about them running the country that are very much reminiscent of

156
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,759
Of the individual that wants that synagogue in

157
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
And shot the people up at least 11 people are dead and six more wounded after a man walk into a synagogue near downtown

158
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,231
Pittsburgh with an assault rifle and 3 handgun

159
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
An open fire

160
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
And that's what really for Mackinaw

161
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
We talk to ourselves

162
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,167
This is really going to something else we need to

163
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,447
Run the story soon

164
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Because

165
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
We brought this to the Southern Poverty Law Center

166
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,079
We said luck we found this group is

167
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,359
This is what they've been discussing

168
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
What are your thoughts

169
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,919
Essentially they gave us

170
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
A massive statement on how this is

171
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
Exactly how

172
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
Right-wing extremism

173
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
Acts of Terror are organized

174
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,879
And learned

175
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
And take place

176
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,743
Norman spear didn't respond to requests for comment

177
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
Sent before Bend article published

178
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,095
But after I went online he sent the following

179
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:37,215
The base is illegal survivalist and self-defense Network for sharing information on those topics

180
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,287
And for organizing training sessions related to those topic

181
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,847
It is not engaged in paramilitary training

182
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,431
Nor is the base a militia or paramilitary organization

183
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223
You have taken lines from chat logs

184
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
Specifically out of context

185
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,367
In order to fabricate a fictitious and deliberately Sensational story

186
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
That simply isn't true

187
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,975
Were they actually talking about

188
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Specific

189
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
Planned attacks online or what

190
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
There's no incidents of violence

191
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,143
That have been

192
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
Attributed to the base

193
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,727
Yats right as of yet no

194
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
I'm not aware of it

195
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
The definitions to atomwaffen division

196
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:18,175
Are there lights members atomwaffen division within an atom was envisioned being a

197
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Neo-Nazi

198
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,271
Doterra group in the United States that the FBI is very much all over

199
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Yes

200
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,879
Do they have connections to killings and racially motivated violence yes

201
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,951
I did these people talk about direct actions

202
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Against

203
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
People they didn't like

204
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Ie

205
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Races of people didn't like

206
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Absolutely

207
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
Now

208
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:41,215
Have They Carried anything out yet we don't know and that's actually the thing that's really scary about the

209
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
And that's what a lot of extremist

210
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
Onlookers

211
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
And critics War

212
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:51,711
Will say is that this kind of place where you're given access to a lot of these tools

213
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:56,063
Or these manuals or these discussions were things are ratcheted up

214
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:59,135
And people can possibly meet regionally

215
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Which we know that they were doing

216
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,975
That's where some of these Lone Wolf attacks

217
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,767
To carry out that's weird stuff

218
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,119
Happens and that's the really scary part is all it takes is a couple of these people

219
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
If I could so sequestered

220
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
And so funnel down into this group of

221
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,751
Real true believers

222
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
You have

223
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
Almost a maximization

224
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
Potential harm that can happen

225
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
When you're discussing these kind

226
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
Right and there's discussion on

227
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,807
Todd the bass about note in real life meetups

228
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
2 plans

229
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Tax rate

230
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
No they would say let's meet up

231
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
Train

232
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Let's train for the future

233
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
And learn skills together

234
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,399
Right I mean while they trade stuff like I remember one sweet the Norman spear did was

235
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
How to cover up a sniper killing

236
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
So if you kill someone with a sniper rifle

237
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
In public

238
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
How to make sure you wipe

239
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Any evidence of your gun

240
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Being involved in that attack

241
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
Meanwhile there's also tweets from the base

242
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
About counter-surveillance measures Against drones

243
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,343
Against being followed by federal authorities

244
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,671
And this is sort of the stuff that they were they were they were trading at

245
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,231
Which you know it doesn't take a

246
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,535
A rocket scientist for PhD

247
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
In extremism

248
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631
To know that this is this is very much to do a terrorist

249
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Right

250
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
So

251
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,775
Serve in the lead-up to the 2016 election and after that

252
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
There are a lot of articles about Trump's Troll Army and white supremacist memes and Anniston Madrid memes that

253
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
Going viral

254
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
And I did a lot of recording

255
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
At that time just

256
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,599
It's about you know how these memes are made and how their

257
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,439
Brad and that's her thing in there Amplified by the media and that's her thing

258
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
You spoke to experts in the space who said that the memes that are made by the base which there are means and there

259
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:48,959
You know much more vile than the certain things that you probably seen on Twitter liveries

260
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Specific you mentioned sir

261
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,311
Pittsburgh shooter there's a lot of memes about that guy are they talk about

262
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,639
Wanting to make memes valorizing him

263
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:03,295
That's where you spoke to said that these means don't need to go viral in order for there to be like real-world impact

264
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:09,439
Can you talk a little bit about that absolutely Miss goes back to even sore the trading of information and manual

265
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
That's right

266
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
What it is is your in this Echo chamber but it's an extremist Echo chamber it's gathered people who really are True Believer

267
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
How many create things

268
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
In that space

269
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
When you know your audience

270
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
Better than anyone else

271
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,567
There's this opportunity to make someone

272
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Extremely angry

273
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
Extremely

274
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
Galvanized to do something

275
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
So

276
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,783
You know I mean I did a lot of work on that as well on the alt right

277
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
And some of the amines are putting around

278
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
I'm happy

279
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
And

280
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
Memes

281
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,439
Or maybe the most powerful

282
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Visual tool

283
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
From an actual neurological stand

284
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
It is coming the CIA is interested in something

285
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
NATO's in

286
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Send something

287
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
MIT is interested in

288
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,543
And when you have a specific group dealing with one another knowing exactly what they want to read

289
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
When you read that you can be

290
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,943
Potential lone-wolf especially when you're also on the other hand provided with

291
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
Manuel's

292
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
Describing

293
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
How to create bombs

294
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,671
Right does not suggest that like the memes are the thing that push people over the edge we can't know that for sure

295
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
But

296
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,559
You are taking a group that is already shown that they are radicalized and

297
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:22,399
Your amplifying it because these people have been vetted and they're sort of

298
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,727
Talking to sort of the most extreme

299
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:31,103
Aspects of this ideology right absolutely any that's exactly how it works and it you know

300
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,687
I started getting to terrorism reporting originally

301
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,015
When I was inside of very similar chat groups

302
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
Very similar online activities

303
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
Advice is not high

304
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,439
You know it looks the exact same that's one thing that's really shocked me about this

305
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
Is that

306
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
It's all very reminiscent

307
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
Is that

308
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
And I spoke to a lot of booze

309
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
Does individual

310
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,215
And they behave and speak exactly like the end of

311
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
Different

312
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
With the means of using

313
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,383
Secret chat networks are using the apps in a beer using

314
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
To organize

315
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
And galvanized and radicalize your movements

316
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,343
I mean this is tried-and-true by someone with prolific jihadist groups

317
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:19,999
Yeah I know that some of your early reporting at motherboard was about survival Western

318
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,327
Freedom Fighters or whatever you want to call them who went and joined Isis

319
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:30,239
I'm curious you mention that the makeup is very similar just in terms of the chat networks and the types of things at their share

320
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:37,407
Do you think that they are learning from each other or is this something that is just so native to like online poll

321
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,479
Alltran organizing at this point that you know if you want to have liquor

322
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
Clandestine

323
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,319
Organization this is the type of way that you do it

324
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,111
I can absolutely learn

325
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
From one another

326
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
The bass learn from

327
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
This

328
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:54,303
You know 2013-2014 movement of Isis where they use Twitter they used

329
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
Your chat. FM Instagram Etc to organize

330
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Galvanized

331
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,703
I think they learned that in fact

332
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
The base

333
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
It's called the base

334
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
I know that they're aware

335
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Hbase means

336
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
Al-Qaeda in Arabic

337
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
So at the end

338
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
That's me

339
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
Is RBC a tongue and cheek

340
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
Way of looking at

341
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
Themselves as a terrorist group

342
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
That's not

343
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,391
Completely confirmed I don't know why they call themselves that

344
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
But clearly

345
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
There's some inference going on now

346
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
I mean absolute learn from them

347
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,887
I think it also attract quite honestly the same demographics of

348
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Young man

349
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Core online

350
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
AR

351
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
To some degree or another

352
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
TekSavvy

353
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
Cool

354
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
Are looking for a Cause

355
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
2

356
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Are angry

357
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
And who else are pretty good at Twitter

358
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
Yeah yeah

359
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:55,487
So you mentioned the Southern Poverty Law Center which is this nonprofit group that tracks hate online in real life

360
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,815
I think most of the United States but possibly worldwide

361
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:05,215
I'm curious you know what did they have to say about this and also you know is the US government aware of this happening

362
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,543
Is anything being done to stop it is a proliferating

363
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Well

364
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,871
Answer that last question first

365
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,919
Every single chat platform

366
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
And almond application

367
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
M.

368
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,503
That the base was on

369
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Go to the mall

370
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,295
Including Gap

371
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,319
Which I thought was pretty shocked

372
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
It was almost as if

373
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
The base

374
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Extreme

375
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Forgot

376
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,951
Which of the wild one

377
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
Right and grab is this very like right wing

378
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Offshoot of

379
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:30,815
Twitter

380
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:36,447
Yeah I called Neo-Nazi Twitter yeah and I know that they don't describe themselves that way but I don't really care cuz there any free

381
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Free speech and I'm going to freely say

382
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
I think it's Neo-Nazi Twitter

383
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
So they're all off. I think it's blown up

384
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,919
That said you know I'm tracking where it's going next

385
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
And we'll see

386
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
RG3 is aware of the base

387
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,063
I can't say for sure

388
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,879
But I certainly gathered information

389
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
That would suggest

390
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,207
That the FBI's wear with the bases

391
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
And

392
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
Is aware of it

393
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
Connections to atomwaffen division

394
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
We mentioned earlier the Southern Poverty Law Center

395
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,239
Which is this group non-profit group that tracks hate in the US and I think worldwide

396
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
What do they think about this

397
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
How

398
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,127
Can we fight it I guess

399
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,479
So they actually told us that I'll never wear them as well

400
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
Norman spear who is the founder of the bass

401
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,319
And the bass

402
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
And they said

403
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
After that it's

404
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
It's tough to know exactly what they're doing

405
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
But they were there were incredible resorts in terms of

406
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
How they saw the base

407
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
And what the cultural reference

408
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
What the

409
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
Historical

410
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
References were that the base were used

411
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,471
And how dangerous that was

412
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
Very much playing with things like

413
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,103
That Timothy McVeigh was inspired with

414
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,687
Yeah this is the Oklahoma City bomber killed a hundred something people

415
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
He was also

416
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,807
Veteran of the Desert Storm operation

417
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
It 1990

418
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
And we also knew that there were

419
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
Members of the base

420
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
Who are saying I was a veteran

421
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
And I served

422
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
One of them even said

423
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,047
I know it's like to kill women and children

424
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:12,959
So the Southern Poverty Law Center was extremely aware of the base and was tracking it and that's who us

425
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
It is an organization that

426
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Is all over

427
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
The far-right

428
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,335
Space

429
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
Editing criticism

430
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
But that said

431
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,063
The fact that they knew what it was or was it to us was okay

432
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
This is a real thing

433
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,159
You know it and I just said I kept seeing

434
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Since

435
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
February 2018

436
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
I kept seeing Norman spear everywhere

437
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
With these accounts

438
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,167
Yeah I mean we talked a lot on motherboard just about the role that platforms

439
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,727
Display in sort of amplifying and

440
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Helping people

441
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
Conjoined be sort of like

442
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
Far

443
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
Extremist movements

444
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
And

445
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:55,455
It's crazy that Twitter was allowing this to happen

446
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,855
For so long like you're tracking them for months and you mentioned the article that they didn't take down the bases Twitter account

447
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
Not until after you asked

448
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647
In about it

449
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,255
So I mean do you think that Twitter has any handle or any idea

450
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,047
How its platform is being used

451
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
In this way or

452
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,679
Are they just ignoring it or are these people using Code words to like

453
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,495
Talk about this earthing or is it happening in the open

454
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,847
I'm pretty shocked that it stayed on Twitter for as long as it did

455
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
Because some of the stuff was pretty insane like I think there's no way that Twitter didn't know about it the only

456
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
Anything that I would suggest

457
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,319
Is that Twitter Captain open

458
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
Because the FBI one of them to keep it open

459
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
BFDI

460
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Watch it

461
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,183
NC was involved with it

462
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,999
Because as a terrorism reporter

463
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
These accounts

464
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,327
Before I find them

465
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,375
And when I find them incredibly

466
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
It begins the mapping

467
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Of course

468
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Right

469
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
We talked about

470
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
Few times about the parallels but

471
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,639
Between the base and Isis and Al Qaeda

472
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,687
And how they sort of

473
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
Lake Mirror each other a little bit

474
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,319
And I know that in 2013-2014

475
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,159
Isis was doing a lot of like propaganda videos a lot of I mean

476
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,719
They posted beheadings on Twitter and

477
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
YouTube

478
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,047
I know that atomwaffen division has also produced

479
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:19,679
A lot of videos as well I mean are there is there video is there probably end up coming out of this or is it something that's

480
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,959
Still largely relegated

481
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Chat rooms

482
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
No video

483
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
But definitely a lot of

484
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
Photo

485
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Propaganda

486
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
Was coming out of the stuff that was actually done

487
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
By somebody who is

488
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
What's graphics

489
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,271
Who knows how to

490
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Use

491
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
Photoshopping weight

492
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Simplistic

493
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
If it were me

494
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Making it

495
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,463
But absolutely never also

496
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
That was one of the moments that

497
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,767
We thought was

498
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
It was interesting

499
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,327
Process we are watching this chat room

500
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
They were pictures of

501
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Meetups

502
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
And then

503
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
The next day

504
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,703
Come back out

505
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
And it's more of the propaganda photo

506
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
Stylized embossed dialyze embossed

507
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
Terrawave is what they call it

508
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Style

509
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
Terrorwave

510
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,247
What's interesting looks like atomwaffen division

511
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
They have

512
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
I mean

513
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
List of people that are

514
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,879
I know how to use these pieces software

515
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
The graphic designer

516
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
Annie play

517
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
With

518
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,791
All the motifs in the imagery

519
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
That

520
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,119
Isis absolute play with their

521
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,655
They have it they have a book club

522
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Where they read Siege

523
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,567
MCV beingness Neo-Nazi apocalyptic

524
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,895
Incredibly vile piece of writing

525
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
About a really

526
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
Vicious race war

527
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
Slash Guerrilla War

528
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
Carried out by neo-Nazi

529
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
By James Mason

530
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
That is

531
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,903
The Bible about a muffin today

532
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:44,927
Right

533
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,255
So you did a giant investigation

534
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
A very good piece of Journalism

535
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
Service monitoring

536
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
What the base is

537
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
What is the neck

538
00:20:53,887 --> 00:21:00,031
Step for you as a reporter or like what happens now I mean living kicked off some of these platforms but they clearly still exist

539
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,335
It's definitely be continued

540
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,687
There's a lot of information out there that we're Gathering

541
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,479
I would also say that

542
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,015
Both Mac and I have eyes in the

543
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Entire movement

544
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
And we were looking at it very closely

545
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
I think

546
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
You know

547
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
You mentioned the 2016 presidential election

548
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
This is something that's really obviously a lot of

549
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
People biking on a

550
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,792
The real thing

551
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
The

552
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
Election of Donald Trump

553
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,448
While some of these people openly that we observe do not like him

554
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
It is Galvanized

555
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
This entire movie

556
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,544
In a huge way

557
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
Because

558
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,360
Now you should have mainstreaming

559
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
Some of the same opinion

560
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
50s guys

561
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Hold

562
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,272
Except they're not as

563
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,064
Extreme belill sanitized

564
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,624
A little sanitize right stuff at the border

565
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
You know the Caravan

566
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,952
This is something that the base people

567
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,000
Realize was kind of b*******

568
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,792
But also they hate image

569
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
They hate

570
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,352
From South America

571
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
America coming to

572
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,448
You know but the other thing I remember as well is that

573
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,752
These groups that have been galvanized by Trump

574
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
Also consider the government

575
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
The ultimate

576
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Ultimate

577
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
As new Nazi movement and far-right movements evolve

578
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:14,272
When the evolve to the government is the enemy and it is a moment

579
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Guess Chelsea

580
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
Said this

581
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
When that happens that's when violence

582
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,416
Take place when real things have

583
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,720
And you know for us

584
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
We guys are not on this

585
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,304
And we're in a container report

586
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:32,960
So we mentioned that there is all this literature about how to make guns how to make chemical weapons and bombs

587
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
But they also talked about

588
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
Reusing

589
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Yunnan military grid

590
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
Bombs and weapons

591
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
From World War II

592
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
Yeah well and this show is it

593
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,736
Bass really wanted to be

594
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:49,344
You know we wanted to cry out all Neo-Nazi movements NY Power movements Milton

595
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,696
White power movement into one group where everybody could serve be outside of each other

596
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,488
And not have to

597
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
Engage with one another

598
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
Opinions

599
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,352
But also unites in the one

600
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,144
Fact let's make this

601
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
World

602
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
More white

603
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
And more militant

604
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Let's go to war with Society

605
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,312
And part of that meant that they had followers

606
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
In Europe

607
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,152
There are a few members who were discussing

608
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
How

609
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
You could dig up

610
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
World War 2 munitions

611
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
In

612
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Germany

613
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
Pacifically

614
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
And create ID

615
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
The mighty style bombs

616
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,440
And how they should pass

617
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:30,816
This information off to some of the people they know that are in the base where in Europe are the European Brothers in

618
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
What's the actual term

619
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Carefree

620
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,448
Which is a wildly

621
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,264
Insane concept because people actually die every year

622
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
In

623
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,104
Germany the stuff is still active

624
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
If we drop so much on

625
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
And stop just goes off

626
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,992
It's such as goes off like in a farmer's field

627
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:54,112
You know so that was pretty wild when we read that because that's also something that you know

628
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,160
I know Taliban is done

629
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,536
Digging up old Soviet Munitions and strapping them two barrels putting nails and screws inside of them and then

630
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,584
Convoy us comprehensive boom

631
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
Mass

632
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
Destruction

633
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,704
So yeah I mean this is the kind of stuff I was engaging with

634
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:13,312
The last 3 months and also stuff like that you know we left a lot of things out that are

635
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,128
You know, typical of white power websites

636
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
You know stuff like they're discussed

637
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
Killing

638
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
Black

639
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
Babies and eating them

640
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,088
And that you know it was a joke but like you know

641
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,464
After wild the stuff gets to you you're reading and you're just like this is so hateful what is going on in the world

642
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Sialic

643
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Shout out to my ex

644
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,840
Search my girlfriend hurt a chonce kefir

645
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:41,728
Keeping me company in disguise

646
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
Yeah that that's so

647
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,056
It's very upsetting

648
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
Yes I mean

649
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
Done with a lot of reporters like this

650
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,664
Sweethome json is kind of

651
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Reporting where

652
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
Your rings. Constantly

653
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,040
And you know I'm sure Joseph

654
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,064
Addison

655
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,368
Lorenzo you're just reading stuff it's just

656
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,904
Painful hateful

657
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,232
What's something that I've talked about a lot with academics

658
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
To say you know

659
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,560
You have to be careful that you don't

660
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
Like that you take your own mental health intake

661
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,680
Consideration when you're reporting on this sort of thing and that

662
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,496
A lot of people go into this thinking it's joke

663
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:21,152
And suddenly like they're radicalized and I'm not saying I haven't said reporters but I'm saying it's very bad for your like mint

664
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
Mental Health

665
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:24,736
To be reading this her stuff all the time

666
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,016
Be careful on

667
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,600
Oh yeah I mean I think it's like you go into it thinking

668
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,648
You're putting on this and it's

669
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,232
We all had this I mean a lot of people I know is that I work with

670
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
Lorenzo Joseph

671
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,048
Who

672
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
You going to be like wow I really wanted

673
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,144
Storage brake needs to watch when you're not sick

674
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
Isis whatever

675
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,288
And then you start doing it and it starts to break your heart

676
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:53,920
Because you get a really Grim view of just how hateful people are towards one another

677
00:25:54,176 --> 00:26:00,320
And when I was in the belly of the beast in the base it was like that it was she knows it's a deeply upsetting thing to read

678
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,136
Constantly has people after taking their days

679
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
Talk about digging up

680
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,464
Munitions

681
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
The murder minorities with

682
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
If this is

683
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,608
Wow the insane

684
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
Yeah yeah

685
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,496
Well it's a really good piece I think it's important to sort of
