1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,392
Eagle one package being delivered

2
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,184
Is a Hollywood trope

3
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
But it's real

4
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,560
And thanks to the internet of things sometimes you don't even need to hack the car directly

5
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:41,472
Packer that goes by the Alias L&M found a way to hack almost 30,000 accounts of people use to GPS

6
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496
Tracking apps

7
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:47,360
By taking control of the accounts to hacker not only access to users personal information

8
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,920
Putting names emails and home addresses

9
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
He also gave me ability to kill Lorenzo

10
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
The two GPS tracking apps are called pro track and I track they're made by two Chinese companies that not only

11
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,464
Excel physical Internet connected GPS tracking devices

12
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,280
But also the apps to monitor the cars

13
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:10,144
In other words it's the internet of things inside a car with default passwords

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
What could possibly go wrong

15
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
Has This SUV drives down the highway these two hackers are

16
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Pulling off the unthinkable no matter what happens don't panic

17
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,296
Even turning the wheel

18
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,904
Today we're here with motherboard reporter Lorenzo franceschi bicchierai

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
About this hack

20
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,000
What's really sound like a rejected script from a Black Mirror writers tape

21
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
I did not go and this

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
Decipher

23
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
Florence you got a bit of a scoop

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
This week

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
On

26
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
Something and I think a lot of

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,944
Security researchers at least in the lot of people

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
AR student

29
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:56,736
Because

30
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
It's sunny we all use cars

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Car hack

32
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
6.11 what did you find

33
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,416
Yeah so a couple weeks ago

34
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,208
A hacker that I've been in touch with

35
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Here and there

36
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,840
Message me saying hey I have to GPS tracking companies

37
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
And

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,680
Not only I can monitor thousands of

39
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,264
Cars all over the world but I can also like killer engines

40
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
Headed Hilder engine

41
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:26,432
Yeah and initially my responses like okay you're full of s***

42
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
But then I

43
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,528
I talked to him and I you know I talk into this

44
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
Story and yeah I mean

45
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Probably

46
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
He was telling the truth

47
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
So what happened here is that

48
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,024
He was able to figure out a way to hack into the accounts of

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,864
User than customers of these to GPS tracking companies

50
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:49,472
One of them is called the protract the other one is called I track

51
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
They're both

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,616
Owned by larger Chinese companies do not relate to each other but

53
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
The platform of the use

54
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,712
Is the same we don't know exactly why but

55
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,528
Probably that the same third-party provider of software

56
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,320
But anyway the guy

57
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
NACA figured out that

58
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,696
Every customer as a default as a password of one two three

59
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Four five

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
6 which is like classic

61
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
Don't do that password

62
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
It's so dumb

63
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
And so

64
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,936
So you figure that out and then he realized that he could

65
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,496
Use the API for the two apps

66
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
To essentially Brute Force

67
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,568
Or gas

68
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
All the usernames

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,152
So we just fed the API with a script

70
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
And

71
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
Like randomly

72
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,808
Tripe every username you could come up with a rather is program

73
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,832
Could come up with

74
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
And try to login with the default password 1 2 3 4 5

75
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
This way he harvested

76
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
Besides

77
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
Around 30000

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
Accounts

79
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,376
Which means not only he got the information that the

80
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
Users are within the Earth

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,728
Pounce but he also logged in as them

82
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
So we could you know check out

83
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Their fleet of cars

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,152
And these apps also give you the ability to

85
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
Stop the engine

86
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
The way it works is that

87
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,296
Let's say that which is by the way one of the most

88
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
You know typical

89
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
Car hack worst fears

90
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
Almost like equated to

91
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,512
Getting access to the power going to turn the lights out this is like

92
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
Getting into cars

93
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,071
And killing their engines

94
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,119
When you're on a highway or when there

95
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,655
When they're driving in the street

96
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
Yeah that's kind of like

97
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,495
Probably one of the nightmare scenarios eating pussy right

98
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,823
It's cuz we talked early it's like one of the craziest

99
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
Apocalyptic things

100
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,431
Yeah like we see any movies you know it's starting to be like a

101
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
Like a troll before hockey movies or

102
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
Act like Fast and Furious I think at a car hacking the last movie

103
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
Am I ready for this

104
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,463
I want every trip with a zero-day exploit in a 2-mile radius around that motorcade now

105
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,279
Is over a thousand of them

106
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,911
So in this case the hack was not that dangerous as far as you can tell

107
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,775
Because the way that this works is that if you have Lexie a fleet of cars

108
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
So you're like a

109
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,871
Company that sells floors or you have a

110
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
A cab company

111
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,783
You can buy GPS trackers like actual physical Hardware devices you put them in your car

112
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
And you connect into the engine

113
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
So these devices are now

114
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,927
Some of them at least are connected to the internet

115
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
So both the company that got hacked ER

116
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,535
Not only provide the app

117
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
Apps are they also provide the higher

118
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,911
So you buy the GPS tracker in selling your car

119
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
And if you want you can connect it to the end

120
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,519
Andy apps

121
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
Allow you to stop the engine

122
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
If you want

123
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
So like I think that the use case is

124
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,223
The driver tries to steal the car or the car gets stolen

125
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Cats lost whatever

126
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,599
The good news is that at least for one model that we

127
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,135
Wearable to verify

128
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,487
You can only kill the engine if the car is going under 20 kilometers per hour

129
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
12 miles

130
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,607
That was kind of the case as well with the fact that you're the same as wired

131
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Story

132
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,911
About car hacking

133
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
What's Charlie Miller

134
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,775
Connect to kill the engines at

135
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Like a hundred miles

136
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Broward

137
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
Yeah I don't remember

138
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
What was the limit thereby

139
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,479
There was definitely some sort of Fail-Safe or limitation that

140
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
Made it a little bit less bad

141
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,135
Yeah it's still I mean it's still kind of creepy for sure because

142
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
Incredibly

143
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,255
This whole story is

144
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,815
Makes people think twice you know we're not going to be

145
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,631
What are the point where cars are

146
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,447
Going to be increasingly on these types of Networks

147
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
Know that we have

148
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,567
The Advent of smart cars that are just going to drive us around

149
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
This is

150
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
You know what

151
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
Only a few years away probably

152
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
Yeah

153
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
Probably end

154
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
And even without like

155
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,087
Self-driving cars like we probably don't realize well first of all we don't realize that

156
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,463
Basically cards right now even you know what the card you got at Zipcar or whatever hurts

157
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,791
Those cars are essentially computers with wheels

158
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
And that doesn't mean that you should like

159
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
Freak out and think of you.

160
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,983
Someone is going to hack you while you're on your honeymoon or something but

161
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
It's still something that we need to

162
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Grapple

163
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,895
And something that manufacturers need to grab

164
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,967
Listen to that credit the major car manufacturers

165
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
I've been a lot of work

166
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
Securing their cars

167
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
I see how they hide

168
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,623
Sakura researchers date you know they created

169
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
Security teams that did not exist before

170
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,583
But the problem in this case and the story was that it doesn't matter what color you have if you install one of these GPS tracking device

171
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,631
Slices and you use one of these apps

172
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Then

173
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
It's kind of a supply chain hack

174
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,983
Ride like this guy hack

175
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,799
A third party that was inside this car

176
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,223
And even though it could probably not kill anyone likely and you know who is credit hacker said that he never try

177
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,063
Try to mess with the engines because that was not what I wanted to do and that was dangerous

178
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,647
But even if you didn't even if it was not able to do that

179
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
He could like track

180
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,975
Cars all over the world

181
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
And

182
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,303
Let's try something you don't want to do is if you have a

183
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,607
You know why these companies that uses Wireless app

184
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
So

185
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,263
I mean it's kind of scary that today there's like companies that ship software

186
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,823
With 1 2 3 4 5 6 has password

187
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
I mean that's the response of

188
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
Amazing probably responsible especially when you know infosec communities is shamed users for doing stuff like that

189
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
Let alone

190
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,319
Actual companies that create

191
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
What are you thinking

192
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,975
Yeah it's insane I mean it's 2019 guys like you cannot

193
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,023
You cannot expect users

194
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,303
To change their password

195
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Without

196
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Telling them to

197
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
I mean

198
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
I think we

199
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,447
Spoke about this in the podcast before like

200
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
The industry blames victims

201
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
Too much right

202
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
And in this case

203
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,919
Will you could say wow this is the user's fault they kept her default pass

204
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,527
That's not I mean the real problem is that the company allowed them to keep it if

205
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
I like the way it should work is okay

206
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,135
Maybe when you create the account

207
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,719
You give them one two three four five six for whatever reason I mean

208
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
You shouldn't bet

209
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Even if you do that

210
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
Then Force

211
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,143
A change of password after one day or I don't know right away

212
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Like something like

213
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
I mean the question becomes like

214
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
Where's the quality control

215
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:21,151
I mean it seems like the reason I contacted both companies and one of them did not respond to

216
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,175
Are emails

217
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,735
And the second one immediately went on the office

218
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
Which is a red flag

219
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
Right away like do it like

220
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
Why are you contacting our users

221
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,159
Are you involved with the hacker

222
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
Everything is fine and it's like

223
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:37,279
Guys like really in 2019 during urine come at me

224
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
For this yeah and you know maybe there was something Lost in Translation cuz they too Chinese company so I don't want to read too much into the Earth

225
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
Tone of an email like you and I was an email but

226
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
He definitely seemed a little bit like

227
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,335
Who are you why you asking all these questions and

228
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
Are you working with the hacker inside

229
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,711
No, first of all

230
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Sit down

231
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,039
Like your uses are in danger right now

232
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
So maybe you should worry about that

233
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
So yeah mean

234
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,695
Going back to your question the quality control was probably nonexistent

235
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
I guess I'll just this whole

236
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
Hack makes you wonder

237
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,119
How realistic is that mass hacking the future of

238
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,423
The cars that are going

239
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
Over 50 miles per hour in

240
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
You know killing the engine

241
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:23,871
But how possible is that going to be is it a science fiction as we like to think it is

242
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,919
I think in my opinion.

243
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,711
Very unlikely unless

244
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Allison company does

245
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
Something really stupid

246
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
And I'm saying that it's unlikely because

247
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
Think about iPhones for example

248
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,951
Like we talked about this end up in a podcast a few weeks ago

249
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
Like you can hack

250
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
IPhone

251
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,583
Looks like no one is denying that and you're going to be able to hack cars and

252
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,887
You know that's always going to be eight

253
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,935
Possible because softer will it bogs

254
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
And Packers will find his bags and exploit

255
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,335
But one thing is to hackmon single-car and one thing is to like

256
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Target thousand

257
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
So for example

258
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,967
We haven't seen a warm

259
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
Like a virus warm

260
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
For iPhone

261
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
We haven't seen like

262
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,855
Massive Attack

263
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
For iPhones

264
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
So if car manufacturers can

265
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
Take that model

266
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Replicated

267
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,327
Then they'll be able to limit the damage

268
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Which is to say again

269
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,167
Probably someone will get

270
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
Killed by a hack

271
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,495
In a car one day

272
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
Or maybe already have

273
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
Probably we will not see like

274
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
Hundreds of cars on the same Highway

275
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Like

276
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
Getting their engines killed all at once

277
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
Like I think that was actually

278
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
The plot of

279
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Right

280
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
I mean I remember there was

281
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
It was all these conspiracy theories

282
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
Back in 2013 when

283
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,023
Journalist Michael Hastings

284
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,559
Is cards

285
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
People saying you know

286
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
This was a car hack

287
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
Is conspiracy to kill him by the CIA

288
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
I would definitely I would not want to plan to

289
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
Conspiracy theories

290
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,103
Pukaar hacks are possible

291
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,687
Yeah I mean we saw it with that famous wired article and video

292
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Like

293
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,527
Those guys are Charlie Miller and Chris valasek

294
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,599
Just took a cruise

295
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
Jeep I think it was

296
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:16,767
They started it and figured out that they could not only monitor like cars in real time

297
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,607
They could take advantage of a bug in the system to

298
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
Kill the engine model cars

299
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
And

300
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,239
The letter that insane video where

301
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,799
Andy Greenberg is driving down the highway

302
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:34,687
And they start playing music on his entertainment system and you know it's all laughs and then

303
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,271
Without telling him they killed the engine while he's

304
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Crying on the

305
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
On the highway

306
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,575
So

307
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,647
And yeah that was sort of a controlled hack

308
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
That was

309
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
What could happen

310
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,255
Right like that was not a stance that was not

311
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
I'd there was a bog

312
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
That was fixed

313
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,351
Eventually

314
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:59,775
The bad guys could have found it to you know you just got lucky that I mean who who is this who is this hacker

315
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
What's what you done before in the past

316
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
He attacked a bunch of a

317
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
A couple of

318
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
Stock companies before

319
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,015
He doesn't want to say where he's from or who he is

320
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,319
He only goes by L&M Hawaii

321
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,879
So it seems to be kind of like

322
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
A random Park

323
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:19,231
In the sense of humor just a guy who likes to hack stuff

324
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,559
His methods are a little strange because

325
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
Like in this case it reached out to

326
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,935
The company's inside hey I found I hacked you

327
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,007
Do you have a reward for me like a set of a bug bounty

328
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
We should not have bug bounties work like

329
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
You can't pack companies and then ask for a bug bunny

330
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
Lockridge animal

331
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
Did the company sent him

332
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
And the company was like

333
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,575
We don't have that much money and can you give us a low price

334
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,647
Which is ridiculously funny as well but also

335
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
Kind of sad because

336
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
Again like these companies are used by thousands of

337
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
And

338
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
But probably very sensitive stuff you know like

339
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
Cabs or whatever the

340
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
The cars in there

341
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Their trucks

342
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
So

343
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
Yeah do you see this up a pack

344
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
Increasing the next few years

345
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,311
I think so because

346
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:10,431
Again like I think car manufacturers are doing a decent enough job so far

347
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,711
That's also

348
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
We don't know exactly how good they are

349
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,063
Right cuz it's all this is bringing you

350
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
Cars even used to be connected to the internet

351
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,463
GPS trackers did not used to be connected to the internet with like Android app

352
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,767
So the chances that

353
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
There's some companies out there

354
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:31,679
Cutting corners and Binoo using third-party developers that have no security training

355
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:38,591
It's pretty high I mean these things what might happen here like this to Chinese companies Outsource the development of the

356
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
The app

357
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
And did not realise that

358
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,943
Whoever developed the app

359
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,015
Was shipping it with a default password that

360
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
And one can Gastly

361
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Literally anything else

362
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Progressive

363
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
He was mentioned in the

364
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
API

365
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,975
The question is to is

366
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
The connected Hardware that could

367
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Come with

368
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
A car that is smart

369
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,631
As well right like it's not just necessarily

370
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
Biggby

371
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:06,239
The engineering of the software in the vehicle as much as it is

372
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:10,335
If third-party apps that come in and say hook this up to the car and it can do this

373
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
Where's the quality control on Van

374
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,967
Yeah I mean it's it's it's both hardware and software like

375
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
If you think of a car as a

376
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
Computer on Wheels then you have to think about okay

377
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
Is this car getting update

378
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
How is it getting on

379
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
How long is it going to get

380
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,975
It's cuz you know like

381
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,279
We change phones every 2-3 years

382
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,815
We can computers ever

383
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
A few years

384
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,143
But people keep cars for long time

385
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,727
So as these cars are getting connected to the internet are they going to

386
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Keep getting

387
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,263
Security update

388
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,823
For how long I mean that's the question right

389
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
If I'm buying a car that's connected to the internet right now

390
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,455
Is the manufacturer committing to

391
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Patching it

392
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,271
And if yes

393
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
For how long

394
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,087
Will I have to pay for the patch or not

395
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,391
And if I have to pay for like the updates

396
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
Maybe some people will not do it

397
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
When you drive an automobile today

398
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
You are driving a big computer system that happens that wheels and a motor in the case of the wired article and

399
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
That famous car hack

400
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
The car manufacturer

401
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,943
He should patches I think in that case they sent out actual USB keys

402
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
Two customers so that they could update the software

403
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,807
And that was I think

404
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,367
That was the first time that something like that it happen

405
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,927
And but where can I see more and more

406
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
In all your iPhone gets

407
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231
Updates

408
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Arie

409
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,327
One or two months marlesta mean it's not regular by like

410
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,887
Every year obviously there's a new job paid but

411
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,935
Throughout the year you got updates

412
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
As you go

413
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,103
You know you wonder if the government's going to get involved with Superman dating some standards because unlike yourself

414
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
Blow up when you're listening

415
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Jenna Liddell

416
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,479
Trump blow up on your head

417
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Kill you

418
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:57,855
But driving in a car is Samsung

419
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Best Buy C

420
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Price Samsung user

421
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,815
But yeah you know what I mean it's it's true

422
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Like

423
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,959
A car can kill you in a lot of great points like you know

424
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
Computers and phones

425
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Again today

426
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Gizmos

427
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:23,199
What's the worst case scenario I mean obviously you got hacked it can be bad right depending on where you are you can lose all your money

428
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
Iron Man games

429
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,039
Yeah but here were talking about something that like

430
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,343
Life or death

431
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,159
Another question is as well you know you say

432
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
You said earlier like oh

433
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
Probably

434
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
This won't happen unlikely

435
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
But then

436
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,399
You look at something like the Boeing crashes

437
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
That just happened

438
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
And these weren't hacks but

439
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,799
This was software-related saying

440
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
And

441
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,919
The company clearly it looks like at least the allegations are

442
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
That it really was was

443
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Short cutting

444
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,063
A lot of things in order to

445
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,855
To sell these these

446
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
Des Plaines quicker

447
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
So you know what

448
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,951
How quick does not happen with

449
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,487
With cars it's something to think about

450
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,887
Yeah I'm at mean maybe I'm just being optimistic or skeptic or you know I'm putting too much faith into this time

451
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
Can corporations in the hope is that

452
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:21,055
You know these are companies with a lot of money so hopefully they understand the risks

453
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
And they understand that

454
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,407
You know even does one person dying from a software bug

455
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,687
It's a huge cost

456
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:31,551
So just think about how much bad press Uber God when their self driving car crash

457
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
And kill someone

458
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,599
In the US

459
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
Is that worth

460
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:40,255
The extra software development that you need is it worth you know the security search that you have to pay

461
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
I mean

462
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,863
I think so I mean obviously I don't have the budget and I have a company

463
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
It's easy for me to say but like

464
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,727
Again we're talking as you said we're talking about life and death

465
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Like something like this is a PR nightmare

466
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
You know like

467
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,967
Somebody's iPhone getting hacked is a something is a PR nightmare that you can control right it's not that bad

468
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,783
I like somebody's car getting hacked and then

469
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,855
Dying or killing someone because the brakes don't work or something

470
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
That's

471
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
Like me know that's

472
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
Krampus

473
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
News for today

474
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,023
I mean call me crazy in a Luddite or something

475
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,375
But you know we're not going stuff happened it did make me think

476
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
About how willing we are

477
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
Select software

478
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,055
Overtake the human operator and smoothies very key

479
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
Places you don't even like it's

480
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:34,271
Trust technology understand technology and it's going to get better and better we're even the human operator will be

481
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,855
Will be out match but in these early stages it seems like

482
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,183
We are prone to these these lapses and

483
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
In the actual

484
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
The mechanics of this

485
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:49,631
This type of software yeah definitely end to go back to the story we don't know exactly why

486
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
This password was

487
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Set

488
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
2 1 2 3 4 5 6

489
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,079
My explanation and I'm guessing I guessing or speculating is that

490
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,151
Simply

491
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,455
It's the simple way to do it right like

492
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
You just give

493
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,319
Every user the same password and that way you don't have to

494
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
You have to pay for some password

495
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
Generating yeah I don't know it's just it's just makes it simpler right so so if you're cutting Corners like that

496
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,095
Those are the risks and I just said yeah like

497
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,263
Especially the beginning one where you know we're putting the internet on this devices and maybe we're not thinking about it it's very

498
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:33,663
The problem is that I don't think things are going to get necessarily better as we understand the technology more because

499
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
The more we put softer on this

500
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,271
You know machines like

501
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
Cars or even airplanes

502
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,159
It's got more complex and with more complexity that will be more bugs

503
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,463
I'm with more boxed it would be my hat

504
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
So

505
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,303
The key to all this is to really

506
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071
Think about

507
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,655
Why you want to put like the feature that you want to put on your machines

508
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,703
Very carefully like Tijuana

509
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,007
You know do you want the

510
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,847
Plane engine to be connected to the internet like probably not like

511
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,895
I can't think of a good reason right

512
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,175
So

513
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,991
Yeah same thing with the car engine

514
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
Should be connected to the internet

515
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
I don't know

516
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,135
Like why would it be unless it's a self-driving car and

517
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
You want to take it over to remote

518
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
Even in the case of like a stolen car like

519
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,816
I mean I understand that killing the engine in that case can help but

520
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,984
I don't know it's still like what are the trade-offs ride like I'd rather not have the Internet connected to my car and

521
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,848
And accept the risk that if you get stolen I might I may not find it

522
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
Well I'm at gloriously happy note

523
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,200
I think we can end the podcast

524
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
Thank you

525
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
Lorenzo thank you for having beer

526
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,880
Interviewee have a double hat today

527
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,440
Just Shameless self-promotion episode

528
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:55,840
Yeah yeah yeah that's actually paid you to love me on the final

529
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:02,240
Naughty suggested it

530
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:08,640
This week's episode was recorded by John northcraft

531
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:14,272
Headed by Sophie cases produced by Lorenzo franceschi begin and hosted by me

532
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:19,136
Will see you next week
