1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Eagle one package being delivered

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,048
A daring plan to meddle in American elections attempt to get Donald Trump

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
The White House it was happening before eyes but few people suck coming and even fewer we will

4
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
The Russians use internet trolls fake Facebook accounts and hackers to drive a wedge to the Humira

5
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
Can people from ending America and around the world became like a shot in the dark disinformation

6
00:00:54,272 --> 00:01:00,416
Something we thought was just a cold warrior Relic was back and back big time since then

7
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:05,280
Congress has held multiple hearings on how to counter disinformation campaigns

8
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
Facebook Google when other Tech Giants have shut down thousands of fake accounts and called out

9
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
And American spies

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,616
Back back more than two years later we're also trying to figure out exactly how the Russians did it

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
How to get ready for 2020 do we even understand the problem real Schoenberg is the director of intelligence

12
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784
Research

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,624
Celsius Advisory Group a consulting firm based in the US

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,024
Schaumburg his colleagues research and simulated tax but not just limited to the Cyber domain teltik us

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
Understand what a real-world information operation looks like

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,288
So information operations tell me how does this fit into

17
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
Quote on quote

18
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
The cyber

19
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
Well fiber is a part

20
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
Information operation

21
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
And I think

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,224
That first week

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
We kind of have to disentangle

24
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,808
. right because we here to term

25
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
Information operations

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
Throwing around a lot but

27
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,440
Really what we are focusing on currently

28
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
India Public debate

29
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
Is influenza

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
Like we talked about

31
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
The social media aspect

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,352
Make a call

33
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
Amplification

34
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
But that is really good

35
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
The influencer part

36
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
All information operation

37
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,544
So information operations is actually

38
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
Broad spectrum

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,616
Where cyber or offense

40
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
Defensive cyber operations just

41
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Small Park

42
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
Right Thursday

43
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Psyop part

44
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Thursday

45
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
Electronic warfare part

46
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Etc etc

47
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,416
So we basically have a misunderstanding in the public domain

48
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
Of what we're actually dealing with

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
Cuz we are focusing

50
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,560
Strictly on that social media aspect

51
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
Not just that we're also folks

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
Kissing on it in the very packed

53
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Nicole way

54
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
Information operations

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
Have to be looked at

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
In the morning strategic fashion

57
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
So

58
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,872
In that one year timeline 5 your time at 10 your time line

59
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
Which is something we're not doing it all at

60
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
At the moment

61
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Right End

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,528
At the same time information operations

63
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
In that strategic science

64
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,112
AR

65
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
Very hard to quantify

66
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
It's all qualitative

67
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
Write how do you measure influence

68
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,072
I mean not to think he says especially when you look at

69
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
You know

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,888
Mini golf in the room

71
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
The DNC hack

72
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
Podesta Etc

73
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
I mean

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
How much did that actually affect

75
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,592
Jimmy

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
You can't quantify but the only thing I can say is

77
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
That information operation

78
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,272
That influence operation it had some effect

79
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:40,672
Right so what I found very interesting is that it took us a very very long time in the public domain

80
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
To figure out that the DNC hack was not more than

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,304
Supporting operation of Greater

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
Plot

83
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
If you will

84
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
I thought so

85
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
Whitby 10 to look at all these things from

86
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
Very narrow vertical

87
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
Right so

88
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,104
If you have a cyber background you kind of look at okay

89
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
This target

90
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Was hacked

91
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,944
Maybe dorsum implants

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
Maybe something else happened and that's kind of the

93
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,552
The area that you can find yourself

94
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
Easy 20%

95
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Thank you you

96
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,160
Kind of look at an actor

97
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
You kind of look at Melissa's domains etc etc

98
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Not as easy to graph

99
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,911
That influence part and how one domain influences another

100
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Domain

101
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
Right as much

102
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,983
Harder

103
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
To disentangle

104
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,543
It takes a lot of effort

105
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:34,175
On everybody's part okay so then give me an example of how does a how does a larger operation

106
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
How does that look because I mean

107
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,295
If you're looking at it from an exit is it really what it comes down to his ass

108
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,111
Essentially

109
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:48,511
I'm not sure Espionage is that the right way to look at it but it's certainly a game of intelligence and Connor until

110
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
Our sacred sacred

111
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,863
It doesn't necessarily have to be statecraft and

112
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,727
The greater scheme rights not just our major adversaries like Russia and China

113
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,543
I think since 2016 musina raizel

114
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,615
Not just private team but also political operatives right

115
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
2016 Regatta results

116
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
How you feel about it

117
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,735
I want your thoughts are on

118
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,087
It was a watershed moment where a lot of people realized

119
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
Owee

120
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
We are fighting for hearts and Minds

121
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,743
Forget about all this kinetic stuff that's like dangerous and

122
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
No cost a lot of money

123
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,607
We realize we can just use small Nimble teams

124
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,911
To try and influence a Target demographic

125
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
I think that's

126
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
Where get more complicated because

127
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,031
We need to

128
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
Distinguish fact

129
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
And a conjecture

130
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,383
Right

131
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,223
So if you want to understand information operations or the influence part of it

132
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Write a ghost

133
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
2 motive and intent

134
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,879
All the particular actor what are they trying to achieve

135
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,231
So that that an intelligent perspective goes beyond

136
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Attribution

137
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,303
Right is not just figuring out

138
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Who shot

139
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Who fired

140
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
The gun

141
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,239
But it's also who pays for it and what were their motives

142
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,871
Right. So that's much harder to figure out than simply oldest person fired the weapon

143
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
And that's what we have

144
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,991
So if you want to figure out motive and intent

145
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,015
And

146
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,159
The adversaries estate actor that means you need to have visibility in how that stayed actress thinking

147
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,975
Commercial entities I'm going to have that capability

148
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
And

149
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
4D

150
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,583
State actors who do have the capability

151
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,167
Once they have that capability they don't want to give it up

152
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,263
So I think that's part of the issue for it the US government

153
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
Psych what do we know and what can we say publicly

154
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,431
The USG doesn't want to venture into the speculation and conjecture area too much

155
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
But

156
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,551
If they can somehow prove hey this is what the actor was thinking

157
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,367
Then the actor knows all we've been compromised one

158
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
One way or the other

159
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
Which you know

160
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
It's not good for whoever's watch

161
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,071
Okay so you're saying that obviously this cyber aspect of it or some of the influence

162
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,399
Operations that occurred likes you know the DNC hack it was

163
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Supporting

164
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
This whole operation

165
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Wlppr

166
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
Familiar with that hole

167
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,823
You know Russia tried to steal the election kind of

168
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
Merida that we keep hearing

169
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
What was the operation walking through it

170
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
Well

171
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,783
Again it's a very hard to say with certainty right because it's conjecture

172
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
More soda than dealing with facts

173
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
What I think we need to

174
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,719
Reevaluate is that this

175
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,023
Wasn't about an election per se

176
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
It's about it

177
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Weather

178
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,631
A campaign targeting the American people

179
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
Write the election result itself

180
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,751
Did not necessary matter for Russia

181
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
But it's about amplifying

182
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
That you know discontent

183
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,663
I'd it's a long-term operation

184
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,199
Don't know if you've heard of a

185
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,479
Yuri bezmenov

186
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:51,551
Was the KGB Defector righty defected at the

187
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
The late 60s

188
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:57,183
And in the mid-80s he gave the TV interview which can find on YouTube

189
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,023
And he basically talked about you know strategic demoralization

190
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
How that's a decades-long pro process

191
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,399
Program right and then that information is

192
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,447
Half a century off at that point

193
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
So

194
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Free

195
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
Factor in all this

196
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
You know

197
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,151
Yale research all these new technologies that easily create Echo Chambers

198
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,711
Write Facebook Etc Google

199
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,039
A very easily create custom Echo Chambers for

200
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,575
For anyone

201
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
Right through targeted advertising

202
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,159
All that good stuff

203
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
That

204
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,719
Fire Apparatus

205
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
Really allows

206
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
Foreign adversaries to influence

207
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Us

208
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
At scale

209
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
Nowadays

210
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,911
It sounds like there's some sort of relation

211
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Stream the Russian government unless

212
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
I'd say

213
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Allegedly the NRA

214
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,823
Is that what you're kind of saying you're you're trying to create

215
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
Chaos within your adversary

216
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Or the Tiger adversary

217
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Mistrust

218
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
Its own political system

219
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,039
Is that when you're dealing with it on a global

220
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Level

221
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
Their weekend

222
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:03,487
Right the way I person look at 2016 is was a continuation of a long

223
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Perm

224
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,071
Systemic attack against her

225
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
Institution

226
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,679
Right and we weep now basically mistrust everything

227
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
If you look at censorship

228
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,311
Right we can look at the Russian mob and you can look at the Chinese model

229
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
Chinaberry

230
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,687
Thoroughly controls what information is available to its citizens

231
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Directions

232
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,783
The date don't have those constraints

233
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,063
To the same extent

234
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,415
From where I sit I think the Russians learned after the Cold War

235
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,511
That if you very narrowly confined information available

236
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
To your

237
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,303
Population

238
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
Then they will trust

239
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,935
Whatever information is not unit is outside of that

240
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
Supply chain

241
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
Right so if

242
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
When people listen to voice of America they trusted

243
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
So in the long run

244
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,895
You know for oppressive regimes

245
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
They start realizing

246
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,455
If we

247
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
Filter out

248
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
Any kind of descend

249
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:02,111
People who do not trust the government will trust that dissenting voice

250
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
Sophia simply you know

251
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,951
Let everything go

252
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
All these different opinions

253
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
Or facts

254
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
Are allowed in the public domain

255
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
Then how you determine

256
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
What is fact

257
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,751
And that is basically one of the big fights that we effectively have going on right now

258
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
How do you determine what is real

259
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,871
When there is a million Echo Chambers out there

260
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,687
All you know is having that unique answer

261
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:29,503
That is suitable to to you and your Target demographic

262
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
That is the

263
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
Long-term scary Park

264
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
From a societal perspective

265
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,695
I need some else to do with you no are you familiar with surcouf

266
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
I'm not sure

267
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
He was a Russian czar

268
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
Political theorists

269
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
Putin's henchmen

270
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,655
Created this whole idea of

271
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,215
I actually had a background in performance art

272
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,775
Yeah sorry was your pronunciation

273
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Threw me off

274
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
Surah kahf

275
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
He essentially says

276
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
Are you create

277
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,455
Mistrust

278
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
Between all political

279
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,527
With Anna Target

280
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,855
Rights over for Putin what it was

281
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
Was the Kremlin would directly

282
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Finance

283
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,975
Both left and right

284
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Wing parties

285
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
And organization

286
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
To have them

287
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Fight each other

288
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,935
When then the obvious answer to all this the only person that you

289
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,983
You trust him it's all is chaos is a

290
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
Strongman

291
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
Like Putin

292
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,871
Well it's a you know anything is possible nothing is true

293
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
Rights of wonder

294
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
Trust at that point

295
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
Right and then it really

296
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
Start revolving around your Echo chamber

297
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
Right at and you will

298
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,183
Just accept whatever information is given to you with an echo chamber

299
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:46,815
I know if you kind of trying to translate that into you know all the social media that we are absorbing

300
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
I mostly through our smartphones right

301
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
A lot of it is about agitating

302
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
A person

303
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,103
But can you believe that this just happened on that point you are you know what happened

304
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
Right right there.

305
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
It's not about you know sides

306
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
Just getting off

307
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Everywhere

308
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:11,135
I didn't want to find yourself you know when to add jatate it State you become more susceptible to whatever messaging

309
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Somebody's trying to feed you

310
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:13,951
So

311
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
I'm in the long run

312
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Fact is

313
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,327
Is really one of the fights that would that we have to fight

314
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,423
And looking at investigative reporting some of the reporters that we

315
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,751
Talk to this started to realized as removing more into

316
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,567
A data or information based reporting

317
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
Rather than just

318
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
Talking to people

319
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
How do we trust open source

320
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,711
Sprite substitute high-back to cyber

321
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,039
How do you trust something that that you find on virustotal

322
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,135
Right Wit Me Assume everything that's uploaded to virustotal

323
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Is trustworthy

324
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
Uploaded by

325
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
Somebody who just found something interesting

326
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,839
But what if somebody starts poisoning that well intentionally

327
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Right and you can

328
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Therefore seeds for

329
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,471
Right because people go through virustotal

330
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,055
This repository of all these different binaries and other stuff

331
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
No mostly malware but

332
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Alex Lewis

333
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,383
Oblique

334
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,687
You can basically plant historian

335
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,247
People basically dig through a dataset

336
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,599
They find something out this is interesting maybe this actor tried to

337
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,903
Target that particular Target

338
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,719
But how do you verify that actually happened

339
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
How do you know that

340
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
Somebody didn't put that

341
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
There on purpose

342
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
That maybe frames North Korea

343
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
Or whoever whoever

344
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,007
What do you do in this face what it what is your job with your company

345
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,591
Well in our company we basically

346
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
Whitney deal different clients

347
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,431
So some clients realize old

348
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,015
We are a long-term Hard Target that realize

349
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,831
All week we are dealing in the complicated space

350
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,647
We are starting to see reputational attack

351
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
Right we are being manipulated

352
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
And how do we counter that

353
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
Or you staying at their dear

354
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,863
I fall apart from something else that happened

355
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,423
That that mean not directly tied to them

356
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
But still they realize order something going on

357
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:06,335
So we offer both Services as well as training as how do you

358
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,663
It and how do you defend your information supply chain

359
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,967
Right in that information supply chain

360
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:17,855
Affects both you know the way you consume information or the way your systems consume information as well as

361
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
How do you produce

362
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
Information or news

363
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
When it comes to Newsroom

364
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,791
How do you

365
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
Verify the integrity

366
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
David step

367
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,167
Where in this information supply chain

368
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,471
Exists the possibility of influence

369
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
AR

370
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
Observation

371
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
What do you do to Connie tell them like this is what you

372
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
View

373
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,943
Nono isn't it goes Way Beyond a tweeting tweeting is

374
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,295
Not really on our radar I guess to some extent it is but it's not but it's

375
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Looking at

376
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,879
If if let's say it's Newsroom

377
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
It's like

378
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,719
We started having some conversations

379
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,303
About you know how are your reporters being influenced

380
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,607
So some of these conversations go

381
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
Are no longer just

382
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Oh watch out for that malicious

383
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
PDF

384
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,055
But watch out for you no sourcing and all that kind of counterintelligence

385
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,407
People that are kissing you know the story of The Washington Post actually caught

386
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,991
The people trying to sell them as a fake story right so

387
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
That's basically that the shift

388
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,879
That we have to undergo from a very

389
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
You know

390
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Tools based approach

391
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,279
Like I use this piece of antivirus and you know that protects me from

392
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Malware

393
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
28 more

394
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,167
Pronounce long-term Conger intelligence program

395
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,263
Are you trying to figure out you know where are my weaknesses and our people actively

396
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,543
Lee trying to exploit us

397
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
It almost sounds like you're selling like

398
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,943
Counterintelligence to all these people like how to actually spot being

399
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
Being manipulated but also

400
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
Being used as a source being

401
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
You know I mean

402
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Something like

403
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,231
And we don't know for sure who the motor for hasn't come out but there could have been an opportunity or chance that

404
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,023
Wikileaks was like an onion

405
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
Unwitting

406
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
I said

407
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
2

408
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
Allegedly the Russian

409
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
And they were given information that they then

410
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Disbursed

411
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,007
Two larger

412
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Public

413
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
Is it stuff like that

414
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,639
Do we have to be aware of where the

415
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,431
From my perspective the reporter

416
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,199
You kind of

417
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,991
You will always

418
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
Especially if you're getting government information

419
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
You think why am I getting this

420
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
Why am I being fed

421
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
Right yeah I mean it's

422
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,255
Basically what it comes down to how do you do Connor and Telugu

423
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
Smart and actionable manner

424
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,351
How can you figure out you know

425
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,655
I was trying to Target you and in what ways

426
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:45,311
So what you're saying is in the Modern Age there were in right now in 2019

427
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,151
It is so volatile the way we consume

428
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
And fling information

429
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
That we now need

430
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,087
A new way of interpreting it and accepting what facts are

431
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
We can't just

432
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,415
Sort of Take One Source even one new store in

433
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Here we are

434
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,999
I think that's very much on the mark

435
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,583
Right we we have to as a society we have to rethink

436
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
How do we consume information

437
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
Cuz

438
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,775
What was effectively happening right now is we're trying to consume information real time

439
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Are the adversaries have you know dear cyber capabilities or whatever you want to call them and they can feed that disinformation

440
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
At machine speed

441
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
Fact-checking happens at human speed

442
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
That's a losing proposition

443
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:33,951
Writes it so hot how do you deal with that and applies to a newsroom also applies to a financial right if you're a hedge fund

444
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
You know how do you trust an information that you and Jeff

445
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,607
Or you think about artificial intelligence

446
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Okay

447
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,911
Okay you get all this data

448
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,471
How do you verify that it's actually good data

449
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
So

450
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,823
Especially in in some of the sectors that don't have as much

451
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,151
Experience with adversarial data whatever you want to call it

452
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,455
Right or adversarial influence

453
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
How do you know

454
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
Kind of reconfigured the lens through which you look at

455
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Damn

456
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
We are in a hole

457
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:10,047
I'm here in a whole heap of trouble I have to tell you cuz I don't have you been on Twitter lately you seen it

458
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447
I was on Twitter this afternoon and I could feel myself getting agitated this like this is not good in that nightclub

459
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,031
Used to be that people would call Twitter a hellscape

460
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,055
And it would be like

461
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
Integrate word hellscape

462
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,199
But now that I see people call Twitter a hellscape I'm like that's not even

463
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
Close to what it actually is

464
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
It's so much worse than that I mean it's

465
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,855
It's fantastic in a lot of ways

466
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
As a source of

467
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Information gathering

468
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
But it's also just

469
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,231
Usually represents

470
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
I think

471
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,559
The worst of humanity

472
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,887
Ingested information and

473
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
You know

474
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
The return cycle it's

475
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
Like

476
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
Go on there sometimes and I'm just like

477
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:00,223
Right and then whenever you feel that agitation that's When You're vulnerable to influence right as the Soviets said agitprop

478
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,759
Agitation and propaganda

479
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,319
Kind of bird the foundation if you were

480
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
Yeah really is now

481
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,951
Itsfunneh somebody asked me this recently they said but what about the US

482
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
The us do this

483
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,559
Are they good at it cuz it seems like the Russians have been

484
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
Pretty amazing at this for a long time

485
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,423
Yeah from where I stand I don't think the US

486
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Is particularly good at it

487
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:26,079
I think intelligence States like Russia and China are just inherently

488
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
Better at it right cuz

489
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
You grow up in that environment it's what you know

490
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,527
It's all very cloak-and-dagger and it kind of comes natural to you

491
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,367
You know all this subversion cuz you're not you're not very surveillance state where

492
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
Where intelligence

493
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Is capital

494
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
Right exactly cuz it's a you know it's

495
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,535
I mean I wouldn't call Russia a totalitarian state but I think

496
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
China at this point is

497
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,607
Pretty much.

498
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,215
I think it's fair to call both of them intelligence date

499
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,823
Right and one that is the environment in which you grow up you haven't

500
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
Very different way of

501
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
Of of looking at things and

502
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Looking at

503
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
How information flows

504
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
How you know

505
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
To do this thing that scale

506
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,831
Have you ever heard of the protocols of Zion

507
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
Of course which is

508
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,439
Which is crazy because it's literally was the first

509
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
Real

510
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,047
For people who don't know what it is it was essentially this

511
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,959
Meetup conspiracy that was created by something called the oak Rana which is essentially it was a czarist intelligence

512
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,799
I am it was probably the first really truly

513
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,847
Sammy modern intelligence

514
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Agency

515
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
They created this

516
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,199
Complete garbage anti-Semitic

517
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
Pamphlets

518
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
That

519
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
Describe this

520
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
Jewish conspiracy

521
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
Conspiracy to take over

522
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,159
And it was spread Wireless

523
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,183
Still want you

524
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
To this day by some people true

525
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
It's insane

526
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,839
I mean that's that's an important operation

527
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,191
Again going back to pizmon of

528
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
Hayden rezanov

529
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
It is that right 85

530
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,151
Percent of the KGB was focused on active measures

531
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,687
Right on another

532
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
What's something that was

533
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
Repeated by other defectors

534
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
Later on

535
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,855
Right so 85%

536
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,440
Was focused on the influence operation

537
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,792
Psyops or whatever you want to call them

538
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
In the US

539
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,608
How God I mean doors

540
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,912
Dirt dirt dirt or so many

541
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,936
I think it was a

542
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,960
The stuff about

543
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
Fake news about

544
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,312
Our disinformation I should say about

545
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:38,688
Churches being burned down in the South and I think the Clinton admin actually yeah

546
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Issued a note on

547
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
So

548
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
That's how high it went

549
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,832
Are how high can go

550
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Enough

551
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
It's constant

552
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
Right but it's

553
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,232
It's no longer just about feeding you false facts

554
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
If that's the term I should be using

555
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
To begin with

556
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,120
It's not just about feeding you this information right it's about

557
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Genji

558
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,448
Trying to constantly remind you lately

559
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,240
Tok what is fact what is fiction

560
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
And making it harder for you to

561
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
You know distinguished

562
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,384
I mean it's really insane to because

563
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
You get this world right now where

564
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,736
The term fake news is thrown around by Avril

565
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Everybody

566
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,784
I mean

567
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
It's wild like

568
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
Soccer players

569
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Fake news

570
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,416
Analysis story

571
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
Politician

572
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Actors

573
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
Everybody

574
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,560
People cultural significance

575
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,376
And it's it's so widespread

576
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,912
I think it's become

577
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
Not so much

578
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,472
That is actual fake news

579
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
But

580
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,312
It's now become I don't like that news so I called fake news

581
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,408
And that that's part of the that's part of why I don't work so well

582
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,760
Just to think about it in different ways that one of the Prime directives off prop

583
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
R6S

584
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
Propaganda is

585
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
Propaganda has to be total

586
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,928
You have to be confronted with it all the time

587
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,952
Right

588
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
So not now

589
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
I get to blast like

590
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,376
2 years or so we've just been hearing about disinformation fake news and all sounds

591
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Very terrible

592
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,960
So not now we're slowly trying to

593
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Bu Force antutu

594
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
Idea of hey we need to legislate

595
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
Problem away

596
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
Which

597
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:15,200
When I started talking about this problem or actively back in 2015

598
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,760
In the lead up to 2

599
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Do some stuff

600
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,344
I was like this is the long-term strategy

601
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
Holler adversaries

602
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,440
Nick that they will want us to train Legend

603
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
Just laid our free speech

604
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,536
We will see that some sort of tactical victory

605
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,584
But in reality will be a strategic

606
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,352
Defeat

607
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,424
So that is I think where we really need to

608
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:41,312
And I'll start thinking about hey how do we do any of this stuff without curbing

609
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
Are free speech

610
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,408
Cuz if you start curbing are free speech.

611
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
You know

612
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
An American

613
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
Right and there's a lot of conversations

614
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
About

615
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Free speech

616
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
That I think are

617
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
You know

618
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,464
Are you with a lot of crazy s*** with free speech though it's

619
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,304
Batman is Ernie true but I think about it and I'm going back to

620
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,632
Decide decide think about spam or malware right

621
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
It's

622
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:13,312
How do you legislate that problem away we haven't been effective for the last know 20 30 years of Mesa

623
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,360
So think we can legislate this problem away

624
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
And the other thing then to consider is that

625
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,528
Foreign intelligence agencies aren't going to care about our laws

626
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,344
They're going to do their thing they're going to be undeterred

627
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
So what are you actually

628
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
Attempting to fix

629
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
Who are the big players

630
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,512
I mean obviously we got rushing mean they're one of the biggest

631
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
It's not the biggest

632
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,840
China who else

633
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,912
Iran is becoming has become more active

634
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:44,032
You can even try and look at some of the stuff that North Korea has put out is an interesting way of

635
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
Trying to position themselves

636
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
Right

637
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:53,504
Again a lot of it is conjecture right that burden of proof goes beyond attribution it's about motive

638
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,552
And intent how do you figure out

639
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
Why somebody says something

640
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,416
Write two people could say the exact same thing

641
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,464
But one could be you know

642
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,768
Well intended in the other person could be

643
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,304
You know up to no good

644
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
So simply

645
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:11,936
You know looking at it a lot of stuff is being said on social media isn't that

646
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,008
You know doesn't give you that clearer picture

647
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,848
And the other thing is because everything is so out in the open

648
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
It's very easy

649
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Or

650
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:27,296
Actors to basically look at whatever disinformation campaign DC on social media and comp

651
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,880
Right and then repurpose it for their own agenda

652
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:34,464
I mean we say that US government has no it is not very good at this

653
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,768
But I was probably the best of manipulating

654
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
Unpopular

655
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,352
They look at something like the way right now

656
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,376
They're selling this

657
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,192
This war in Venezuela a possible war in Venice

658
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Escuela

659
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
And it's pretty wild

660
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
You know

661
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
So the way I look at it is that

662
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
Targeted advertising as basic

663
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:57,248
Sickly allow direct messaging from anyone in the world to a particular Target demographic

664
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,088
So the idea from that say 50 years ago that a state

665
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,160
More or less had a monopoly on messaging

666
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
It's

667
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
It's people

668
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,512
It's it's it's population

669
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
Not that notion is

670
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,584
It's gone with targeted advertising

671
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:16,960
So what are you saying today you're saying it's not just us government doing this you're saying it's probably likely

672
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,752
Some of the interested parties

673
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Who are

674
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,568
Trying to spread Pro and paid

675
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
Venezuela propaganda

676
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:26,432
I guess I'm not talking about

677
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
Venezuela at specifically

678
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,064
I'm just saying targeted advertising gives everybody to tools

679
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:37,184
To do targeted agitprop right well I'm going to read between the lines there

680
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,584
Cuz I mean New York Times debunked at this video of

681
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Burning Convoy

682
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
But it was the

683
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
The Maduro government that I've done it

684
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
And then

685
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
Turned out now actually was

686
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
With the opposition

687
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,824
With Molotov cocktails

688
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,640
And you know these were images spread around by

689
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
Major US Government figures

690
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,528
As almost like this pretext of how brutal this Madhuri

691
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,064
Not to say that the

692
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,904
Regime is infertile but you know going to invade a country

693
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
And it's

694
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,696
Sovereignty

695
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Is

696
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,000
You know this is a much larger question

697
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
But

698
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
You know they did that

699
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
The Iraq War

700
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Look at the way they stole that

701
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
You got some US Government classified

702
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,264
But it's

703
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,080
Again about motive and intent

704
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,640
Generally speaking right what water

705
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
What is the

706
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,992
Historically the message that the US has

707
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,552
Does tried to convey is you know little boy

708
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:39,648
Liberal democracy and all that good stuff right has been generally about freedom

709
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,720
But let me put it differently the work we do is agnostic

710
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
Right

711
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:46,304
Wake me simply look at hot how are

712
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
People being influenced

713
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
And that's kind of

714
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
Hour or cyst

715
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,240
And that's kind of word starts and ends and

716
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,800
You know I'm not here to talk about what

717
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,848
You know the us or any government

718
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,384
Has been doing

719
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm here to visit

720
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,504
You don't look at this impact on society

721
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
And

722
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,832
Look at how we

723
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
You know consume information

724
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,696
Rethink how we do that

725
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,000
So which I think we've got a serious problem with

726
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
Right right

727
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,584
Right out how do you do reporting

728
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,888
In a place where people are actively

729
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
Retargeting sources

730
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
I mean how do you

731
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,752
How do you create truth

732
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
In a society like this

733
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
What's so fragile

734
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
Like how do you actually do that

735
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,920
We'd like to think it was much simpler

736
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
4

737
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
But I think now

738
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Seeing a Fallout

739
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,296
From that particular election like

740
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,088
You put it at the watershed moment

741
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
Whether you like whatever happened or whatever outcome

742
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
We have to accept that there is some sort of

743
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,048
Yeah War Friday it but I think the biggest one is obviously

744
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
A War facts

745
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
Right it's

746
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,216
It's War facts and it's a war about not just facts but you know

747
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
Institutions that you believe in

748
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
And that is

749
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
Very difficult

750
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:05,664
To comprehend I think as it is a larger demographic right we obviously have an interest

751
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Send it

752
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:09,504
In this particular topic and

753
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,320
Want to figure out how we are being manipulated

754
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,856
Enough for a general audience

755
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Instead they don't think about

756
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,184
Things right I think we're getting there though

757
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,256
You know I think people are starting to see that manipulation

758
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,328
Looking for example even the sort of this

759
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Suddenly we have

760
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,656
Public discourse about

761
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
Billinghurst

762
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
Possibly wrong

763
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
Right liquid

764
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
And these are things that

765
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,336
We're starting to see

766
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,384
Sort of these these Global contacts

767
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
Of manipulation and

768
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,456
Powerful institutions

769
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
Right and also I think

770
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,832
Outlaw that has to do with

771
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,624
What happened in the last 4 years

772
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
Right around for years

773
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,952
2016 even before that I would say

774
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
And I think it's

775
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,256
It's changing

776
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,280
Our perceptions

777
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,840
Yeah our perceptions are being reshaped

778
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,120
Entirely

779
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
Righttime

780
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,912
And some of that

781
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
Mike

782
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
Expose power structures that we

783
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,264
We weren't familiar with

784
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,080
And some of that might be too

785
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
You know

786
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:11,712
Influence was in a bad way right if you go back to bezmenov Etc

787
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,272
It's all about how do you make the adversary

788
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Think

789
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,856
In a way that they are going to do something that is

790
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
Is good

791
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
For you know

792
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,184
Somebody else

793
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,256
Right how do you get somebody to act against their best

794
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
I am in that matters

795
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,096
That is the core of

796
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
What we're dealing with that a

797
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,424
At the global scale

798
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:35,008
Give a good example of how maybe cyber with combined

799
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,288
Effectively with

800
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,312
And influence operate

801
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
I think the

802
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,152
Best example to date is

803
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
Notpetya attack

804
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Back in the 20

805
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
T17.

806
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,296
Primarily affected Ukraine

807
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,856
But spread well beyond Ukrainian

808
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
And it basically

809
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,904
Western Logistics

810
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
Supply chain

811
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
So that was a

812
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,768
A piece of malware that

813
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,816
Pretending to be ransomware

814
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,632
But there was no way to recover your data

815
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,960
Do all these machines that were getting hit by notpetya

816
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,752
Eyewear non-recoverable

817
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,336
So it basically created huge havoc in the Ukraine

818
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,664
But it didn't stop there it is attack is being attributed to

819
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
To GRU

820
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:21,088
And in 2017 we saw at notpetya and notpetya post itself as a ransomware attack

821
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,368
Tackett was being pushed

822
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
Through app

823
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:28,256
Tax software that is a very popular in Ukraine and bite

824
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
People or companies

825
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
To do business

826
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Ukraine

827
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,632
So it was pushed out as a malicious update

828
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
And as a result they say

829
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
Sickly anyone

830
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
I was using that piece

831
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,520
Softer by not picture which

832
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
Subsequently

833
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,848
I spread through all these Network

834
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
I know it was

835
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
The worm that

836
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,688
It hit all the networks of the

837
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
These companies that are

838
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
Are using that soft

839
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
So

840
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,088
Banks in the utilities etc etc were

841
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,416
Crippled in Ukraine but didn't stop there was

842
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
Also

843
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,280
You know Ukrainian business partners or whatever you want to call them

844
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,608
So some of those companies were major Logistics

845
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,888
Supply chain companies

846
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
That's on the leeward

847
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,728
Out of commission for a very long time

848
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Mark Mark

849
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
FedEx

850
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
In-N-Out

851
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
These major major companies what we're hit

852
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
And

853
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
What was interesting there is

854
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
The first element is

855
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,552
Deposes ransomware soda first

856
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
Wave of news

857
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,160
A new ransomware is hitting all these companies

858
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,440
What's going on

859
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:34,048
And the second wave of news basically a focused on the

860
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,096
Usage of Eternal blue

861
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,888
From the shadow broker leak

862
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,192
Basic set of one of the ways

863
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
Stop patches spreads

864
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,056
Is through here and effect thereof was

865
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,360
We basically sauce Rob Joyce

866
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:52,224
Then at the White House having to defend a say in its usage of these

867
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,064
Is after the the biggest Cyber attack in history

868
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
I did this was

869
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,160
Estimated that more than 10 billion dollars in damage

870
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,768
So I'm right at the point where there should have been major major push back

871
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,328
Underwest saying hey we condemn this

872
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
The pack

873
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,936
Instead the West Was more or less backed into a corner

874
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,216
The disconnect

875
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,288
Between a lot of intelligence agencies

876
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
Observe that attack and it

877
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,688
Fallout is very very different from how the news media and the average reader

878
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
Observed at follow up

879
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,784
It's effectively conjecture

880
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
I should point that out

881
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,600
But if

882
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,392
The gru have planned this

883
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,184
It certainly worked out very well for

884
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,256
Right just it it would essentially did was

885
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,536
It undermines

886
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,584
It support the West has

887
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
In Ukraine

888
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
While also

889
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
Effectively taking out

890
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
You know

891
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
Kind of machines in that country

892
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,776
And I'm sure

893
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
Weakening Ukraine

894
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Image

895
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
Business-wise

896
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Abroad

897
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
Nearby

898
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Isolating at 4

899
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,624
Right right so there's that and again that the US wasn't able to push back right tus Ojos hitter

900
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
Does well

901
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
But

902
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,720
Instead of pushing back saying this is unacceptable

903
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Write cos

904
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:13,888
Again. This was a destructive attack and I think up until notpetya all the major destructive attacks that we know

905
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,168
Like

906
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,448
The power grid

907
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:21,568
Write rain in Ukraine but but also you know that the hits against our

908
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,128
Saudi aramco or you know

909
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
How to replace the

910
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,736
They have all been confined to one particular company

911
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
Right

912
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,856
These were destructive attacks but it's extremely extremely Target

913
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,696
Vs notpetya which really spread far and wide

914
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:42,048
Right up so that that's a whole different set of norms that are

915
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
You know being transgressed

916
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:48,704
I thought so. You're needed to be a strong push back saying hey this is unacceptable

917
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,008
Cuz this is a major escalation from

918
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,800
Assembly targeting one

919
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
Particular company

920
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,128
And instead

921
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
You know wait wait wait

922
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,944
Would that the outline base

923
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
Simply said you know any

924
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
You know

925
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,808
Did that that they were anti-nsa witch

926
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,576
Again

927
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
You know people can be

928
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,696
People can have that view but it wasn't the right time

929
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,720
Does that make sense

930
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,304
Okay so last question

931
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,400
If you can give anybody some advice like

932
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
Common people right now

933
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:24,544
What would it be to sort of not being manipulated what would you tell them

934
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,848
I think I would start

935
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,872
It's saying that

936
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,408
Freedom of speech is

937
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
Extremely important

938
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,224
Sometime we can't give up

939
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
That up

940
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
To try and fight something that we

941
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,064
We can't legislate away

942
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
React we haven't been

943
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
Successful with

944
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
Legislating

945
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
Similar types of

946
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
Problems there's nothing

947
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
To suggest

948
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,256
That legislation will

949
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,328
Net positive

950
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,912
Secondly I would say use ad blockers

951
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,960
Target advertising is

952
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
One of the main ways we are being

953
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Manipulated

954
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,848
And a third I would say that

955
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,176
Read newspapers or or rather you know

956
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,456
Get your news

957
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
Fromm

958
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,064
Places that actually have time to do fact checking

959
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:14,976
Right so it doesn't have to be a newspaper per se but you know go to reputable places

960
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:21,376
I did not do in this week's episode was produced by Lorenzo franceschi because I recorded by William Flynn
