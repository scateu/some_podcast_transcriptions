1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Eagle one package being delivered everyday 1.1 million

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
People travel through American point of entry according to statistics from US Customs and Border Patrol

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,912
Almost 700,000 are people coming in by land of those numbers

4
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:42,752
Almost 300,000 coming by privately owned vehicles

5
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
The same time depending on their way in CPT gets fingerprints photos biometric data

6
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,760
Passport IDs and license plate numbers of all the millions of people who crossed the border

7
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,600
Which is why when motherboard reporter Joseph Cox reported in May

8
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
The hacker known as

9
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,416
Boris the bullet Dodger

10
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,232
Yes that's undoubtedly a snatch reference

11
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,256
First Supply

12
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,048
The bullet

13
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,632
His heart is the Hemet process

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,472
Just impossible to Kill the Boss 2

15
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,800
Said he'd hack a license plate reader company called perceptyx

16
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,128
Been posted a large cache of the stolen data

17
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
On the dark web

18
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
Now less than a month later CBP issued a statement confirming a data breach at Roberts contract

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,112
The details of which line up with

20
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:30,880
The Prosthetics

21
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,232
We can't confirm perceptyx was in fact the official breach

22
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
One thing is for sure

23
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
The news showed how your data

24
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,864
Did you willingly give up to the government

25
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,168
Can you hack and dumps online

26
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,192
Against your will

27
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,520
About the story we got mr. Cox

28
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,336
And motherboard EIC Jason Keppler

29
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
Discuss just how massive

30
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,688
Vacations for future data retention are

31
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
Just think about it

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,064
This story comes on the cusp of groundbreaking attempts by the CBP

33
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,880
Use facial recognition software

34
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
Along the border and

35
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,720
Collecting visitors social media information

36
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,536
That's we've got for today's very Big Brother episode

37
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,352

Two interviews at once

43
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,712
I'm very lucky

44
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,808
Milwaukee guy Marvel Round Table than anything around table

45
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
How much for Round Table atmosphere

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,416
So just about start with you

47
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
So we initially go to tip

48
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,584
On a Thursday morning or mid-afternoon from this hacker who killed himself

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
Which is completely a snatch

50
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Snatch refere

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
Yeah absolutely

52
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
Old English m

Gangster movies

54
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,640
To get this email

55
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
Reached berries of a company's before

56
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,784
Is pretty common nowadays to

57
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,112
Break into somebody's doing the date

58
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
So you can see Miles saying

59
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Becoming cool except

60
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,584
And they choose available on the dark web

61
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,168
And then we were posted.

00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Pizza Company

63
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496

Sting

66
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
In that involves the US

67
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
Evening directly because

68
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
Very good

69
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
What's with customers of this contractor

70
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
It was a pretty run-of-the-mill

71
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,160
Data breach

72
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
At the time apart from

73
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
Cookie Simpson

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
Information that round boulders

75
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,352
But that was it was kind of normal takes prehistoric

76
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
Did you know what

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Government Apartments

78
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,032
I mean in that other references

79
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,360
Did the DEA and Customs and Border Protection

80
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
Dino

81
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
This is so fly PDF

82
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
Ndia is not focusing

83
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,528
And then

84
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,880
What is a lot of reporters on Tallahassee and she went through and provided was this

85
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Contacts

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184

00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:20,095
License plate readers installed on their 60

90
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,167

93
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
Ryan that used to work with Northrop Grumman

94
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
As well which is

95
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Obviously

96
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Hi us

97
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,783
Military military

00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,063
Contract

99
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
But it's time we we

100
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,903
Like Joseph said we didn't really know

101
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
What was Indus

102
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,279
At the time did you contact Customs border

103
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
Troll

104
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
Various

105
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,727
People who would be affiliated with this

106
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,519
Contracted

107
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,847
As far as I commanded the only people who take it back to us was

108
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
An employee of the

109
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
Exid

110
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
On the

111
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,831
He says they on Friday I believe

112
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
Statement to Major Supply

113
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,183
Yes the breaches happened

114
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
Pending legal case

115
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
That was possible verification

116
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Thoughts

117
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
Then

118
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
There's nothing

119
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
Around 11

120
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,471
The core Services explosion

121
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,287
When CPP transition statement

122
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,383
Did you have to find it yourself over this and then I got sent to you

123
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
So the Washington Post reporter that

124
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
As well as

125
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
BuzzFeed TechCrunch in a

126
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,367
A couple other places but they all reported at the same time and it was a press release that's

127
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
He sent out

128
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
How to select

129
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:48,927
Shield

130
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Journalist

131
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
When you saw it

132
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
You thought yourself this is

133
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,119
Basically the Washington Post ran a two-sentence article that was like

134
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,911
He said that traveler

135
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Data

136
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Has been hacked

137
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
Installing

138
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,287
And that's all that's all it's that

139
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,847
And I was like oh holy s*** this sounds exactly like

140
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
Call Joseph reported a month

141
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,199
So I just was offline because

142
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
He is in a

143
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
Time zone and it was

144
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
Like later in the afternoon so I emailed cussing and barber

145
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Patrol and I said hey

146
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
Like what's going on here is this

147
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Perceptyx hat

148
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
And they send me the same

149
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
A statement that they said

150
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,511
Send to everyone else

151
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
And I think that's what

152
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Makes this very in

153
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
Interesting or it's not that interesting it's more

154
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Ascent

155
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
Not to do around

156
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,543
I act like this because it's obviously

157
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
Extremely sensitive data

158
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
Ncbp handle that in

159
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
I'm probably the worst boss

160
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Possible way

161
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Strike because

162
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
You read the initial statement

163
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
Matthew said they say that

164
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Well

165
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
Some hotties of stolen

166
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,903
License plate images and quote

167
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Triphala images

168
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Collectible

169
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
CPP

170
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
When you leave.

171
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
Statement

172
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,095
And basically the headlines rule saying that

173
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
Oh my God

174
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Customs

175
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
You got into quite rightly assume this

176
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,407
Quotes of entry into United States when your face gets kind and a single queen

177
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
And it sounds

178
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,247
Absolutely huge I mean to be totally honest

179
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,319
When is Jason said that it was late for me

180
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,415
I see a message and I come online

181
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:29,279
Initially I didn't even think it to the fact that sounded so much bigger

182
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,375
Turn the story when he published a month ago by the phrase and if the statement

183
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
And by leaving out

184
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
Who many specifics

185
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
It seems that customers really

186
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Blew up

187
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Significant

188
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
What is Northline

189
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015

190
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
Old is the information provided noshiko

00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367

00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Hackers from CBP and like

195
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,751
That's not what

196
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
ET sad but their initials

197
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Steven was so big it's a

198
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,967
Traveler images you know stolen from a sudden I come back

199
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,087
Yasso

200
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
And then they said that

201
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
The Traveler images

202
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,535
Nvidia Cuda

203
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
Do you have some specific

204
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,679
Points of the folder and specifically like to go free

205
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Lanzhou

206
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
Does traffic

207
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,543
Wow

208
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,591
This is like a perfect

209
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:51,199
Timers Festival why did they wait a month to damages find down for whatever

210
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
How do you say to this way to

211
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,295
24 hours to get the information

212
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
It would have been so much better

213
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
The clocks in some capacity

214
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
Additional statement

215
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:03,231
Significantly reduce the impact

216
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,839
Yeah I really want to know what's going on here because TVP has been

217
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
Pretty vague about

218
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
Just like the specifics of this

219
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,471
But it said you know on May 31st

220
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,799
CBP learned about a subcontractor getting hacked

221
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,103
I think we reported the story like

222
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:24,223
May 20-something they made the statement June 10th it's like

223
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,551
Why did it take them so long to gather information and then

224
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,647
Why wouldn't I be in the in the original statement because they sent a second statement like

225
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
2 hours

226
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,231
Where's later 3 hours later but it was already too late it was like

227
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,815
Washing posted renovada New York Times send a news alert like

228
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,375
It was out there and people are writing about it and

229
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
I'm not sure how much

230
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,079
Like I haven't really seen Congressman like we need to have hearing then sort of like having that hold next

231
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,151
Step of the new cycle happened but in any case

232
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,503
What were ultimately talking about here if this indeed was the perceptyx hack

233
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,575
Which CBP hasn't said that it was

234
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
But we

235
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
I think it is because they sent

236
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
The Washington Post a Word document titled

237
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
Perceptyx

238
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
It just bungle it's like

239
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,119
PR bungling and usually the way that this works is

240
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,423
A company or the government will say

241
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,519
Oh yeah like some data was stolen it wasn't that bad and then it comes out later like

242
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,919
Actually this is way worse than originally thought I mean maybe there bumble

243
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,711
The cover up a little bit of the damage

244
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,479
Control

245
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,039
And they're not really seeing the scope of this because mean

246
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
For me hearing this story

247
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
Yes is a journalist I hear

248
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
The two statements

249
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
For how much

250
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
F****** that was

251
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
Giving us

252
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
As journalist more

253
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Nation to go with and also

254
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
Making a story much percentage

255
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
But the fact that there's a company

256
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
That had

257
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,287
Private data of citizens in people going through the Border this

258
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,335
Miku gives their fingerprints

259
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
Knowingly to the US government for nothing

260
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,431
Right everyone I've done it

261
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:04,575
I'm sure everyone else is done at the country that border Global Entry

262
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
Yeah

263
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,791
So when we agreed to give information to the government

264
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,375
Neurocore

265
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Chocolate reasons

266
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
The US

267
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,751
That doesn't mean the date it was only going to be

268
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
With the cousins

269
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Right at school

270
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,663
A huge chunk is going to be with contractors and subcontractors in Dunedin

271
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Megabox

272
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,015
Exactly Manassa tell you this Joseph even though

273
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
The stuff you did on geolocation tracking

274
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
SIM cards

275
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,671
I mean this is something that you think you're getting up information

276
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
Knowingly

277
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Protected in

278
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,023
And it's going to trickle down

279
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,583
Yeah and even if you don't even know where it ends up

280
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
Could end up with

281
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
I'm you out these exact agencies

282
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,727
Are pushing for bigger and bigger

283
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,311
Powers midnight I was reading at CBP

284
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,615
Wants enhanced facial recognition

285
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:05,759
Spider-Man spider verse is getting better than old example now

286
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,807
YouTube how to remember that course

287
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,367
Snowden was working for Booz Allen

288
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,647
The company that employs

289
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:16,767
Edward Snowden this not the center of the US surveillance program leaks Booz Allen Hamilton

290
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:23,167
Is there a name technology consultancy firm domain client is the United States

291
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,775
They work with nearly every Federal agency from the Environmental Protection Agency

292
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:33,919
To the Department of Homeland Security another one of a number of private contractors who profits have exploded

293
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,527
Since the huge rise and US intelligence spending since the early 2000s

294
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
When we do have

295
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
Significant tysabri choose from

296
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,255
Intelligence agencies

297
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,279
Samsung

298
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,839
Humane Ohio

299
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,447
Will do

300
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,215
More than anything

301
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,519
Actually

302
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
How do you say

303
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
We just a truck Wheaton

304
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
Actually know where it's at

305
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
We've no idea and it's just

306
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,967
Its and it's shocking to me that CBP

307
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,271
With the statements we going back to the

308
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
Thea questions

309
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,063
These statements

310
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,367
How Cavalier they were at first

311
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
To sort of schluff it off

312
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Yeah and then

313
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
I mean what's

314
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,815
Well system traveler images and Justin Traveler

315
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,375
Less than a hundred thousand people that's a lot of people

316
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
Yeah I know I don't really know

317
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,239
What sort of cyber security

318
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
Investigative powers

319
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
You know

320
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
TVP has at the moment or this

321
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
Sophistication but clearly it doesn't seem that too

322
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,711
Sophisticated

323
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
What's going on here which I think is

324
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,271
Is pretty concerning

325
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,087
You know in that statement and initials

326
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Statement they said

327
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
You know none of this data is available on the dark web

328
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,207
And we haven't

329
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
Published

330
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,279
The store yet I'm not sure if

331
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071
We will get it by the time this

332
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
Podcast comes out

333
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:01,215
To be determined if there's a story on motherboard

334
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
About this

335
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,567
Then we did get it and if there's not then it didn't really work out but

336
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:10,431
This data the perceptyx data is on the dark web Joseph is downloading it

337
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
Tia Torres taking a really long time

338
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,783
And the file names in that

339
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,855
Play suggest that this data is on the dark web

340
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
So

341
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
It's either a different hack and

342
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,463
Play custom border patrol

343
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,047
Isn't saying who was hacked would you guys should say who was hacked

344
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,911
It's the same one and Customs and Border Patrol has no idea how to download anything off the

345
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,679
The dark web

346
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Or

347
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,287
The data that's on the darkweb is something completely different and all of the

348
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
Like what is what is the date on the dark web

349
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
Because

350
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
It's license plates

351
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
And

352
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
It's images

353
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
You know

354
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
It looks like it's from the border

355
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
Yeah I would just ask that of course we can.

356
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
When and how

357
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Want to publish this but yes

358
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
Downloading the data

359
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
Is troublesome

360
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,303
And if we going on the assumption that it is accepted

361
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,119
Is it good

362
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,775
CPP before they go to the incident response company in whoever that maybe he'll be a little more and I have the number of expertise Augustine

363
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,359
Maybe they simply did not know how to actually obtain Nastasia

364
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,759
Without going into specifics is not as simple as going to websites impressing download you have to use a very special

365
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
Traffic through tor

366
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Because of that

367
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,207
It takes a hell of a long time to download try to irrespective house Austria

368
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
CB said that was

369
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
Some specific information on the dark web

370
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
Looking at the

371
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Smile Direct

372
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
Released

373
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,495
It looks like that date

374
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Is the

375
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,591
Goodwill Seattle

376
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
It just also shows how Lucy

377
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
This defense

378
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
And surveillance

379
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,271
Contracting works the US

380
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,367
You know I keep a certain point you're getting these

381
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
The third-party contractors

382
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
I'm sure they getting paid quite High

383
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
And they can't control the data

384
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
But this is something it's so indicative.

385
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
The entire process

386
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,655
Government Contracting for very serious

387
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,007
Yeah I'm in a lot of these companies obviously they have people go through

388
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,543
Security protocols and gets

389
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Security clearance

390
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
This isn't stuff like that but

391
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Once it leaves

392
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
Is the US government like

393
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
You said it's

394
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
Not the safeguards are not

395
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
They're in the same way

396
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,831
CBP set at this company didn't follow

397
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,415
All the guidelines but I mean we don't know that to be the case

398
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,255
Could be very easily that this company just got breached the way that

399
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,327
Tons of supposedly secure companies get breech all the time

400
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
I mean here's a question for you mean

401
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
If we can say this

402
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
But this hacker

403
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
Do we know I know Joseph

404
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
She said

405
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
Does a hacker you know

406
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
Today hack similar types

407
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,991
The Targets in the past this seems to breach a whole slew of different companies that insure

408
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,671
When is the other targets completely covered with an internet infrastructure

409
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,487
Particularly popular in Germany

410
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
Shops

411
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:15,775
Companies

412
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,895
The Mandate when it comes to identifying and choosing targets I imagine

413
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
It's anything that happens to me

414
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
When they hatch.

415
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
German company

416
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:31,391
Full and then some of the company also told me that

417
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
Doctor refuse to answer any question

418
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
Antiseptic

419
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,143
Didn't elaborate time between extortion attempt

420
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Gibson

421
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
Packers preview

422
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,823
Activity I mean that would be my sis gasoline as much as I sit there like some stew Financial

423
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,919
Is this a case of a hacker dumping only a trickle of what they have

424
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
And trying to maybe get there

425
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
Company to play ball or

426
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Do you think

427
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
But they got to put it on low

428
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,183
I mean typically you receive small amounts online and then

429
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:10,815
Trying to extort more money that would make sense

430
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:11,839
Mike's Pizza

431
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
That is no

432
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
A song

433
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
Even 10 gigabytes

434
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
Material this is

435
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
So much stuff

436
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,639
Sure maybe they have some more but at this point it doesn't even matter

437
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
Ambassadors

438
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
Business

439
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,951
It doesn't seem like a sample

440
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:43,327
Ncbp is there any any question that they'll come back and give more information

441
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,679
Honest well I can email a wave secret about saying Hey look

442
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,495
You set the specific information was on the dark web

443
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,591
I believe it is there is some evidence and they do just

444
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,895
No comment on the

445
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,175
Austin

446
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
So

447
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
I don't see them

448
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:07,135
Initially being more forthcoming by again because I do

449
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:14,047
Is possible for any effects

450
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,863
People may not believe that was Alexa

451
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
Senator Ron Wyden asking

452
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,471
Inform the people who hides

453
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
Included in the states

454
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,359
We don't even know if the government agency that she knows that at this point

455
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:34,015
I do see them potentially issuing more information how helpful.

456
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
Is going to be is

457
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
Do you think this is at all

458
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,999
CBP is ability to then go to Congress and ask for water powers

459
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,375
I don't know I mean I'm sure some

460
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,983
Lawmakers may be wide enough his movie use this as sort of an example of

461
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:59,359
Hey if you want to expand Powers especially this is the sort of thing that can happen

462
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,223
The most convincing arguments in the world

463
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:04,991
To think about

464
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
People

465
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
Maybe to make sake

466
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,367
Because it is a useful case study 2.2

467
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
Yeah I mean I guess everything to is the world needs subject very closely

468
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,583
Try explaining this breach to somebody who's voting on this

469
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Who doesn't quite understand

470
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
Subcontracting

471
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Twista balance

472
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:24,959
Company

473
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
5cb

474
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
BP

475
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,591
Equal CBP serve wrongdoing I get to them maybe they'll think of

476
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
Add some more policy

477
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,687
Initiative to it and you can

478
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,503
Prevent this from ever happening given the face recognition powers that they

479
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,343
I mean I guess just remember

480
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
What you mentioned earlier

481
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,671
Ace Hardware

482
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
Even government Department

483
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,631
And I was there a debate tonight Correctional the program Society ends up alone

484
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
The end

485
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,471
Superuser little people caring for these food as well

486
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,543
You know what other countries that don't do this in terms of what state

487
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
Maybe in five eyes

488
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
NATO

489
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,967
That just kind of data to government departments

490
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
No as far as I know

491
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
I mean again

492
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
It's just a contract

493
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
He's such a

494
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
Voice of hearts

495
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,584
Because of course they technical know-how or the ability

496
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,656
It's going to be within the government

497
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
Governments don't go to Country

498
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,616
Because the contracts can do it cheaper will because maybe they have knowledge

499
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
Right

500
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
In this case

501
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,760
I can't really I don't want to

502
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
Speculate but

503
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
This seems like a

504
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,832
It's almost a

505
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Content

506
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
That's why I was

507
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
Do you want to

508
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Get that technology

509
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Reggie from that

510
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
Company

511
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
You know use

512
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
Will get yourself what if the subcontractor

513
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Using the

514
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,144
The actual License Plate Reader

515
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
And the information retention

516
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:02,240
That seems like something that can be easily

517
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:05,568
You changed attention when you coming through this

518
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,200
According to the CDC statement

519
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,016
The second one it was

520
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:20,416
Only one last month.

521
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
Hello longer

522
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Not long ago

523
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
Yeah it just depends how much these people collect bees

524
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
Of course if you don't collect

525
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
Certain pieces

526
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,056
It's not going to get breech tonight something to probably

527
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Companies

528
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Social contract

529
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,040
Aloha tattoo

530
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,880
Noah most of these types of companies that get rich like this do they pay

531
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,720
How to say I mean the

532
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
It does happen

533
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,048
Especially when it comes to

534
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
Snow White Witch

535
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
Marshmallow

536
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:07,008
Deliberately looks down a device sometimes

537
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
2

538
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
Hey are you

539
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,408
Toronto my role for down to try to take them out of the system

540
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,200
It's

541
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,248
Is difficult to say another

542
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,600
Another Hudson group

543
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,624
Face claims

544
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,440
The same

545
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
Another

546
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
Generate pressure

547
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,960
2% off Xmas tree Spokane

548
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
In a previous episode

549
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,008
So

550
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,056
Is apparently effective

551
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
Wechat don't show how much

552
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
EPay

553
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
Victims aren't really going to war

554
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
Will you think I'm taking his

555
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
Perceptyx maybe they got breach no way that was

556
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,040
Pretty difficult

557
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
To do

558
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
And

559
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,624
CBP statement saying that

560
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
They screwed up

561
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,232
I serve also feeds into this naming and shaming kind of

562
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
Environment of service

563
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
Security.

564
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
You know the minute a company gets

565
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
Breached we all

566
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
Kind of pointer finger and tell them

567
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
