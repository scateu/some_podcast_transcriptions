Eagle One

2
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:28,672
The package being delivered last year investors Port 5 billion dollars into cybersecurity startups

3
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,256
The whole industry will be worth 170 billion in 3 years

4
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
According to a recent estimate

5
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:37,376
There's so many investment companies it's hard to keep track of

6
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,400
Yet

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,936
Are we all really secure

8
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,752
Is the infosec industry really keeping us safe

9
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,568
And is it even focusing on the right problems

10
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,384
Next week tens of thousands of people

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,760
We'll meet in San Francisco for the year's biggest information security Gathering focused on business

12
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,040
Vrsa comprar

13
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,088
Kelly Shortridge

14
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:00,160
Is the vice president of product strategy at capsule8

15
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
New York city-based

16
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,464
Security startup

17
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,024
Kelly has a background in economics

18
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
Investment banking

19
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
And I studied infosec Market

20
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,656
She's here today to help us understand

21
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Why do you put 2nd Street

22
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,472
So big

23
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,008
And what's wrong with it

24
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
I've been a coup in this

25
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
Is cyber

26
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
So

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
Tell me about this

28
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
Overly inflated

29
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,808
Cybersecurity Market

30
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
The place

31
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
Yeah it's

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
Pretty nuts ha

33
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
There's a huge problem right now

34
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
In the information

35
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
Security industry which is

36
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
Is namely that

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
These startups are an actual

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
Play solving

39
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Problems that

40
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
Security practice

41
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
Kissner's house

42
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
Are mostly chasing what

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Buzzwords

44
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
But also problem

45
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Apolis rather than the

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Relief

47
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,784
Jamie was the most buzz-worthy we talkin like

48
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
You know

49
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,904
Synergy corporate Synergy like that kind of thing buzzworthy infosec

50
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Market

51
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
Earlier today actually

52
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Published the

53
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,000

Teen Edition of my

55
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
My infosec

00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Bingo card

57
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Included

58
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Automation

59
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
Comprehensive

60
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Actionable in

00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216

ReThreads

63
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,776
Intelligence

64
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
I'm trying to think of others

65
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
Scalable

66
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:28,224
Scalable wantaddigest here constantly

67
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
This is the never stop

68
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,392
Exactly exactly so when optimizing so is a joke

69
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,488
Your price is an optimizing something what are you even doing you don't actually have to

70
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,048
Say like oh we're optimizing 4X

71
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,328
You just have to say it soft

72
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Becky

73
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
Sudo militaristic term

74
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,288
I think that's right I think it's appealing to a certain

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
Ego and maybe and I think it's

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
It's not

77
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,736
Perhaps an unpopular opinion to suggest that Security Professionals often want to see themselves as

78
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,296
Heroes in the organization story

79
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
So having these very

80
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
I like big

81
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,624
Powerful words

82
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
Can you know one for example is in power.

83
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
That inherently has the word power in it right

84
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,584
I think a lot of times there's the the challenge between

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,704
Security people off and being The Gatekeepers at these organizations will also frankly feeling somewhat helpless

86
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,240
Is there an able to get

87
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
What do they want done

88
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
Did you say

89
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
In the fact that this

90
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Is kind of

91
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
Parley's this

92
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,456
It's over-inflated nest

93
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,016
Is it creating problems rather than

94
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,624
Actually solving any is a sort of like a we looking like said this or the.com bust

95
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
On the horizon for

96
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
Cyber security companies

97
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,512
I'm skeptical that there's a bubble in

98
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
The fact of the matter is the most

99
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
The vast majority of startups

100
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,888
Spell and I don't think information security

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,520
It's particularly special in that regard what I will say is I completely agree it's causing more problems than its actual

102
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Play helping

103
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Nick very few startups

104
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,664
In the ecosystem were actually again solving real problems instead of their

105
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,480
Springside fear uncertainty and doubt to try to

106
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,296
Get the customer to believe that the problem

107
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
Set the solution to solving is worth

108
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
The time but it isn't actually

109
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,672
Then you have a bunch of shelf where all these

110
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
Tools that cost millions of dollars that people don't

111
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,024
And abusing or worse

112
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
It cost them

113
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
Countless hours of

114
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,215
Countless man-hours every month just to maintain them and nothing actually gets better

115
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,519
Are you going to name some names of the smooth company

116
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,103
I am not I'm gainfully employed by

117
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503
Actually a startup in which I actually believe so I wouldn't want to jeopardize any potential relationships there but I will say

118
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
Say if you hear

119
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Company is again

120
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
If

121
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,975
You're reasonably a tune to the security industry and you can't figure out what a company does from

122
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,303
The first half of the main splash page on their website

123
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
I'd be skeptical

124
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,631
And with your background

125
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,167
It's a bit unusual and it's

126
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,471
Perhaps why I focus so much on

127
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
Buzzwords in the actual dynamic

128
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:03,359
Exit the market in venture capitalist is I started my career in investment banking

129
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,175
As a mergers-and-acquisitions banker

130
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Recovering information

131
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
Security as well as data analytics

132
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,391
And then I started my own start a push was acquired and then have been in product roles on the security vendor side

133
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,439
Gone the way of my studies

134
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
A lot of the kind of Behavioral economics Dynamics

135
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
Of the industry and Thursday

136
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Bullmastiff

137
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,375
Misaligned incentives

138
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,191
So it it Blends pretty perfectly with looking up

139
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
The finance side of

140
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,263
Misaligned incentives

141
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,359
Okay we know where is somebody from Wall Street over here

142
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,431
How do you say I'm sure you in your in your past

143
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
You tried to find an efficiency

144
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:45,087
Yes absolutely so the economics term would be market failures

145
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
And certainly given the

146
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
High tension high risk

147
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
Nature of information

148
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Security

149
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:55,327
It makes people more prone to cognitive biases which is exactly what marketing people want

150
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,399
Right you want people to be scared he want them to be making these kind of

151
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,495
Fast unconscious decisions motivated by their emotions

152
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
Centos

153
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,335
Things like buzzwords there's a reason why people actually use them

154
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Likes

155
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,687
Like the the term cyber long ago

156
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
About

157
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
2015

158
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
2014 events

159
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
I started seeing sort of these

160
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,367
Albie's ex-nsa

161
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Cheap

162
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
DHS

163
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
CIA

164
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,303
Etcetera etcetera and they were all some had no technical background in actual

165
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
Infosec

166
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
And suddenly the pouting

167
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,191
This idea of cyber-security and how this is the neck

168
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,519
You know like the Cyber Pearl Harbor quote by Panetta

169
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
Kicked off this Frenzy

170
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
And then all the sudden you started seeing these

171
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
Internet companies popping out of nowhere

172
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
And then

173
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
You started seeing

174
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
Cyber security of the cyber security industrial complex

175
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,671
Kind of replacing the military industrial complex

176
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:53,951
So much

177
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
2

178
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
The extent that you start seeing

179
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
Actual advertisements for cyber security in the store

180
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
Extremely militaristic terms

181
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
In places like the Beltway

182
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
Or in train stations in DC

183
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,775
Trying to specifically

184
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Advertise

185
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Two. Agent

186
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
CIA

187
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,639
Feed this

188
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,455
It's the second system of government

189
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Going into

190
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,015
Private sector

191
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,879
What is now what a multi multimillion-dollar industry

192
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,231
It's interesting the Beltway ecosystem I would actually say if someone sells

193
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:30,559
Contained unreasonably separate from Silicon Valley it's

194
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:37,215
It's not a dirty secret it's pretty well-known that selling into the government is even worse than selling into big Banks as far as

195
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,007
Insanely long sales cycle

196
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,823
Very unreliable you have to jump through all these hoops

197
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,871
Compliancewise so

198
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,639
Most

199
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,223
Early-stage startups probably aren't going the FED route

200
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
But the Beltway again you do see a lot of former government people solving problems that are very specific to

201
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,231
What they experienced in their prior careers so again it's its own little egos

202
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
Now banks are are the prime

203
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:02,815
Sort of

204
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,655
Target for some of these new startups to these new infosec community

205
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
When you have a sec

206
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Companies

207
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Isolate

208
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,287
It's so big Bank environments are considered

209
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823
Some of the most complex as far as

210
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,615
Security challenges so

211
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
If you get

212
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,527
One of their logos on your you know testimonials section of your website you were considered pretty golden but again the sales Cycles are pretty

213
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:27,135
It's starting to shift I would say that was definitely true 5 years ago but now having one of the

214
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,159
Tech Giants

215
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
Logo on your pages

216
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
About equivalent

217
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,791
How big is this

218
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Industry

219
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,375
Give me a number

220
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,983
It's above 50 Billy I've heard anywhere between 50 billion and 100 billion

221
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Wow

222
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,079
It's it's massive as far as VC funding and mean

223
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
Over 5 billion last

224
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Here alone

225
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
I mean now you're seeing some

226
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Some commercials on

227
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
On major networks

228
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,575
Describing hackers in Cypress

229
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,343
Security

230
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
I mean places where you would have seen a Bud Light ad

231
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
Replacing it

232
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:07,839
Yeah I think I think it's a good thing that there aren't too many consumer-facing information security starves because

233
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
I think

234
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Level of understanding about

235
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Security is

236
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:17,055
Even last on the consumer side the Enterprise side so I can that presents the opportunity for

237
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,383
Pernicious marketing to sell people snake oil

238
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,479
But the consumer Market

239
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,527
That's absolutely true I think

240
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:31,391
There's been a few interesting studies showing that a lot of users expect

241
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:36,767
The organizations and services that used to provide the security and not have to consume it themselves so I think that's the

242
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
The Saving Grace of

243
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,583
Too much fun on the consumer

244
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,679
Is on the other side

245
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
This this business plan

246
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,055
That seems to sort of Taylor to people

247
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,335
Lack of complete

248
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Knowledge

249
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:58,271
On Cyber and they want like a a one-size-fits-all remedy and this goes even two people working in big-time come

250
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,831
Buy something

251
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
Words the cyber

252
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,927
You know you're covered

253
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
Everything that's right Landscaping

254
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,863
The covered that play everybody wants that magic Blinky box that solves all their problems I think fundamentally people don't focus on

255
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Turn off on the fact that

256
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,727
Overall security processes and Enterprises are

257
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
Really broken

258
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,567
Just fundamentally broken the mentalities are often broken again

259
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
Blaming users rather than understanding how to

260
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,895
How to fit security into the

261
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Workflow is and then

262
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:30,527
So banging your head against the wall and they hope that technology will fix everything but it can't

263
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
At a certain point

264
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,623
You can hire as many people as you want and buy as many fancy Gadget

265
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,719
Do you want but if you weren't using the people or the text the right way you're not going to get any

266
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,839
Disclosure

267
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
Existed in this

268
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
Cinespace for a while has been that

269
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
Companies are really embarrassed

270
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
To come out and say that they had problems

271
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
Migas desert

272
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
Government secrecy

273
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,615
And fear kind of

274
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,431
Ratchet up this industry further

275
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,039
It's an interesting problem because my contrarian opinion is that

276
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Breeches

277
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:09,695
Don't really matter that much for Enterprises if we look at even Equifax but Target mostly his

278
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
Entirely recovered from the recent hadn't that's the one where it

279
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,535
Affected

280
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,863
Versailles even perceptively for the most part the stock goes down

281
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,983
Maybe 1% the first day and bounces back up by a week later so most the time of big

282
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
Breach becoming public

283
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,591
Isn't actually any sort of death knell for the company

284
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
Fundamentally this

285
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
The stickiest part of the budget is always compliance

286
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
I would just

287
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,991
The sexy part of the industry so you see

288
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
Very little

289
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Startup attention there

290
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
And frankly

291
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:43,487
Skinny people that want to work on complain stuffing that's part of the reason why they want to focus on all the really sexy technology cuz they want to feel

292
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Oh not just doing a PCI

293
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,119
I'll let you know I'm stopping the Russian Hackers from using O'Day against you know my

294
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,935
No 1000 nodes in the middle of nowhere

295
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,007
Benefits we've been speaking out for about 10 minutes

296
00:11:55,263 --> 00:12:00,383
Finally we hit the Russian hacker

297
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,687
Windsor sing shift is everybody used to

298
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
Want to claim that

299
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
A nation-state attack them to your point

300
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Cuz it's a lot less embarrassing if it's

301
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,087
The government-sponsored Entity hack

302
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
But now and with cyber insurance

303
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,463
Is there a Carvel it's where you can actually get

304
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Payout if

305
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
It was a nation-state because

306
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Is technically

307
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,607
Active warrants so it's not covered

308
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
Insurance so now companies

309
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Really care about Act

310
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,287
Turn the other way where they want to prove Noah wasn't actually nation state has a criminal group so we deserve our insurance

311
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,383
So you're going to RSA soon

312
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Next week right

313
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
It is next

314
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Or this week

315
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Because it's where

316
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
This week at RSA

317
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,319
Yes yes

318
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
Coming at you from the future

319
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,719
Yes I am at RSA already RSA right now

320
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
What do you expect from

321
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,863
Oh man so it's 40,000 people so I don't expect

322
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
Much other than you know crazy crowds lots of marketing gimmicks buzzwords flying ever

323
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
Redirection at you

324
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,383
And very little substance being spoken

325
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,967
I will say that the mean value I personally find from RSA is

326
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
It's everybody goes and so you can meet a bunch

327
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Most people in one place I think

328
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,111
I've been going since

329
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,231
2013 and every year I find less and less utility and checking on you know what's

330
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,351
Newest and latest Technologies I think the last wave that was actually interesting was

331
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
What are all the cast music

332
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
The cloud

333
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
Security Brokers which

334
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,775
If mostly all been acquired other than that scope

335
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
But lately there hasn't been another cat

336
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
Big wave of

337
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,663
Sexy innovation in the space or says mostly

338
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,991
No I've already heard of all of these I know the picture know the buzzwords so

339
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
You sound

340
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:45,855
Like you need to calm down cuz you sound wildly enthusiastic

341
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
Think about

342
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,023
I know I know I think they're very few people I know outside of sales and marketing

343
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
It actually get

344
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
Super hyped about it some of the parties or

345
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,887
Pretty okay but

346
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:04,287
Good luck finding a hotel under you know $500

347
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Defcon

348
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,895
You know what I mean it's like how fun can actually be

349
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
Yeah mean death, at least has

350
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,807
A little more character I feel like our essay is if you had the the most

351
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
Bland cardboard version of our industry

352
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
I hope I really hope some RSA organizers

353
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,071
Heard you say that and run into you now at our side

354
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,911
To see I do have a press pass because I have written about RSA in

355
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,471
Play companies in The Innovation sandbox

356
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,567
Before so

357
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
Cardboard boxes

358
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,967
What are the two forget my exact phrasing but it is emitted cardboard

359
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,551
Cut out version I'm not sure it's that basically just a very

360
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:54,463
Doll if you Stripped Away all the fun and excitement of you know Finding vulnerabilities or working on really awesome techno

361
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
Allergy to actually protect users and you just

362
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
Distilled it into it

363
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Stickiest

364
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
Cena worst substance if you like

365
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
Damn alright

366
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,847
The most customer service I want ya ya I think unless you're really trying to

367
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:17,247
Sell or put yourself out there is a vendor it's not necessarily worth going in there is value if you're security practitioner UK

368
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,807
Can kind of scope out all the vendors in one place

369
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
But

370
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,367
I personally think they need kind of

371
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
You know

372
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Quiet

373
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
Kind of like this room

374
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
Quiet little boots you can rent out so you can

375
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,815
Escape all of the noise and Madness for a little bit and then

376
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
Go back out in the

377
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,935
Start speaking which of boom and infosec

378
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
Companies

379
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
You know our our

380
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,311
Infosec reporters Joseph Cox

381
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
And wenzhou

382
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Belts just get

383
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,431
Inundated with emails all the time

384
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
Advertising music companies

385
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,623
I mean I myself get a bunches while I know what the Huawei is not the same thing but I've been getting hit up by Huawei like it's

386
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,159
Like it's a Bad Axe

387
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
In the last like 4 days

388
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,023
Wow I didn't know a lot of those companies

389
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
Are doing the same thing like money

390
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
We got this

391
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Check out this product

392
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
Ail

393
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,007
Remind check your email

394
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
Don't worry you're great

395
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,639
What is the deal with that does it doesn't work we don't care

396
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:23,039
I don't it must work on someone because why else would they do it I was actually curious now that I have the RCA press pass I've been receiving the

397
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
Does emails I think the most

398
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
Amazing

399
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:31,231
And I use that word in a very specific meeting phrase I saw was Radical math

400
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
There's a company

401
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,583
Radical math

402
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
Math 2 kids in the 90s

403
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,703
And was it's by a doctor smarts a doctor

404
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Smart teacher

405
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Is radical math

406
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
I guess but

407
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:48,383
When you read something like that it's very hard to want to then take the meeting but very

408
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
Phew it was clear that

409
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,759
They're blasting he's out there was nothing kind of personalized about the emails with all just

410
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
Canada the buzzword

411
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
You know it

412
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,975
One of my friends had snake-oil served over word salads in an email form and there's nothing particularly compelling about

413
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,791
The craziest things when you don't get back

414
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,327
Some of these press releases

415
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,911
They like follow-up no cable why didn't you like to talk to us

416
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
You're the worst PR person

417
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
Have you ever spoken to a journalist

418
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
We didn't answer you

419
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,383
I mean

420
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
Only one reason for that

421
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,015
Right exactly yeah it's m it sounds a little bit like nice guy Behavior

422
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,831
Why aren't you noticing me hey pay attention to me I'm entitled to

423
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Your time

424
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,695
Or I just recently read an article and vice and it's really interesting it's about

425
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,559
Women who get who break up with Matt and get these really insane text messages back

426
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
Centerfold things

427
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,167
It's almost like that

428
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
Except I didn't even break up with them

429
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
Yeah there's definitely some

430
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,055
I think there's a

431
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:53,919
A lot of elements of toxic marketing and that's not to say marketing is actually useful marketing works

432
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,199
It gets the

433
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,599
Attention so if someone is legitimately searching for a problem things like a CEO actually work because hopefully they can find the solution to the

434
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,367
Their problem

435
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
The issue is when your

436
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,279
Solution isn't actually solving a problem the only thing you can do to actually sell

437
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Is

438
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,887
Really insane marketing and aggressive sales tactics

439
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Rather than

440
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,471
Speaking hopefully reasonably plainly about the

441
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
Technology obviously everyone dresses

442
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:19,775
Is it up a bit

443
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,055
The certain point

444
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
You know either your product passes

445
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
The tester it doesn't and if it doesn't

446
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
I think

447
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
The

448
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,551
Scary thing is these companies have enough self-awareness that they overcompensate on the sales of work

449
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,879
Okay see you have your crystal ball in front of you

450
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
What do you see this

451
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
This whole industry going

452
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,511
Right now the next to give you a time scale that say 10 years

453
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,559
10 years out

454
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,423
Well by that points will we have to shut down our data centers due to climate change

455
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
Few years when I can say is that

456
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
That's good

457
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,127
Yeah they're they're a bunch of startups out of

458
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,199
Entirely overfunded they received

459
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,759
Yesterday's be sometimes series C rounds

460
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,319
When their sales were still comprised only of their

461
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,343
Personal Network

462
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,647
They haven't really tested in the broader Market

463
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
And so

464
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:14,559
In a generally there will be kind of a mercy round by existing investors they listen this is your last shot to try to make it

465
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
The certain point they're not going to keep

466
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,911
Just throwing money into a hole that they do

467
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
Do that for a surprisingly long

468
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
Sometimes I think over the next two to three years

469
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,799
Some of those will get m&a exits but

470
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,591
Not all of them well

471
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
And Ferb

472
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,943
Are listeners who don't know what an m&a exit is what is it exactly

473
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:36,575
Yes so a recent example would be Cisco acquiring a Duo security so it's when a

474
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,927
Generally larger company acquires a generally smaller company either for cash

475
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Or equity

476
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Critical events

477
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Oakley trade in

478
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,047
And quite often you usually don't get your

479
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
Return value if that's

480
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,423
It it depends odoo a security absolutely did but

481
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Sometimes in critically if you

482
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
Don't see a specific

483
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
Amount

484
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
The purchase price

485
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
What's an ounce

486
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
You know that it's

487
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,687
Sew-in in finance there's this concept of materiality

488
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
So if

489
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,271
But then again with Cisco is a by Duo security I think

490
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,111
2.35 billion that is material to their earnings at

491
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
It's important to their investors

492
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
So they have to stay with the prices

493
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,975
But if it have been for

494
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:21,119
20 million it's disco they don't really have to say with that price was so that's that's kind of a test you can use to

495
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,399
Determine

496
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,775
Particularly if you kind of inside info into the last evaluation by Adventure capitalist whether or not there was a

497
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,127
This is to say you think there's going to be sort of this consolidation

498
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
Assembly smaller companies in the next few years

499
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,247
Some consolidation I think we'll still see

500
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:42,623
In some ways more fragmentation particular as we see like the private-equity giant scooping up

501
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Some of the big players

502
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,487
You either see more consolidation

503
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:51,327
Which I think is is frankly likely or you see that they're trying to

504
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,423
Differentiate themselves more in the markets I think if I had a crystal ball

505
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
That would be really helpful cuz right now I can see it going

506
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,311
A few different ways I definitely the thing I'm certain

507
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:06,687
Of his the fact that many startups will not see successful exits in the question is what

508
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,783
And I think a lot of these as I mentioned the TechCrunch article.

509
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:14,623
75% of all investors in information security startups

510
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
In 2018

511
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,976
Only invested In One Security startup they're not experts in the space

512
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
Dabbling in it but

513
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,584
Cuz it's a hot thing and they saw a headline in the Wall Street Journal

514
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,400
So I think most of those investors go away and the ones

515
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Your experts

516
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,728
And kind of Judge quality a little better and

517
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,544
I think it's similar to what we saw overall in Tech

518
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,872
We saw people like Google coming out right

519
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,688
Because the investors that stayed and really understood text

520
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
Understood what the quality

521
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
Is there a crash

522
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
At all

523
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
In in inside

524
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,232
I think it depends what you mean by a crash I think

525
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
In the next

526
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,096
Buffet next three years it will be harder for

527
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,424
Some security companies to raise more funding I'd I think the

528
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,472
Just huge pile of money that's

529
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,568
Charlie continuously available right now

530
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:11,712
Yeah you can think of it that way that's for sure it certainly feels that way to some csis I think

531
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,296
It's going to be harder to raise money at a certain point I don't think that's even nessus

532
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
Play this year I think it's in

533
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,856
A few years when

534
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:21,952
Investors have to really see hey I'm not getting return When were the VC

535
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,048
Time Horizon is anywhere between five to seven years so there's kind of a lag

536
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Between

537
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
When you

538
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
Noah startups going to feeling when you really feel that it's failed

539
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,448
Ergo the

540
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
You know the song

541
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
The infosec

542
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,800
Bonfire Investments

543
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Will

544
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,128
Probably go out

545
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,992
It's possible if you ask Veterans of the industry's I've been in this industry now about

546
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,552
7 years in one way or another

547
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,856
If you talk to people who've been there since the 90s

548
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392
To them this is really

549
