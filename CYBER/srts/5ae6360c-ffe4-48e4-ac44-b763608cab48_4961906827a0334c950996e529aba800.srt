1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Eagle one package being delivered

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
But the Cavalier private surveillance industry like only called various companies including T-Mobile Sprint

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,192
AT&T selling phone location data with middlemen companies that Hawks on the black market

4
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,592
In one recent story motherboard reporter Joseph Cox has been following wouldn't become a bloody Trail

5
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,712
I'll be back to real time location data I've been Mac who and this

6
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,600
So Joseph

7
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,136
Where does the story begin

8
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,440
What happened exactly walk me through it

9
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,976
So

10
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,024
Anime afternoon

11
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,328
To federal Offices

12
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,120
Walking to a Nissan dealership

13
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,656
In Texas

14
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,984
They tell the manager or the owner that

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
We trying to capture this fugitive Ramon Hutchinson is on the run from Minnesota to Florida

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
Dodge dealership

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,184
There was a family of five in a dealership as well just going around people buying car

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,384
SMG security

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
Rimowa

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
Rob Hutchinson from behind

21
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
Truelancer the fugitives belts onto a table that's a scuffle trying to grab it and then we'll

22
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,448
That are all 2000 Schultz

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,288
Presumably

24
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:26,688
Acrostic settings and Freeman's I pursue after.

25
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,528
This is exactly scream cyber

26
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
So what happened that that was connected to it

27
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
Right yeah it is about

28
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
Montessori initially

29
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,304
But then we found that for lease documents from a company called search at 1

30
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,424
This is one of the fans that provides is rotation taser to bounty hunters

31
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
In that

32
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,800
Thomas the Train vacation dates it was used to track

33
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Once a bounty hunter

34
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
Outside the dealership

35
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
So

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Wheaton

37
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
If phone location data was used

38
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
2 track

39
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Ramon Hutchinson

40
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,280
Triple shooting

41
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,168
That is data showing the phone from Minnesota again while Justin was on the Run song

42
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,728
Was located or pins

43
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
Several times in the Run

44
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,616
We couldn't determine who actually owns that phone

45
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
Because it seemed to you about the Tiffany new number and wasn't

46
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,344
But you can finish records and yeah you to see that someone

47
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,416
Was looking at a wedding bouncy on the square

48
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Pasta

49
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,952
Deschutes

50
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
Today is

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,584
Technology element and potentially a date to Southern elements as well

52
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,144
So what you're saying is there was

53
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
This incident

54
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
That on the surface

55
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Looks like

56
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
A bounty hunter

57
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Arrest of

58
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Fugitive gone

59
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Corley

60
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,336
But there's

61
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
Potential

62
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,384
Towards

63
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
The fact that they were using

64
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Location data

65
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
Attractive person

66
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
Cathay

67
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Inevitably

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Guide for

69
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,880
Yeah I mean we can say for sure

70
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,720
Austin Motors I suppose always framing sizes

71
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,303
There was this tragic event with free people died

72
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
And someone somewhere

73
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,679
Was presumably connected to this Instagram account

74
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:30,079
Locations of the mobile phones 806 wins the shooting off to be some

75
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
Joel

76
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,151
To try to pick up The Fugitive

77
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,247
Someone just happened to look at these phones and see where they would like

78
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
It's

79
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
Indicative of the sort of

80
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,343
Incidence

81
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,415
Sanitation Taissa Canby

82
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,183
Linksters

83
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,023
Edustar shows this I mean this another example of how

84
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
Signals intelligence

85
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
Tracking technology

86
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
Is now being served

87
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Proliferated

88
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Like this

89
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
Yeah I mean

90
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
Senator Ron Wyden

91
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,615
Of course he's being very vocal

92
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
On this subject

93
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,663
He said that

94
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
It's not just me

95
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,991
Privacy it is about

96
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Safety

97
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
As well

98
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
And again I say that they say

99
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,927
You know definitively trance was used to track

100
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
Clearly this is

101
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,791
This is an issue of Public Safety when free people dying

102
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
The family of five

103
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
Against the law

104
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
As well

105
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
It's not just about

106
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,287
How does this this event I mean is very tragic

107
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
Rebuild on the reporting that you

108
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,687
I think it shows more of a

109
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
Human face

110
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
And the consequences

111
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,575
Around the states again

112
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,903
I'm stressing that with note saying that they salads

113
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,303
To the killings of the motives of course I'll be ridiculous these people died because there was a violent

114
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
Shootout

115
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
What it does to char

116
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
The States was being sold in

117
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
The real world

118
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
I mean you look at other dating stories like

119
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,151
Cambridge analytica wishes

120
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
Something about

121
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
Kisame

122
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,319
That doesn't really have a huge tangible impact

123
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
On someone

124
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,183
You now look in a case like this

125
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,071
Seems like either of us as well considering just how why do you use a service was amount bunches

126
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,399
It shows that there is some something wrong

127
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
Immediate

128
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
Concrete

129
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
And visceral

130
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,823
Supposed to

131
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
I mean nothing

132
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
It does for me it's sort of

133
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,455
I think we still even in

134
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
2019 SS

135
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Happy Cinco

136
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
Of the Cyber is very

137
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Sort of

138
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,391
Impenetrable and weird and crazy

139
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
It never really ends up with someone

140
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
Undead

141
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,767
And this is the case of it actually showing that

142
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,095
Not only are these Technologies widely available but

143
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Either being used and

144
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,167
They can meet about things

145
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:09,055
Yeah I mean I think it touches a bit on the same tribout's toolkit which is this

146
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
When you physically have access

147
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
When you put it on there

148
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
Application guess who was our messages

149
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,575
It's ever been used in pieces

150
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
Relationship status show

151
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
A concrete

152
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
If somebody using

153
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
A piece of technology

154
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,327
A few years ago with it being relatively

155
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Obscure

156
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
Disassemble sofa

157
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,655
Sing

158
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,495
Where's the location that has been sold by the carriers

159
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,799
AT&T T-Mobile and Sprint

160
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Trickle down to

161
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Use cases

162
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
When you look at the dates

163
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
How many

164
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
Particular charm is used to locate

165
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,087
The same account is located the bounce

166
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,135
His phone off of the shooting

167
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:02,303
Over the course of the number of years it was also used to rotate some 4,500

168
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
It was used Batman

169
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,167
Thousands and thousands of times

170
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,447
And that leads

171
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:10,239
Maisel supervisor

172
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
To believe that this person was selling

173
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,359
That phone location Des rocs s

174
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
On the black market

175
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:19,199
Cuz normally people need to paint.

176
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,247
500 phone number

177
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
Even if you were counting on

178
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
And according to the terms and conditions of this

179
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,999
You're only supposed to use two IP addresses you know this is to minimize abuse

180
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,607
Maybe you can write from your mobile phone or you know from to workstations or something like that

181
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,751
Connecting 24 Rainier from Israel School across the United States

182
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,543
So it does look like

183
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
Not only is it

184
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
Unprofessional people apparently connect

185
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Estate sale

186
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:53,759
He looks like Elvis are we selling it as well

187
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
Of course

188
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
It does make you wonder how

189
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,951
If these kind of like

190
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
Smaller

191
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535

00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
It makes you wonder what

195
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
The NSA would have

196
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Or what some of these

197
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
Larger more well-financed

198
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Intelligence age

199
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Have at their disposal

200
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
I mean we saw that recent

201
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
McCoy

202
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
From a cybersecurity company that suspected Chinese records of broken into a numbers

203
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,319
Telcos to get location information

204
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
Cool records not so strange

205
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
That is clearly

206
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
Unintelligent

207
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
Sleds

208
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Operation

209
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Retaining names Nation

210
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
What made me

211
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
Look at it twice was that

212
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
Well if you're in the US you can just buy them

213
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,823
Hacking you

214
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
Chinese hackers retard sing of the UK or maybe European tocco's as well when you probably

215
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
You can just buy some locations

216
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
Well that's a very

217
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Very happy thought

218
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:07,999
Think that that certi

219
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
Very private data is

220
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,655
Of course after reporting

221
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,751
Patelco recess Mouse stops. And I believe they

222
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
.

223
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
By the beginning of

224
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
So is no longer on going

225
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Abilities

226
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Still

227
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,735
As far as I know the black market trays

228
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:31,807
Even if people can't get hold of this States

229
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,903
The telcodata

230
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Supply chain

231
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
Carrabba's

232
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,743
2

233
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
There must be

234
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
I mean especially when

235
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
You know that this location

236
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,655
Data can also be very profitable

237
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
Right

238
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,007
Yeah I mean

239
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Isaiah

240
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,175
If you millions of it as a new Boston tens of Millions

241
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
Millions

242
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
To say it was a lot more

243
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
Older people elsewhere or not

244
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
Supply chain

245
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
She might issue off of 50 Grand

246
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
To pull someone in

247
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,375
You spend

248
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,959
A few hundred dollars maybe she's thousand dollars on the black market

249
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
Exception to process

250
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:32,991
If you didn't sell anything on the black market you can do a mock-up alternator 200-300 400%

251
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
Is the people in the Boston

252
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Supply chain

253
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
Probably has

254
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,647
Imusa games

255
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
What store carries

256
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,631
Abusive, when looking all the states

257
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
And you suspect that there's more stories like the

258
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
Newberry trash

259
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Timeout

260
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,359
Yeah absolutely I mean even from

261
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,663
When T-Mobile responded

262
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,015
Two-letter

263
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
Call the company

264
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Theta

265
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,927
I imagine that the are going to be more stories

266
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Like this

267
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Round of 16

268
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:18,303
I'm we're looking for leads us to come up as well

269
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,983
That is sort of the issue with the story I feel like even though we've done several different hospitals on the

270
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
Based on

271
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:35,711
Illegal documents and data from inside the company that resources shoes

272
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:41,087
I really feel like his cliches is the way only seeing the tip of the iceberg

273
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,695
Thousands tens of thousands of sirens Benji located this way

274
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,231
The has to be more

275
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
Abusada

276
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:52,351
Absolutely well this story definitely struck me and I

277
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
I really wanted to the Showcase it

278
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
