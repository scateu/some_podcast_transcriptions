And robbers and how it all relates to the repair industry

37
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,392
I want to start here by talking about

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
How the iPhone has changed

39
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976

Afifa gum drop someone off the rifle

44
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240

45
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,568

00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
Then the victim removes iCloud

From the

00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
People Tennessee complaints

51
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:38,464
Behind I mean this

52
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
Security mechanism

53
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,096
Is actually having

54
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Dim sum

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,936
Tangible physical consequences on how feves

56
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
Actually trying

57
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,824
Right so I think most people would agree that

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
This is a pretty good

59
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,688
Technological security measure in aggregate

Yunnan

61
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,784
You want to make sure that iPhones are not worth

62
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,344
$1,000 if they're getting stolen

63
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
But like you said

64
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,440
You know these are still taking them

65
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,840
So just to be clear I mean this has changed the behavior criminals but if you go back even further I mean 10 years ago

66
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,144
If you had an iPhone and someone took it

67
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
Naked Juice

68
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,240
Sell it on the black market no problem and move on with their lives

69
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
Security measures that were talking about

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Right

73
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
So yeah apple introduced

74
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,432
Something cool

75
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
Which is not

76
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,784
The PIN code to use for access your phone

77
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
It is the surface features is

78
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Tonight would win

79
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,928
Email login to iCloud and say hey my

80
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976

86
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
I'm without you

87
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
ICloud

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,336
Password and email address

89
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Essentially

90
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128
Expensive

91
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
Any fees they need that

92
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,248
To be able to actually

93
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
Remove stains from ants

94
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
Wipe the phones then someone else

95
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,112
Can you use a

96
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
Securely

97
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
I technically

98
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,280
Security measure and it has impacted how

99
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,071
Eaves to operate

100
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
Install

101
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Necessarily

102
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,959
Even though

103
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
Criminal just going to change

104
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Bedtime

105
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
Sing with this Market

106
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Embarrassed

107
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Epsom

108
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
Increase by

109
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Activation lock

110
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,135
Right and I think the specifics here are important to

111
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
Explain just because there is a lot

112
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,463
To the speakers

113
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Various different types of locks

114
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
Like you said it's not the PIN code

115
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,631
I it is the iCloud password which is

116
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:58,495
Basically your Apple account ID the one that you use to log into the App Store

117
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
Or iTunes for instance

118
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
And what happens why is it such a big deal is

119
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,711
If you reset the phone and sell it

120
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
And iCloud lock is still on there

121
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:11,807
You can't

122
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
Associated with a different Apple ID

123
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,951
So you need the person's original password in order to

124
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,303
Need to turn the phone on do anything with it you also need it to download apps

125
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
Azure use iTunes

126
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
And

127
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
This is very important when your resetting your phone or if your

128
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
Stealing a phone because

129
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
You need to be able to disassociated with

130
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
The original owners account

131
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,127
Andre associated with the new owners

132
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Yeah I mean when you doing

133
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Accentuate

134
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,735
You stole them

135
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
Actually

136
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
This phone is linked to North Harbor Town

137
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
What's the process

138
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
Even though

139
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,655
Define believe that

140
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Access headless

141
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,103
Right so a criminal will steal a phone and then if they don't

142
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,967
You know hold up someone at gunpoint and ask them to remove iCloud lock

143
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
They are then stuck with a phone that is a brick

144
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Bye

145
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,647
It's still obviously a inexpensive piece of electronics

146
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
And criminals have figured

147
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:27,071
Hey I'll just steal this phone and hopefully I'll be able to figure out a way to remove iCloud

148
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,887
And then they have you know a very valuable device

149
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
So what do they do

150
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,239
Like because criminals have found ways around this

151
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,543
Right yeah so

152
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,615
Even when the criminal has the phone

153
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,919
They main offices.

154
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,759
The target to remove iCloud themselves I still want to get up

155
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,319
To do this next

156
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,135
Play some souls or they can they provide the siren

157
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
To someone else

158
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
You could probably do on their behalf

159
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
But the next stage is that going to try to fish

160
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
The iCloud

161
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,863
Impossible

162
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935

00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
Gmail password

164
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,591
What's the credentials or anything like that

165
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
It's essentially the same

166
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Process

167
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,735

On the planet I mean they're not bypassing two-factor Authentication

185
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
But they do appear to be

186
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Which is

187
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231

188
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023

If it was unnecessary

194
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
I've known about this problem for a

195
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,711
Q years because I come across

196
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:25,343
A group of people who want to unlock iCloud locked devices all the time which I'll talk about in a second

197
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
But I'm curious

198
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,743
How did you come across this how long have you been monitoring these groups and where did you find them

199
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,303
I think somebody started working

200
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,327
Gemelli

201
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
Find out how

202
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:44,031
Fishing kits

203
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,591
Is it more research on identifying

204
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
Particular groups that use

205
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
These fishing kits

206
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
Avenged I just managed to

207
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
Infiltrate a sweet tooth

208
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135

210
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
Wishes you know

211
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Just say

212
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,767
The group Chats on the messaging app and this is why

213
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,815
A lot of the actors were exchanging

214
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Tips

215
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
I'm asking people for advice

216
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,447
Uploading photos is that successful unlock

217
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,495
A

218
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,567
Nexus stolen phone when where am I going to

219
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
Jets

220
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,383
The password and how can I get about that

221
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,455
Basically like it's clearing house

222
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
When you are my son gets

223
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
Stolen

224
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,343
I miss a good chance it could end up in one of these traps

225
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
20 more as well

226
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
This is why

227
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
I was in there for

228
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:39,839
I think

229
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Intitle before I go

230
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
Rostra

231
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,311
Congratulated us for sitting in his chat room so long

232
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,615
Yeah it

233
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,711
East it was just sitting there and trying to absorb what they were

234
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,271
What they were doing because of course

235
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,575
I-17 ology wilderun lingo

236
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Weekly

237
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
How to reverse engineer

238
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,511
Figure out how they were actually getting information on phones and how they would actually look

239
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:13,887
Right so so far this is a pretty interesting story and that it's got this melding of

240
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,983
Physical crime and cybercrime But ultimately the hacking involved is not

241
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
Terribly interesting it's you know as you said

242
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
Custom fishing kits

243
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,663
Sally seen it a million times before with a bunch of other types of hacks

244
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,319
So there are a lot of interesting wrinkle to this one of which is when you try to reset an iPhone it will say

245
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,135
Please enter iCloud password and then I will have

246
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:41,535
An email address but it will only show the first letter and the last letter of the email address and then in between it will have a bunch of

247
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Asterisk

248
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
So presumably these

249
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
BDubs Fishers don't really know

250
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:53,567
Any of the information about the phone that they're trying to look up or the or the person's account so how did I get this

251
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
Yeah it seems like a hog problem but there are a lot of

252
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,735
Stop thief could find out

253
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Information

254
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,391
I mean Festival when is a stolen phone

255
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,511
It will say on it hey please call me on this number cuz this phone is stolen oversleeping

256
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
With these fishing kits

257
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Incendies

258
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
Convincing the victim

259
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:28,639
Please go ahead and log in with your iCloud email address and password

260
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Email address

261
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
Potential

262
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:36,575
Of course you could also do social media stalking and some other research as well to find it but it's

263
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Messages

264
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
Seem to be one

265
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,391
The main ways

266
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,487
To find out who these people actually have to talk it when they got hold of her stolen time

267
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,839
Right but we also found these look up tools online that have

268
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,399
You know at least some information about

269
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
The phones

270
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Neo specs

271
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
And when it was

272
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,055
Just purchased and stuff like that which comes in handy

273
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,127
When you're trying to do this other method of

274
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,455
Unlocking an iCloud locked iPhone

275
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,295
So that that's another reason why I found the story to be very interesting is that

276
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,855
There are other ways to unlock

277
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
A phone

278
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,951
It's just you need to get apple to do it for you

279
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
And that is a lot more come

280
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Implicated

281
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,375
Psoas

282
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
IMEI number

283
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,983
Which is a unique code given to every single phone

284
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Attack on Titan

285
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,543
Into a website

286
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,591
Return with information such as

287
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,663
Hey this is just on the carrier

288
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
Campbell's condensed

289
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
Fill out a

290
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,063
Receipt

291
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
Invoice

292
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:51,071
Photoshop templates that are online and allow you to enter

293
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,863
Whatever you want and make it look like

294
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:53,631
Stereo receiver

295
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
Yeah yeah yeah

296
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,447
Acrylic paint by number

297
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
Hey is

298
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Is a

299
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
It's a ready-made template the look

300
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Looks really legit

301
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
You just have to

302
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,639
Listen to the information you found about the phone

303
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
Take it in

304
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
And it should match

305
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
Hopefully be enough.

306
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,575
Convince someone

307
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,439
Specifically we found genius manager

308
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
Would be after that remove

309
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Be like that

310
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
What is 2 using these tools

311
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Which are being utilized

312
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,335
Right so it's this social engineering that's happening at physical Apple

313
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Stores

314
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
And

315
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:41,759
Presumably this happens we know that Apple Managers can request an unlock

316
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,063
And we also know that Apple can

317
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:47,647
I do it remotely because you had some emails from Apple

318
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
From that

319
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Hacking group.

320
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
Don't mention that

321
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,255
They can do remotely

322
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Yes I do

323
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,887
Yeah she said you may need to go into an Apple Store into it physically

324
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
Recipe for Machop

325
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,263
Gmail

326
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
And say hey

327
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
I'm stuck

328
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
Looked at my phone here

329
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Invoice

330
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,295
Unlocked like that which

331
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,879
Seems like probably an easy way to do it Robin having

332
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
Courage Julio.

333
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
Cigar International store

334
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,743
And do it in person

335
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
You can just do it for email

336
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,351
Screenshots of emails

337
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,375
People posting

338
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
The Shining

339
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:36,031
Right so in my reporting I heard over and over again that this does happen that

340
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
People go to the Apple Store

341
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:42,943
We have internal documents from Havel that show that a manager can request an unlock

342
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,015
But I also heard from multiple people that

343
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,319
If you get caught it's very bad like

344
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
Beetle

345
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,391
You can probably convince a lot of

346
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,743
Managers are geniuses to do this for you if you pretend to be

347
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
You know someone who

348
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Happened to forget their password

349
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,727
But if they see you coming to store over and over again and you get the same manager they're going to know something is up and you're going to be blackballed in some

350
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,055
Amway

351
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,871
Whitby I mean I suppose it's

352
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,991
East Summit approves you with an University selling subwoofer

353
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Used.

354
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
Persecution around it

355
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Do not move

356
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,951
Something else

357
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
I like crying

358
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
Even though as well speak about

359
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,863
This industry does intersect with no legitimate

360
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
Wright's repair

361
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,471
IPhone signs

362
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
Deciduous topre Donnelly

363
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,871
Yeah it is I talked to someone who study this quite a lot

364
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:50,271
And he told me you know not every iCloud lock iPhone is illegally obtained but

365
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,599
Every method for unlocking it is currently illegal

366
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,183
And I think it's now a good time to talk about

367
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,023
Who is actually trying to unlock iPhones Beyond thieves

368
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Just because it's at

369
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
It's pretty interesting

370
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,655
So I came across this story or at least

371
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
Piqued my interest about a year ago

372
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
I'm in a lot of right to repair face

373
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,311
Facebook groups and

374
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:17,663
The right to repair is Basu this political movement of Independence

375
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
Irepair folks

376
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,295
Sort of like the corner store that will replace your iPhone screen

377
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,575
Or the

378
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,951
Random person who will fix a John Deere tractor but is not authorized by John Deere to fit

379
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:30,719
Fix a tractor

380
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Who is

381
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Fighting at the moment

382
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
4

383
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
Better access to

384
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Parts

385
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,887
Tools diagnostic information

386
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Etcetera

387
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Because

388
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,727
All across the electronics world

389
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:46,847
Take manufacturers like apple and Microsoft John Deere IBM Etc

390
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
AR

391
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
Trying to lock down

392
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,527
The ability for end-users as well as independent repair people to fix

393
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,319
The things that they normally own

394
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
And apple is

395
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,159
Notoriously bad at this

396
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,463
They have been sore blobbing against

397
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,255
Legislation at every turn

398
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
I in Norway.

399
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
Sued a guy who

400
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
I bought aftermarket

401
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,191
Get parts from China and Apalachee lost that case

402
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
In the United States they worked with AIDS

403
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Department of Homeland Security

404
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
Security to

405
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:21,407
Prevent aftermarket and third-party parts from reaching independent repair people

406
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
And so

407
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:28,319
There's basically this apple versus the independent repair World mindset going on and

408
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,111
This is where

409
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
Locked iPhones come in

410
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Because

411
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,279
Not every single iCloud locked iPhone is stolen

412
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
When

413
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,471
Someone breaks their phone or when someone doesn't upgrade for their phone from T-Mobile

414
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Or Verizon

415
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
Sprint

416
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
They will take it back

417
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
Tula carrier

418
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
And someone at the

419
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
The carrier is supposed

420
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
To say

421
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,431
Hey can you please remove your iCloud

422
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
From that so that we can refurbish it and resell it

423
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
That happens most of the time

424
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
But not always

425
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
Often these phones

426
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:10,303
Person the customer service person forgets to remove the iCloud or ask their customer to remove the iCloud

427
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,887
And then it becomes a brick and suddenly Verizon has

428
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
As a brick a phone

429
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,007
So what they do is they sell these phones in bulk at

430
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Carrier auctions

431
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
What are called

432
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,383
And people in the iPhone repair industry by them

433
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
They buy them in bulk

434
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
I've talked to

435
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
About a dozen

436
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,039
You know people who own iPhone repair shops

437
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
What's this point they say

438
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
That they came across you know

439
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
ICloud locked

440
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
IPhone

441
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
All the time

442
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,951
So

443
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,023
There are all these out there on the market but there's nothing

444
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:41,791
To happen

445
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
There's nothing happening with them

446
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,935
So there's some people in this world who are stripping them for parts

447
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
They're able to take like

448
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
Take the back camera or

449
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,359
The volume buttons are they charging port and put it onto a consumer's

450
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,175
You know otherwise unrepairable phone

451
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,759
And this is how they get their parts because Apple won't sell them

452
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
And so

453
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,111
There's naturally a lot of these people who

454
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Have you

455
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,695
Dozens or hundreds of iCloud locked iPhones

456
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
And they think

457
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,767
Rather than stripping is for parts

458
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
Why don't I figure out how

459
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
How to unlock

460
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
Yeah let me know

461
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
Is sort of like an uncomfortable

462
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Alliance

463
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,007
Is between the small legitimate side and then is cool

464
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,567
The highly legal really really shady

465
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
I can

466
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
Supply chain like these two

467
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,503
These two sorts of Industries would never really meet

468
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
If it wasn't for

469
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
Decision

470
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
What do people kids

471
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Skip Hop

472
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
Right yeah I spoke to you know dozens of people and

473
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,887
A lot of them are like

474
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,471
I won't buy iCloud locked devices from people who walk into my

475
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,263
I store because there's a good chance that it's

476
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Stolen

477
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:02,431
But if I'm buying it at a carrier auction I know that it came from T-Mobile or Sprint or what have you asked

478
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,479
Sheri on some of these insurance companies

479
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
And

480
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,855
They didn't have a phone they legally own but that they are unable to unlock

481
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,415
And so if they buy a phone for yunnan

482
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Two hundred bucks

483
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
They can part it out

484
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
4

485
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,511
You know

486
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
Sell the various parts in make

487
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:23,423
Got a couple hundred dollars or they can get iCloud removed and resell that phone as refurbished

488
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
Stan Getz

489
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,239
Six seven eight hundred dollars

490
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,127
So for them it's a lot less work and it's a lot more lucrative if they're able to remove iCloud

491
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:38,783
So there are people I mean I talked to a lot of people in the industry most of them said that they don't deal with iCloud

492
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Unlocking

493
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
But there are people who both

494
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:47,999
Do this in person scamming where they will go to the Apple Store and ask for an iCloud unlock and then there's also

495
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,303
Also people who use the services that just

496
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Was talking about earlier

497
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Yes I do

498
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
She say when

499
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,239
You have this very very strange crossover between the people who need to

500
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:03,103
Unlock the iCloud phone just because

501
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
And then you have people who

502
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,431
Holding

503
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
Marriage

504
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
Between these two

505
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,280
It is and most people seem to be very uncomfortable with this the Facebook group I was mentioning where I first learn

506
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Learned about this

507
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,840
You know they have posts

508
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:27,168
From people asking like hey do you do iCloud unlock

509
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,216
Do you know how to do iCloud unlock

510
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,776
Every single week I've been in that group for

511
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
Years at this point in time

512
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,592
I seen it over and over again

513
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,640
It's gotten to the point where

514
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:40,224
The more legitimate side the people who are like I don't want to touch this

515
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Is that all

516
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,296
Say we shouldn't have this in our group at all

517
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
We need to ban this

518
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
This sort of

519
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,416
Behavior we need to ban people asking for this

520
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
Just because

521
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
It's going to make us look

522
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
Illegitimate

523
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:58,144
And there's one guy who's very prominently involved in the right to repair movement his name is Michael oberdick

524
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
She is

525
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,960
The owner of I Outlet which is

526
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,776
Store in Ohio or a series of stores

527
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
And he sort of went

528
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
To YouTube

529
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
And posted this

530
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,920
I guess you would call her rants

531
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
Basically saying that

532
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
People in the industry need to

533
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Clean up

534
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,344
Because they're never going to get legislation passed

535
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
If there is the

536
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
Is perception

537
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
That they are

538
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
Working with hackers and

539
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
Shadyside

540
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:23,744
Industry

541
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
How am I supposed

542
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,608
Set a border in the boardroom in a room with a senator of a state

543
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,912
Fight for the right to repair

544
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
And say

545
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,496
Yes we reserve the right to the parts of digoxin

546
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Tools

547
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,616
All the things that we need from these manufacturers when we've got people

548
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,944
Is a business model

549
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,016
I'm sorry but you're the reason why

550
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
We can't get ship pass

551
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,344
You're the reason why

552
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,648
We can't get contracts that we need

553
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,232
You are the reason the industry is looked at as a

554
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
Ugly stepchild

555
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
Knock it off

556
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,376
And I really think that Michael is right here because I've covered this

557
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,960
Political movement for quite some time and apples arguments

558
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Gangsta

559
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,056
Are that you know these people are breaking our terms of service fees

560
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
These people

561
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,968
Cannot be trusted if we sort of give them better access to our tools they will take advantage of them and

562
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,760
Will you

563
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,112
Become conduits for hackers and thieves and and stuff like that so

564
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:26,720
I think that the movement really does need to weed out people who are working

565
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,280
With hackers to remove iCloud

566
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,096
But they are in a really tough situation because

567
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:34,144
They can't get parts any other way

568
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,496
They've often acquired these phones legally and they have no options from

569
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
Apple Jacks

570
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Remove them

571
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
So I talked

572
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,872
To a couple people and they suggested

573
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,176
You know maybe activation lock should only go

574
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
Phone has been reported as

575
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,016
Is lost or stolen

576
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,576
I don't know if that work from apples and

577
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Apple didn't really want to talk to us for

578
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,136
The story

579
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,976
But it is the sort of like weird underbelly the industry

580
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
And

581
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:04,096
And a weird melding of both cybercrime and real life

582
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
Crime as well as the Grand Marquis

583
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
Right

584
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
How to repair

585
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,984
So we publish this story last week and

586
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
I think the response was

587
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,824
Sort of instantaneous wasn't it just

588
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,688
Yeah I mean usually also we publish

589
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:24,320
A piece that people interested in a few emails about oh that's cool

590
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,648
Quite a few different people reaching out

591
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
Simply saying

592
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
Hey can you help me

593
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
Remove iCloud from iPhone

594
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,536
You shut down

595
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,120
At least this time I would let you like did you even read the peace

596
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,400
But it literally

597
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
How it goes down

598
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
Clearly

599
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,080
Ya love interest

600
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
People try to find out how to unlock

601
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:53,504
Yeah and there's one method that we didn't really mention or go into detail on and it's really crazy and I don't know all this

602
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,552
Specific so maybe it's something for another

603
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Marquis

604
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
But

605
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,672
There are refurbishing factories in China

606
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
That will basically

607
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,744
Take off a little chip

608
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,328
On the motherboard so they use a microscope and

609
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
Tweezers and takeoff

610
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,400
The CPU

611
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:14,752
And then they are reflashing the CPU on a chip reprogrammer

612
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:21,152
And putting that ship back on the board which requires desoldering and all this stuff is it's very Time and Labor until

613
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,200
And save and afterwards

614
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:27,040
They basically have a device that is iCloud unlocked because they are

615
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
Essentially creating a new device

616
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
Buy flashing

617
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
A new IMEI

618
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
Hi number to it

619
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,304
And that's just the whole nother level that we didn't really get into but I heard of

620
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,072
A few times

621
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,888
And folks in the repair world are like

622
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
I just

623
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
I can't even fathom

624
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,776
Having enough time to do that but it is happening and

625
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,616
There's YouTube video of it it's very wild we'll put it in the show notes

626
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,200
The wild world of iCloud

627
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,248
IPhone unlocking

628
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:02,368
We will have another follow-up to Ed sometime if we can ever figure out that China

629
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Story

630
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:07,232
Just if I want to do a quick update to a story that was on this podcast

631
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
A few weeks ago

632
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,328
We basically spent

633
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:16,960
$300 to find location data from a phone that we asked to be tracked by a bounty hunter

634
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,056
In the meantime you've done an entirely new investigation

635
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,128
That is a very similar but different thing

636
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
Regarding location data and bouncy

637
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
So can you give us a quick update

638
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,344
Yeah and the original piece it was one cup

639
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,368
CNN we

640
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Where is England

641
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,672
Instances buying

642
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
On the Block

643
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Case

644
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,888
Are we going to 10:00

645
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,472
Shine another company was selling to around 250

646
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,264
Hunter's bail agent

647
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Things to Independence

648
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,896
It confirms that some of those also selling the black

649
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Scale

650
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
And the new investigation

651
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
Cell tower

652
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,928
Mattel toys of Elsa being selling

653
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,952
GPS

654
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,488
Which is highly precise

655
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,536
I'm usually only reserved

656
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:18,656
Investigation is on motherboard. Vice.com

657
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:23,008
I don't think we'll do another episode about it but definitely worth your read

658
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,896
I just have thanks as always for joining us and we'll throw it back to bed

659
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,736
This week's episode was produced by Jason kabler

660
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
Recorded by Gene White

661
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
