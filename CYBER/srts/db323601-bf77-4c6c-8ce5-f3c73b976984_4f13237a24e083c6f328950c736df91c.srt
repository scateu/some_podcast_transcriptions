They're going to say you know I 5/8 in our enemies in 2013

00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
Edward Snowden hillford thousands of top-secret documents from the NSA and its spy partners then fled to honk

Kong-rey gave them to chew journalist

Was the nsa's worst nightmare

12
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,616
But from those weeks and countless lives we citizens of the world

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,584
My mom calls me Benny but I think we should probably just

Expect UD

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,344
No I mean it it's funny because you know

37
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,672
I just sort of growing up in the intelligence

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
Russia is justice

39
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,024
Terrifying

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,328
Place you know it's it's it's Mordor

41
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,192
I'm and I hadn't worked Russia's at Target I had worked East Asia

42
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472

Buffets

44
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,312
You know I had a little bit of familiarity

45
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,104
I would like Japanese

46
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,896
Mandarin Chinese

47
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,688
But I've never used Russians

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,296
Understand anything about it and you know I never planned to be in Russia

49
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
I've been when I was leaving Hong Kong

50
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,928
En route to Ecuador ironically enough

51
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Captain Russia

52
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,400
And the funny thing is you know

53
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
I had always worked

54
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
Overseas whenever I get the chance

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,312
I was stationed in Switzerland

56
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
You're up and then I

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
Stationed outside Tokyo with an Air Force Base

58
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
Imentor

59
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,088
Living overseas wasn't surprised me it wasn't unusual but

60
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,928
Russia was definitely definitely the biggest and most unexpected

61
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
Gabrielle paderewski

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,216
I've been in the hospital

63
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,264
Because all my work in my contacts

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
English

65
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
It's not as good as it should

66
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
So I mean

67
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
One question people ask me when I said I was interview

68
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,832
They want to know what are you do today I mean I'm assuming you're not cooking spaghetti with your girlfriend all day anymore

69
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,904
Looking for my all day

70
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,256
We live together I'm and it's it's it's actually really nice

71
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
You know I expected

72
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
Life was going to be a lot harder

73
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,959
You know I expected end up in Guantanamo

74
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,799
And so life has actually become quite normal

75
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
Majority of my life

76
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,895
I is my work at the freedom the press found a

77
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
I'm where I'm done

78
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
The president of the

79
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Are there

80
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
And we work on technology

81
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,599
Basically to make the

82
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Justice

83
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Effective

84
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
Day-to-day work of Journalism

85
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:53,119
A little bit easier a little bit safer a little bit more secure because it's becoming so much more difficult

86
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:53,887
Journalist

87
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,679
Are being treated

88
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
Increasingly as legitimate Target

89
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
It's right for all these different foreign intelligence agencies

90
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
For all of these authoritarian regimes

91
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
I increasingly

92
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,967
That we've seen even just for Corporation

93
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,551
If you look at the even academic researchers

94
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,367
Such as in the case of

95
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,511
Are you have these groups like Black Cube that are being hired by you know who knows like he was a private intelligence

96
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,327
And they're going after

97
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,351
Akademiks

98
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Journalist

99
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:30,239
I even people at think tanks and general policy circles

100
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,847
I'm in Tinder trying to get them to say something

101
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
It would be incriminating

102
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,967
I so they can discredit their reporting or their research

103
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:45,087
I'm in insulting the question comes in what do we do about this what can we do

104
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
About this

105
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,391
And how do we avoid

106
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,719
I'm unfortunately the the direction that we're headed in

107
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Which is

108
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
An arms race

109
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,375
Between Ordinary People and ordinary journalists and Order academics

110
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,447
And he's very well-read

111
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Operations

112
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Governments

113
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
Because we're going to lose

114
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:09,151
Right but if it's a fight that we haven't asked for us to bite that we have

115
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
There's no choice between gauging that we're going to have to do our best

116
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
That takes a lot of time

117
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,415
So when you were inside the intelligence community did you ever see

118
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,975
What's say something like the NSA targeting journalists

119
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:29,631
Yeah actually this was publicly reported in some of the stories that came out post 2013

120
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
I'm particularly journalist

121
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,007
Saw in the Middle East were like Al Jazeera

122
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,151
Right because this is one of the dangers it is when a government starts to feel like they can decide

123
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,711
Who is is not journalist

124
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Too short

125
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,831
And deserves the journalistic protection right

126
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,415
I'm in ultimately that that comes down to meaning

127
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,719
You know are you American

128
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
Or do you work for one of the

129
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Largest

130
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,095
Signs for the most privileged

131
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Best Western

132
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:07,775
If that's not the case right they'll find an excuse to the Fine adjust Geisha that they simply won't even ask her consider it

133
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,103
I know go look this person's work

134
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
To us from our perspective as spies

135
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
Has what we call

136
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,479
Foreign intelligence

137
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,503
Value

138
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
Neither report

139
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
So go ahead

140
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
You know

141
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,439
I'm always being active journalist and and motherboard is a lot of

142
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,767
A lot of work that I know governments would be interested in

143
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
Me my respect is always

144
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:36,191
All I can do is slow them down because if they really want it they're going to get it so I have to be able to just sort of

145
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
Sandboxes much

146
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Impossible

147
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
An order

148
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287
2

149
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Yeah

150
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
Maybe by the time I get to it it doesn't matter anymore

151
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Well

152
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
It's a yes or no

153
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,759
I mean that that's partially true but the idea that you can't do any

154
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,831
The idea that you can't keep yourself from being hacked

155
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
I'm he's actually not true

156
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
I'm the question is

157
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,303
Who can you stop from behind how long can you stop them from hacking you

158
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,655
At what level of resourcing and budget and Manpower

159
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
Are they going to have to allocate again

160
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
You

161
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
Is an individual Target with all of your different precautions

162
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,311
To get what they react

163
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,919
If you use a stock iPhone and use stock apps and everything like that

164
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,991
I they can get you my pretty easily nowadays

165
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
Unfortunately every swerve iPhone

166
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,623
Is is running an apple iMessage underneath it

167
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,695
I'm at and that's why we're finding tremendously long

168
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
And that's not the case that we thought in the past

169
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,583
Is the encryption that uses is quite good

170
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:40,191
But what happens if this means basically the Apple ecosystem

171
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,215
Islamic

172
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
Which means every

173
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,591
IPhone I has you're not the same operating

174
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,711
Because people are actually catching which is a good thing we want people to be up to

175
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,479
Today topless

176
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,575
But it also has a stained stock Suite of apps

177
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:02,975
I just got the same sort of firmwares got all of these hidden programs that are running on every phone that you don't interact with

178
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
My databases

179
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,863
And this is true whether using Android or Apple's IOS

180
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:13,727
But the problem is with Android it is with blessing a curse

181
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Androids

182
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
Catching

183
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Sort of

184
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Landscape

185
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
Is an absolute disaster

186
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,223
Because all these manufacturers

187
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,599
They pray these phones they sell these phones and then two or three years later they've banned

188
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
The people who actually

189
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,975
Provide the

190
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
Software right

191
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,119
Is running on the very low level of your phone

192
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,191
These are the things that are controlling like the

193
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
The radios

194
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,751
Connect to cell phone towers or

195
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,079
Wi-Fi hotspots right there on all the time

196
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,663
I'm the basic features of the phone

197
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
These can't

198
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
B

199
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Updated

200
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
Stop by the actual

201
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,319
Own Bender

202
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,975
They have to be updated by the chipset vendor people like Qualcomm rights and nobody's the average people have

203
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:07,999
Herd of Qualcomm

204
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,583
But they make the chips right like Intel makes them for laps

205
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,935
Anywhere describing to is is like

206
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Target

207
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,007
As welfare agencies

208
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,823
All these bands all these things are exploitable

209
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
Target surface

210
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
Stats on these phones

211
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
And for Android

212
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:32,575
It's not being patched which is a disaster for older phones because everybody's vulnerable

213
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:38,463
But at the same time because it's not a monoculture every phone is broken and slightly different way

214
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Pinstripe

215
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,839
Isis actually quite difficult for these exploit vendors to have a universal X

216
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
The works against any Android phone

217
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,263
Women are from different

218
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
I so it's hard to get for the skeleton

219
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,175
Where is what we found is Apple's taking security quite seriously

220
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,759
I'm an event much better about privacy for example in Google

221
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:05,855
Because every phone is running the same software

222
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,415
Increasing watch juicier Target

223
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,767
For these now private companies that are operating out of places like Israel in French

224
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
And

225
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,631
They hire all of these guys called exploit Veil

226
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,727
Calipers right which are basically just reverse engineers

227
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,031
We use there their powers for evil

228
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,591
To look at the phone

229
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
And just attack

230
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,943
And see if they can find something

231
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
The breaks

232
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,111
In a predictable way and I'm usually when they do something basic something fundamental that every phone

233
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,903
Has to do in order to function

234
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
Like

235
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,463
Accept SMS message

236
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
And this is what I message does an iPhone

237
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:51,423
So what they done if they found ways to basically send evil SMS

238
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
IPhone

239
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,775
And this will then load

240
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
The arbitrary

241
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,615
Write code that is written by the attacker

242
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,967
I despise by these corporate intelligence agencies whatever

243
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,063
I'm by Fu Nobody by the Saudis in the case of

244
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,391
I swear Jamal khashoggi

245
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,415
Circle of contacts

246
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,535
And this will allow them to take over your phone to the point that

247
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
You know you carry around

248
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
In your pocket

249
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
You paid for it

250
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
A Benelli attacker they own it

251
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
I can turn the camera on they can turn the microphone off

252
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,591
I can get all of your contacts and yet everything that you saved all of your

253
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:37,247
Messages of a file that's on the phone and they can take it back home and they can get constant updates whatever's on the screen you know they can

254
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
Screenshot of it anytime

255
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,367
And they can see what you were doing in this the new state of play

256
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,999
And until we see apple really pick up the pace here to harden

257
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,071
On these basic functions hopefully the new iOS

258
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,911
I'm in really change the way I message horses

259
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,703
Stop incoming text

260
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,031
This is going to be an ongoing problem and it's really dangerous

261
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,847
Apple iPhones reviews

262
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,151
Basically by everybody

263
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,807
Journalism in journalism and in government and policy right

264
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
Kind of Rich they seem to like iPhones

265
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:19,231
Speaking of press Freedom there's something that's happened recently in the news

266
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
Was Jonas songs which I know a lot of

267
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,535
People

268
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,095
Immediately thought of you as well cuz you know it

269
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,143
As you are you're in Asylum right now

270
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,751
Julian Assange the founder of the anti-secrecy organization WikiLeaks

271
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,799
Was arrested this morning in London

272
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,615
7 years after taking refuge in an embassy there

273
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,223
The United States will seek his extradition on federal charges unsealed this morning

274
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,831
In connection with an enormous League of American intelligence nearly a decade ago

275
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
What was your perspective on

276
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
How

277
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:52,255
The US media has been dealing with this situation in particular and

278
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
How do you think this affects

279
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
Press freedom

280
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,143
I mean I I think it's really disheartening to see this happen

281
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
Number

282
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,727
When someone when you look at the timeline

283
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Behind

284
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
Chisme Ecuador's decision

285
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,615
To revoke a sign

286
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
From Julian Assange in the first place

287
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,575
They got a loan from the IMF for some ridiculous amount

288
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
4.2 billion dollars

289
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
At one month

290
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
Before they they

291
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
I'm ended the week after

292
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,119
Julian has been kicked out of the embassy right and taking off to prison

293
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
For all his work

294
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
With the Chelsea Manning disclosures back

295
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,871
We have Ecuador's president going to the United States

296
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
So to get a pat on the back and you don't nice

297
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,199
Job

298
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
15 years

299
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,623
Journalists who've been covering the store that you aren't really looking at that

300
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,719
Because Julian I'm as an individual is it such a tragic

301
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Sloth

302
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,887
Figure out me before and I still don't agree with what's been happening to him

303
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:05,983
So for people who have been phone cases

304
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,055
It is really unusual because when people think of

305
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,151
A Julian Assange and you know a lot of Americans now hate you

306
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
And even though

307
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,295
People who are on the center to the left part of the spectrum

308
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,367
I have been singing his Praises during the Bush Administration

309
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
Now they're on the other side because

310
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
Political choice

311
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Election

312
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,071
But his is journalism right though

313
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,863
It is quite difficult

314
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,959
I think criticized because it look when you talk about

315
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
The emails that played such a big story in that

316
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
Election cycle

317
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,639
These were reported on by basically every major

318
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
Everybody

319
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,479
This wasn't just a weekly leaks

320
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,295
The New York Times Washington Post Der Spiegel

321
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
Everybody

322
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Cupboard

323
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,903
Because it was a profound

324
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
Publican

325
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:02,559
It wasn't even a question these words for the hidden workings of power in the story said things like

326
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
The DNC right

327
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
At the core of the democratic

328
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,727
Formal Democratic party infrastructure

329
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:15,871
I had sort of a lined in secret to rig the primary against Bernie Sanders

330
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,015
And it's not that you don't no one imagined that was possible a lot of people believed

331
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,575
I thought that was the case but no one could actually

332
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Prove it

333
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,647
Right now until you have some kind of documentation

334
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,975
And this this is the kind of thing we're like

335
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,815
Regardless of whether you like it or not

336
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:39,167
Disagree with the election

337
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,983
Journalists are not supposed to throw in

338
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,591
It's the sort of one side and I think this is one of the criticism

339
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,199
Is people rightfully see him as very much against

340
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Because they have a history

341
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,623
It's so difficult to see how they can justify this charge at this moment

342
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,207
In the absence of what is

343
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,511
Obvious which is that the political winds

344
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,815
Turned against Julian Assange is an individual

345
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
He's very much disliked

346
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,423
And that makes it very unpopular.

347
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,263
Temperature last very much need to sort of

348
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,103
Hold their nose and do this even though they don't like the guy personally

349
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,919
I'm because if you say that the entanglement

350
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,479
Status causes and the problems it creates

351
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
Because when you look at this chart

352
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:30,367
What the government has actually charged

353
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,951
It's something that has been publicly known for nearly a decade

354
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,559
I'm the chat logs of the sort of famous Exchange

355
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,607
Between Chelsea Manning

356
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
Who was the source of the

357
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Clojure

358
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:49,823
And someone who is alleged to be joining a van but was actually using a secure an anonymous messenger

359
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
Call jabber using

360
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
Protocol come off the Record

361
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:00,063
Actually supposed to provide a capabilities

362
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,135
It's trivial to forge these chat logs

363
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
But anyway putting putting that aside

364
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,887
You even if you believe this is a Smoking Gun it says you know Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange in the foyer

365
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
Lawyer with the candlestick

366
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,959
The crime that their alleged

367
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
That they're alleging happened

368
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Is Chelsea Manning

369
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
I took what it's called a password

370
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,943
Which is basically just that end in coded

371
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,503
I'm other password

372
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,575
So it's not just you know

373
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,391
Written on a hard drive like you know

374
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,183
You know you don't have

375
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,255
Kitty mittens written anywhere on the hard drive is stuck

376
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,327
To be able to reverse that

377
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,935
By attacking it by breaking its reveal what the actual password is she can use

378
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,311
This was provided by Manning to this person is alleged abuse on

379
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,943
I'm in this person said you know hey I'll take a look at it I'll pass this to my guy who knows something about it

380
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,991
They'll attack and we'll see if we can get in

381
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Right

382
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,879
According to the FBI they're not even sure if it happened

383
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:11,487
No no no no no that was an affidavit

384
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,559
They actually say that it did not happen

385
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,119
I did directly say look they did forensics

386
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,423
On Manning system that this was pulled for

387
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
Are the hash was for a service

388
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
Program to use

389
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,103
For an FTP program

390
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,223
I heard it was not logged into right so they they had not actually succeeded in breaking

391
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
They had not used it

392
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,295
But the government is alleging

393
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,391
Just the sheer fact the mini said hey can you find out what this password is

394
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
And if you can give it back to me

395
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:46,303
You know it is not even release on Jazz idea from that the chat log

396
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,863
I am the DJ is going to look

397
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,167
You know this is a crime where to charge it just the

398
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,471
They call it a password cracking a green

399
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,263
Which is enough

400
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Is enough to indict someone

401
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:01,663
Right right even if it's not used to it to get access to more classified material

402
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,735
I am the government says they believed it was only used

403
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,831
At the store cover Manning's track many didn't want to be logging in with like

404
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:14,207
Username Chelsea Manning right and doing whatever so they wanted to use the swerve Anonymous account

405
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
To do it

406
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Cheers

407
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,095
Here's why I think this is such a problem

408
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
What we have

409
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,703
Is an allegation from the doj

410
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
Julian Assange was a

411
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,335
Part of a conspiracy

412
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,127
To break a law

413
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:38,527
Right and this is actually when you think about the wall right this is actually a pretty low-level infraction

414
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,855
Relative to the things the scientific you stuff in his life

415
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
Yeah

416
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
And then

417
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,255
Even though they're saying they have conspired to break this law

418
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
It didn't actually happen

419
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
For whatever reason

420
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,143
Fake because of incompetence whatever reason

421
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:59,519
They weren't successful in actually committing the crime but the conspiracies enough now

422
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,359
There's another big story in the news right now you might have heard

423
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,151
Call the Mueller report

424
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,943
I was about to ask your take on it

425
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:13,599
Right until the meeting of the Mueller report is so you know there's two big parts of it as I understand and I have already

426
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,928
12 hours at least we

427
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,536
Vice news Reddit all in one shot and I think of Mac broadcast

428
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
Pretty liars

429
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:27,168
And I'm about it

430
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,496
Actually read the whole thing

431
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:34,848
The broad outlines are pretty well agreed on

432
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,688
The few people I suppose you have read this and you know

433
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,736
Analyzing it for the rest of us normal

434
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,576
And so they said the report breaks down into two parts

435
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,160
What is a sort of the Russian side right which is about

436
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,976
Russian electoral interference which is basically

437
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,768
Like trolls

438
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:56,864
Posting stupid Facebook ads and like bad memes on Twitter

439
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,192
To try to change boats you know but

440
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:05,568
They had like a low-budget they didn't reach out that much but like every definitely trying is what the reporter

441
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
But they can't sort of

442
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,128
And that's a true

443
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Okay whatever

444
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:15,808
Then the other side is the sort of hacking and leaking thing where they're saying look the emails from 2016

445
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,880
Our source by their Legend Russian military

446
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,160
Very intelligent

447
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,768
Another thing this was passed after Wikileaks what's interesting about this

448
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,352
It's not charging with this

449
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:32,192
The government saying you know they don't have any evidence the weekend things to do

450
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
It was Russian military intelligence

451
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
What's the time

452
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:41,408
Russian military intelligence got it but they sent it to WikiLeaks WikiLeaks

453
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:48,576
I'm bringing the campfire connections Trump so they like alright well you know it it sucks nobody likes and but

454
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
We can't name them

455
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,928
But then there's this whole second half of the report

456
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
Are entirely separate crime

457
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,256
Right which is the crime of obstruction

458
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
I'm in on this side

459
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,632
The special counsel

460
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
10 separate instances

461
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
I think

462
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,288
I'm weird appears that Trump or people in his administration

463
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,336
I'm are basically

464
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,896
Conspiring to obstruct Justice

465
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
What

466
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:19,040
Are the special counsel does not conclude again like pin this to Trump

467
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
Is breaking the law

468
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,672
It is very interesting way given the context of what we talked about

469
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
They look

470
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:32,096
Trump absolutely ordered all these people in for his for a free to shut down right

471
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,144
Fire Mueller he tried to get rid of

472
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,960
And all these other people can't remember was sessions whatever

473
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:41,824
But he tried and he told like his White House counsel he told all these guys

474
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,104
You know stop

475
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,432
The scary time for talk to me you know I shut this thing down

476
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,968
Which is obviously

477
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Obstruction

478
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
Or at least

479
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
Conspiracy to commit

480
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Obstruction

481
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:54,880
But

482
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
It didn't actually result in a UPS truck

483
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,048
Because the people that

484
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,608
Trump order to do this simply ignore

485
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,216
They went off and they told their buddies like Trump is telling me to do crazy things

486
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,032
I'm turn my resignation letter all of these other things

487
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
And so

488
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:17,664
They say you know Donald Trump didn't actually commit obstruction

489
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,712
And so we're not going to charge

490
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
Maybe

491
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
Maybe

492
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,344
There's something in here that Congress wants to bring her whatever but we're not going to

493
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,160
Any attorney general immediately when he saw this

494
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,304
You know who Jesus really sort of carrying water for Trump all over all day long on this issue and oh my God

495
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:40,704
Right right he's like you know spinning the reports doing all these things like what we see this and you know

496
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:46,848
A mother didn't charge this we're not going to charge this you know extraction no collusion whatever

497
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
Let's move on

498
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,920
Isn't that interesting

499
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
Right

500
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,040
The DJ's defense of not charging Trump

501
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:59,392
This case is they say look he tried to commit a crime but he's too haplessness failed

502
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
To actually do

503
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,560
And the same time they're charging you in a song

504
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,376
Under precisely the opposite Theory

505
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:16,032
Julian may not have actually crack the password we don't have any evidence that

506
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,360
We're going to say something that the agreement

507
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:26,272
So this is a real question the two-tiered system of justice why do we have this double standard here where do the president and you try

508
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,880
You can skate right but if you're a journalist of your publisher

509
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:37,280
Particular who's vulnerable because you gone too far out on a limb and now you've lost Outlook support popular theories against you

510
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,816
No one

511
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
No one can argue

512
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,400
At the work that you've done in the past

513
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,680
Hasn't been

514
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,984
Of real publican

515
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,288
Right it may not have been

516
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
Right

517
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,224
But the newspapers are all running the story

518
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,504
These are important

519
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
Where's right these are about

520
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
Real centers of power in the world

521
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,416
Why is it the journalists are being held to higher standard of

522
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
Behavior

523
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
The president

524
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:11,840
Well actually I was I wanted to ask you that cuz it's something I keep noticing online

525
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
Is that there's various intelligence

526
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
People are people who are ex-intelligence

527
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Who just died

528
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Openly

529
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Hate both

530
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,336
You and Julian Assange

531
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,896
With the fire of a thousand burning Suns

532
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:30,784
If it is interesting to me too because these detective also become popularized during this Mueller report

533
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,064
And if you look back

534
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
In 2013

535
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,904
When you made your disclosures

536
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:40,000
The NSA had a well-documented problem recruiting

537
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
Yeah but now

538
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,328
What I find really wild

539
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:49,728
Is we look online on Instagram and like gchq has an Instagram account the CIA

540
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,776
Is tweeting pictures of puppies

541
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
Like

542
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,848
What the f*** is going on

543
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,896
When was the school

544
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:01,760
When did we when did we decide our intelligence agencies can do this

545
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:06,112
I think you see what's happened here the intelligence

546
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
Agencies have drawn the

547
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Conclusion

548
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:12,000
At least from public perspective from

549
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
The backlash

550
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
13 right

551
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096

555
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
I would call the five eyes

556
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:30,432
Inspired to create a secret system of mass

557

Interesting parse Broken Out In Session eyes 2 pack

573
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,672
All these things so they can chop up your communication with everybody else's communication

574
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
And search through them

575
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,512
Interesting

576
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,816
What's a your credit card numbers on the list

577
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,840
Phone numbers always

578
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,888
You're not always that all right

579
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,424
But you send an email

580
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,496
And you mention a name someone who is

581
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
I'm but it actually happened

582
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,152
Things go through

583
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,944
Answer this giants live in an analyst

584
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
Like me sitting Hawaii

585
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:42,112
Are able to parse through this right and you can type anything in the world in anybody's email address anybody's anything

586
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
And it pops up on your screen

587
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,464
I'm innocent when this happened

588
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,816
Everybody me we was like look this is a violation of at least

589
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,120
The US Constitution's Fourth Amendment

590
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,168
We actually had

591
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
Swervo

592
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
The US

593
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,496
District Court

594
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Kiehl's

595
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:03,360
A rule that not only were these programs unlawful

596
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:09,248
I bet they were likely unconstitutional on the basis that means even the Congress tries to change the statute

597
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:10,784
McCants

598
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,904
Flush the case

599
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,184
I'm and they flushed

600
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
The program 2

601
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,976
Try to save

602
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,256
This larger practice

603
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,304
And in the Wake doing

604
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
Write this sort of damage control

605
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,424
They went maybe the real story 2013 isn't

606
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,520
If we got caught breaking the law we got caught violating everybody's rights and solution

607
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:38,176
Instead we're going to do is we're going to try to change the laws to be more flexible more comedy

608
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,736
Out of the same time

609
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
What we really have

610
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
Here is a PRS

611
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,600
We have a friend of miss you

612
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,024
And so yes this is what you said they get Twitter accounts that get Instagram accounts and puppies and everything like that

613
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,328
They want to be friendly they want to be on your side

614
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,144
Answer the Trump presidency has very much been

615
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
Guest

616
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
Unto these people

617
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Deep state

618
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
You could call it

619
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,824
John has been quite quiet

620
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Since this Mueller report

621
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:13,760
Finally he's got nothing to say no no moralistic diatribes to throw

622
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,552
How to tweet at at the president

623
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,648
All right so he's he's immediately sort of scampered back on the blog

624
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:23,744
Because he was all over Network news although the corporate media

625
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,792
Contributor only shows now

626
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096
I'm where he's using

627
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,656
Service dismantle

628
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,960
Authority that people presume

629
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:38,592
From having you know a little lower third as you get introduced on the new show that says you don't former director CIA

630
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,688
I need just insinuated all this stuff about how

631
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,296
He's in bed with the Russians and he knows it's coming Mueller's got it

632
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
He's going to nail this guy

633
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,136
And then you have to report comes out every way

634
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
Wait I thought

635
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
You said

636
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,608
Yes I thought you had some sort of secret knowledge that this was all going down

637
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,496
I need my money is that you have these characters of popped up and drain the reporting in 2013 I think

638
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,824
You know quite rightly a lot of mainstream media

639
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
And journalist were

640
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,456
We're investigating and looking at these figures and what they've been doing in the last few years

641
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,272
And then suddenly I remember feeling like

642
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
Being a weirdo

643
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
Parallel universe

644
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,904
Now this person theme Champion Don Colbert

645
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,952
And everyone's just

646
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,792
Everyone in their in their in their their rush to two

647
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
To go after Trump

648
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
Just decided to

649
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,424
Accept any and anybody

650
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
2

651
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
Contucci that it was

652
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,360
Kind of you know you looking at the Modern mediascape

653
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,640
You got a Wonder

654
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,432
Where is the political affiliation

655
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
What's going on

656
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:54,368
All right I mean this is this is kind of one of the things actually that gets back to the Sunshine for which he'll never be

657
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
Forgiving people

658
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,696
Focus so much on the song

659
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,232
And they forget what's real

660
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,512
Which is

661
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
Why was the son's noteworthy

662
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
Why was he in for

663
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
Why does nobody care

664
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,960
About this weird Australian guy

665
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,008
Who is trapped in an embassy

666
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
Brighton in London

667
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,848
I'm an Indian surf courses

668
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Cheap printed thing

669
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,944
The people needed to know

670
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,224
All the people wanted to know

671
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,272
But the larger should have

672
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,064
Maurice Moore corporate media

673
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
Would not touch

674
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,464
And this was because of fears of backlash because of you know this Saturday.

675
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm but

676
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,816
Whenever somebody else breaks the story first

677
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,120
Then the world Taiwan right because it

678
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,496
I'm we actually saw that the same kind of

679
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,824
The same kind of dynamic

680
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,640
With the Steele dossier

681
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
All right which was all the salacious things

682
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
About Donald Trump

683
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,528
I'm where it have been shopped around all these news Oregon

684
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,160
None of them would actually report on that go again

685
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,976
Credible is not credible until BuzzFeed

686
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,560
Put it on the one did it than everybody was talking about right

687
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,608
But there was also a problem here

688
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,144
Which is

689
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
We have

690
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
So much today

691
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,312
The journalism and politics

692
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,384
Accusation

693
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,688
Rather than actual evidence

694
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,296
What are the things that is I think quite disappointing to see about the money

695
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:32,672
I'm for both sides by people who want to bury Trump and people who want you to put them up on there

696
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,464
The shoulders and racing down the street

697
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,256
Tour the parade

698
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,816
Is there snow evidence

699
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,376
There's a ton of alligator

700
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:45,984
But they don't actually say this is you know why we believe

701
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,032
This this is the source of it

702
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
So we can look at the actual facts

703
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:56,224
The same thing with Steele dossier right eye one of the reasons why it was so problematic to post that why

704
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
A cause a backlash when it stopped

705
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:03,392
I'm with the media who very much like rightfully the public

706
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,952
The public wanted to see Trump

707
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,512
Because his is policies

708
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
Even some

709
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
I will acknowledge

710
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,680
I did his character is morality just isn't one of these

711
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:20,288
It's simply not there

712
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,384
There are people out there

713
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,688
With red hats on right now

714
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,992
Arthur glad don't understand power

715
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:33,856
Right there glad Republicans are power will do anything to keep the last Democrats out of power

716
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:38,464
And look you know they pick their side they have their politics might not agree with it whatever

717
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
Albert at least Leafs

718
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
Even those people

719
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
Right

720
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,656
I'm even those people who are totally on something just because they want the power

721
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,448
Look at Donald Trump

722
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,984
And I go look this guy's a dick

723
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
Right we know he's

724
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,592
We know he's a bad person

725
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,128
Our

726
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
Terrible

727
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
Person

728
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,272
We've seen this happening and you know country after country after country

729
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:07,648
Iuc with erdogan in turkey and I know you see it with or Bond and hungry see with Putin in Russia right

730
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,952
I'm where these guys don't look

731
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,256
We no disguises feeling

732
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
We think he's an effect

733
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,584
Our

734
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
In in this case in the trunk AC stuff

735
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:24,032
Abilities kind of a bumbleride but he does have us or power

736
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,592
But the problem is

737
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,176
When you just like so much

738
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
That you're willing to set evidence

739
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,064
To the side and simply believe any bad thing about

740
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,624
Because you think it advances your cause

741
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,672
York remastered vulnerabilities

742
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
Because if it is not

743
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
One of Donald Trump's

744
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,072
You

745
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,888
Very effective political attacks for his side

746
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
Expect

747
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,472
Sprite is saying the people

748
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:57,824
My opponents the people on the other side read the people who want to change in government

749
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,872
They are liars

750
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,200
But they are Fabricators they're inventing things

751
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,504
To manipulate

752
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:10,624
But it's scary though because what you have now

753
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
Is MattyB putz's

754
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
If you talk a lot about this

755
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
That

756
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:17,792
You know this Mel report in the reporting around it

757
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,352
Is basically this Generations wmds

758
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
Because ultimately

759
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
It was nothing

760
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,472
And

761
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,056
The trust I think that it did any damage

762
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:29,824
Done

763
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,128
I really I wonder

764
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,712
Going forward in my profession how we can sort of undo some of that

765
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
So that guy

766
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,528
Directions to Racine and mistrust

767
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
In readers and viewers

768
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,928
I think it's a little bit generous to say nothing

769
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:51,328
Write it in something

770
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,656
Occlusion The Smoking Gun

771
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,984
Promise

772
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:03,872
A new it exactly active conspiracy with the Russian government rights

773
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,664
Like a plot

774
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,944
Stop it he's going to do all this

775
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,968
Changes

776
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
Sanctioned

777
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,808
They had made Deals they have

778
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:17,440
Incapable morons like Carter page right

779
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,512
Who can't interview

780
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:26,912
Without you know like it just breaking out into the most guilty looking sporkful in like Flynn

781
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,984
How

782
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
Either they're not the 80

783
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:38,432
But these individuals write these are the ones who we have folks like Rachel Maddow have a tremendous

784
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Turns out

785
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,040
Even the redacted version of the Mueller report

786
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,600
Is like a really good Ragu

787
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,160
It's just better the second day

788
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:52,000
And it's not just her right but she she gets singled out a lot and sometimes unfairly

789
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,048
But sometimes very fairly

790
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,376
Because of the aggression in the singular Focus

791
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,912
On a story

792
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,448
Ian with the evidence

793
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,752
This is that concept again

794
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:06,080
There's evidence for because they stopped

795
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:11,712
Caring about evidence it became a struggle against an idiot logical Battle of Truth

796
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Light

797
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,528
Injustice versus the

798
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
Forces of Darkness

799
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,112
Rather than look these are the facts

800
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,464
We need to follow the facts and get to what we can prove

801
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,768
To hold these people to the full account of the law

802
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,608
And instead what we have is if we have a kind of tribalism

803
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,168
It is corroding and breaking down

804
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,984
Bonza fraternity there's time together every society

805
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,008
Write this is happening

806
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
States

807
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
France

808
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,616
Xiaomi UK

809
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,296
But even within that like people are

810
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,832
They are

811
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
Ceasing

812
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
To believe

813
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,488
That we can even operate from a common set of facts

814
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
Because we are denying

815
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
What is true

816
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,400
Annie's provable because it is contrary to

817
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:06,240
Our purpose is Our intention right our our our sort of

818
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
Outside of the battle

819
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
And we are

820
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Fabricate

821
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,408
The fact that we believe Survivor arguing

822
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,224
And when that happens on both sides right

823
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,296
We lose the ability to have any kind of rational

824
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
Kind of

825
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:24,416
Alice exchange where we can actually

826
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,952
Work together

827
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,768
I mean we can find a consensus and go look

828
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,584
I don't agree with you

829
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
I will oppose you

830
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,424
I will try to achieve my goals but

831
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:40,032
I will recognize that what you were doing is it least based

832
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
The truth

833
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,920
I don't want to say you know Trump is a victim of this because he is

834
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,992
Very much one of the champions of of modern untruths

835
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,064
I'm but the sad thing there the reality is

836
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,856
He is getting hit

837
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,160
With the same thing that he create

838
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,464
Right I'm in the problem is

839
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:03,584
If he was just getting his just deserts right in his sort of

840
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,888
Journeys reward

841
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,472
People might be okay with that why they might think it's karmic Justice right

842
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,520
But once you started that

843
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
What is Pandora's Box

844
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
You can't put it back in

845
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,872
No one trusts

846
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:21,504
NBC or CNN

847
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
This is the thing

848
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
Who do you trust

849
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,392
Who can you trust environment is motherboard

850
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,208
Every sentence

851
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
Motherboard

852
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,144
Wwd

853
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:45,312
I get called on on Twitter quot off and I got called a terrorist and a traitor because I'm now I mean

854
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
Court right now is the

855
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,896
RCMP in Canada because I refused

856
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
2

857
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
Comply

858
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,480
So far with a production order

859
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,832
To give up all this information on a dead Isis Source actually I'm going I'm going to

860
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,600
Court

861
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,136
This week or X

862
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
It'll be airing on the dad

863
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
Acoma Court

864
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,512
And I also I just I wonder sometimes

865
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,864
You know I I also do a lot of work on far right and I get

866
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,656
I get people calling me

867
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
You know

868
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,472
SELECTED store

869
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,312
You know I can't go anywhere it's just on Twitter I just get attacked

870
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,360
On either side of airport in the far-right

871
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,920
Or a report on on on terrorist because

872
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,456
Jaundice

873
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
Because

874
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,528
There just seems to be such a pendulum

875
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
And nobody believes

876
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:36,256
I think you know I'm part of this there there's an observation bias but there's also definitely change in public narrative

877
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,536
In a way that we can I

878
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Play nowadays

879
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
I'm one of the

880
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,656
Biggest mistakes of the media

881
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,936
Dwight

882
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,472
Need a ride from from

883
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:50,848
Small-time independent Bloggie folks to the the biggest plush in a million-dollar

884
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,128
Salaries

885
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,151
Newsroom

886
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,991
Every time Trump has tweeted something

887
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
They've made it news

888
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,295
How they react to it

889
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:04,671
Right right right

890
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,743
They have explainers about like what Twitter is right

891
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:12,095
I'm so now your grandparents your parents your kids you know you niece and nephew

892
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,631
Everybody's going on Twitter

893
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,935
Because I want to see what it's all about right

894
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,471
And so if

895
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,519
The demographics of Twitter hitch

896
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,847
Right now everybody's on that and that has been representation

897
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,151
People who are

898
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:30,271
Did you're not invested in the community like they don't have any sort of connection to that

899
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,551
Are there new arrivals

900
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:36,671
And this is something that like you have to accept you have to absorb you have to understand

901
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
But I don't think

902
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,351
Any of the public figures that have been so comfortable on Twitter the last couple years

903
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,239
Directions thought about then realized what's happening day just seen a become harsher and harsher and harsher

904
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:55,871
People who aren't used to this they're not like there's a whole new influx of Holland population that's looking

905
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,455
I'm on on that note

906
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,527
I think if you're not getting criticized

907
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
From both

908
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Indus

909
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,903
Atmosphere where everything is hyper-partisan

910
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
You're not being

911
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
Fair

912
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,791
Because it's a journalist I think who has a real commitment to

913
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,327
Simply what the fox say

914
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:18,911
As opposed to what the desired narrative is

915
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,215
Journalist for Their audience

916
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,543
You're going to piss everybody off everytime you

917
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,871
Story or you know maybe this story won't do it for the money right next

918
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,895
Weak will

919
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,711
I'm in this site I think is

920
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
It's unfortunate

921
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:38,111
Did we have an audience know who takes everything personally but

922
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
The question is can you blame them

923
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
When you look at whatsapp

924
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,487
Happened with this

925
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
Oh you know

926
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Effort

927
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
To sort of unseat trump from the White House

928
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,423
I threw this Russian conspiracy narrative

929
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
It clearly didn't pan out

930
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:57,055
You know now he even the Democrats write the Democratic Party

931
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:02,431
Who hates this guy will do anything to be thrown them is going all right when we struck out of Russia but

932
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,247
Obstruction we're going to get him on that right

933
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,295
And okay fine you know whatever but

934
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,343
We have to have some accountability

935
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
The fact

936
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,719
We have had the chairs

937
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,047
Congressional intelligence committee

938
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,351
Open the house and the Senate

939
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,215
Who are doing the same things as the John Brennan's as but James clapper's

940
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
We're basically going to look

941
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
Kind of top secret clearance

942
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,847
If you knew what I knew

943
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,407
You know you be ready to slap cuffs on this guy

944
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:35,967
Abaddon the report comes out and everybody's like where's the

945
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,319
What do you want to ask you speaking of journalistic

946
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,087
Institutions

947
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,159
Were you disappointed to see when the intercept

948
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
Close down

949
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
Discord archive

950
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,351
I think the most disappointing thing about this

951
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,167
I was the fact that I learned about it from the news

952
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,447
Like look

953
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,727
I am

954
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
I

955
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
I'm not

956
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
A journalist

957
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,615
I don't work at The Intercept I'm not

958
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,407
On the board Explorer slow

959
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
They Don't Own Me

960
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,807
And I understand right

961
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,111
Are there also not the sole custodian something

962
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,671
Barton gellman of the Washington Post

963
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,719
He's got a copy

964
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,791
The New York Times has copies Garden has copies to

965
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,583
The speaker has copies right this is distribute

966
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,143
All these other news organizations have stopped

967
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,679
Publishing for years

968
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,495
Because it became more expensive in longer for more

969
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,799
Instead of like the short

970
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,847
Punching news pieces

971
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,455
Which is what you know the large appetite is in an in journalism today

972
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,759
What remains in the archive I believe

973
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:46,111
It is stuff that is going to require much more substantial effort

974
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,159
Basically

975
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
Book

976
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
Text work

977
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,231
What you need real researchers

978
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
Sit down

979
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,863
I'm in to connect all the dots that you can't get across and send them

980
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
50 words right

981
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,191
And

982
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:03,775
The Intercept really was not designed for that

983
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,311
Unfortunately

984
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,895
None of these news organizations were and they were supposed to hand this off

985
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,199
At academic institutions

986
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,783
But that just hasn't happened because the academic insta

987
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
Look

988
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,927
We're dependent on grants from the federal government in the US

989
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:28,351
The word the government's Kino going to complain and go over you know you're giving this

990
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
So whoever

991
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:33,983
I'm into I am sympathetic and I understand that waves their hands

992
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
At the same time

993
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:39,871
Oh yeah I don't think it would have been a lot to sit for you to ask for Haiti

994
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:46,271
Give me a call maybe maybe ask my my feelings on it

995
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
And I am

996
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,063
Understand where it's at

997
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,343
But yeah you know

998
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,135
I I think anybody would agree

999
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,719
Quick signal text are you can Skype

1000
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,279
Right right

1001
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,607
I'm sure they would be just a ton of NSA all over that but

1002
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,655
You know I'm sure you're also used to that as well

1003
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,935
Hey Ya

1004
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:10,847
I mean it it's not like I'm you know in hiding that that's the funny thing.

1005
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,615
People are always like

1006
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,687
Edward Snowden from an undisclosed

1007
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,783
I'm in my apartment guys in Moscow I say this all the time.

1008
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:25,439
I'm not going to tell you my street address I don't want you to know where I live right by you don't know now you know your street address either

1009
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:31,839
No I definitely don't feel no way I live you don't want your audience feel like all I didn't like that story

1010
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,375
Yeah and I'm not I mean

1011
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,911
Famous I'm like you know

1012
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:41,055
Have a podcast that's what I mean by that is

1013
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:47,455
No I'm actually living a much more public and open life now so you know I'm doing interview with you right now

1014
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,783
Copy this calling almost certain

1015
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,623
Do you know when you saw the Assange thing go down

1016
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,927
Did you get a little like roof

1017
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,719
I really don't want that to happen to me

1018
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:03,327
No it was more the case where

1019
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,655
You know I I I told you before my plan

1020
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,959
Event end up in Ecuador

1021
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Right

1022
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:19,455
If John Kerry and cancel my passport because he thought it would be an effective political attack track in Russia

1023
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:23,295
I can think it's sort of smear be by association for the rest of my life

1024
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,623
You know I would be in Guantanamo right now worked at

1025
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,183
I probably won't even made it

1026
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
The point of the CIA

1027
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,743
Hand in Latin

1028
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,583
That was really the sort of more what I thought

1029
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,143
You know that the whole thing is it's not

1030
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,679
Really about me

1031
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,471
And this is the thing with the most rust

1032
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,263
We have these conversations with

1033
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,591
Anybody

1034
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,615
Because I'm afraid

1035
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
Xiamen name that people run

1036
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,663
Recognize right

1037
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,223
They're always sympathetic and I understand is a human intro

1038
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,527
England it didn't come from me right now

1039
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:59,135
Isn't my political advisors right there always like oh you know you want people to connect

1040
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,671
Think positively of you

1041
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,975
Look guys I don't matter

1042
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,815
Right that the only thing I did that it was a real you know

1043
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,095
Significant impact

1044
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,911
With sourcing this information to

1045
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:15,263
Like I lost it by the time I was out of the hotel room

1046
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
Route Hong Kong

1047
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,591
And

1048
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,919
From that point on right like I can be an activist

1049
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,967
Boys I can talk on the sidelines

1050
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,015
Humble what happens to me

1051
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,551
Doesn't really matter

1052
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
However

1053
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
From my side

1054
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,159
The reason I came

1055
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:37,535
Time for drive is not to make a better life for myself I I live on firing and really screwed myself

1056
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,911
But it was the customer something I believed in right which is a we were going in the wrong direction

1057
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,959
Stay that way

1058
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Orkin Roach

1059
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
Writing in history

1060
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,311
And we have a chance to

1061
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,871
Turn toward what we see everybody doing right

1062
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,711
The whole reason we see this public embrace

1063
00:49:56,223 --> 00:50:01,087
Ivaldis spies and you know former CIA chief

1064
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,135
What would presume to be liberal

1065
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,951
Channels and outlets in newspapers

1066
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,279
And you know their there they're sort of glorifying

1067
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
These people

1068
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,863
They're doing it very utilitarian way

1069
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,399
Miami

1070
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,959
I'm afraid of what my enemy

1071
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
With the power

1072
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,055
I'm afraid with the future will look like

1073
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,359
I'm afraid that the world is dangerous

1074
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,895
And so I will make a

1075
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,479
Anyone who says they can help

1076
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,039
Anyone who says they can fight

1077
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,135
And that's what these people are doing right but what happens is

1078
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,439
Now we have given so much power

1079
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
An agency

1080
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,815
Applecore literally trained

1081
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,863
To lie and sweet

1082
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,631
Burnt

1083
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,703
And basically damage

1084
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,567
Democratic and Republic processes

1085
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,895
Or sort of elite institutions

1086
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,199
Remember the Office of the President

1087
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
Right

1088
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,247
The White House

1089
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,087
Is not an expression democracy after the election

1090
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,111
I think it's

1091
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,903
They have been granted powers

1092
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,487
But this is now in the hands of a group and its

1093
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,791
New Chanel executive branch

1094
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,607
Who is very much going to use this to political ends

1095
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,143
And we would like to believe

1096
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:23,263
But they will use it for the purposes of the benefits of the public that has elected

1097
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,823
In a lot of cases to do

1098
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,663
What from the best to the worst presidency

1099
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
They have

1100
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,455
All

1101
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,247
Obama abused

1102
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,039
Bush abused Trump is setting

1103
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
Records on abusing it

1104
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,879
Right now I'm sure if you look back at you Nick Carter

1105
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,671
Jimmy Carter did crust

1106
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,439
Thanks

1107
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,767
Are you are you a Bernie 2020 guy

1108
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:52,191
You know I I don't endorse any candidates because I feel like eating and I worried that it might be a kiss of death

1109
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,727
Where them cause more

1110
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,519
More harm than good

1111
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:59,103
I'll say about Sanders here

1112
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,479
Is that when you look at all of the people Democrat

1113
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
CDs

1114
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,807
Certified

1115
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,343
Corporate Democrats you know

1116
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,391
The Harris Booker

1117
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,671
40 gigs

1118
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,303
And all these guys are are are fairly Corp

1119
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:22,399
Right are you got Warren who's you know a little bit less corporate

1120
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,703
And that's encouraging

1121
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,263
But you also see the machine very much

1122
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
Aimed against

1123
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:33,919
Sanders and Warren even though that they seem to have a little bit of friction between them

1124
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
For the same spot on the ticket

1125
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,807
The thing that I like about

1126
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,599
Some of these folks

1127
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,391
Starrett particularly

1128
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,695
When you look at someone like Sanders

1129
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
Is you know what they believe

1130
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,703
You know if you look at every crisis if you look at every problem if you look at every foreign policy views that the United

1131
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,751
Places in Fulton for the last 50 years

1132
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,335
This picture of Bernie Sanders at a protest

1133
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,895
INF 30 years ago

1134
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
Screaming.

1135
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,247
And I think

1136
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,551
When you get to that age

1137
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,599
And you have that kind of established

1138
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
Track record

1139
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,647
Angle look

1140
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,975
I don't agree with all the man's policies he might have things that are different

1141
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,047
But at least I understand who that person is

1142
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,375
And that is not something that you can say

1143
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,423
I swear a lot of these candidates

1144
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,239
Who their policies and in their beliefs

1145
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,287
Are are very much purchase

1146
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,567
And sponsor

1147
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:36,639
And I think that

1148
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,687
Is the kind of politics

1149
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,503
That has led us to a trump presidency

1150
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,831
So one last question that is

1151
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
You know it's

1152
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,671
Pretty controversial for you I know you've tweeted about in the past and

1153
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,999
Heart of Nubian internationally-renowned whistleblower

1154
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
But I know that you

1155
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,071
Used to get weird

1156
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,607
Spicy photographs

1157
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,399
On Twitter in your DMs

1158
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,191
That's still happening

1159
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
You know

1160
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:08,895
It's that has mostly dried up I think because I'm out of the headlines which is nice

1161
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:14,271
You do you do still get them sometimes I'm but it's actually a little bit

1162
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,807
A little bit sad

1163
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,855
It's not something

1164
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,927
And that surprises it's it's from people who have I died

1165
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,695
Pretty up

1166
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,231
Mental health issues

1167
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:26,559
And that's the you know that that's part of the internet

1168
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
Is

1169
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,863
You got all kinds of people out there

1170
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:33,727
And it might you know it it might be the kind of thing that you make a joke about

1171
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,007
It's funny because

1172
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
And I understand

1173
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,663
When we think about what the end

1174
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,991
It is the new public,

1175
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,271
That's right it is the street

1176
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,623
When you look at the street when you look at the bus when you look at the subway today

1177
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:57,279
Nobody looks at each other nobody's talking to each other unless they're going with each other they've been brought their own crowd

1178
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,583
Instead of looking down at screens

1179
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:03,423
And it is these screens that connect people out to the world

1180
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:08,031
And while that is both a means of interconnection and engagement

1181
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,847
Not everybody has the skills

1182
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:16,735
And just at the General Health and the good privilege

1183
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
Of the way

1184
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,855
This word characteristics they enjoy psychologically

1185
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:26,463
But they can handle this and so they end up becoming more isolated and then become more delusional

1186
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,511
And they turn to violence

1187
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
Or self-harm

1188
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,655
And I think there's not alot ways for people nowadays

1189
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,935
Get that kind of help

1190
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,799
And I'm not sure we're going to see that get better

1191
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,335
Until we as a c

1192
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
Society improve

1193
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,687
In a real way politically because right now

1194
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,527
These are the topics of conversation that nobody

1195
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,807
Talk about that nobody

1196
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,831
Cares about because

1197
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,111
The world is on fire

1198
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,415
I lied

1199
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
One Last Cry

1200
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,535
If you don't mind but I know you probably have some

1201
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,583
Dumplings to get to or something like that

1202
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,911
What's in vodka

1203
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:12,287
Hey how about some pizza

1204
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,567
Russian Pizza

1205
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,591
You can eat it or Miss

1206
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:21,759
I'm an American man you know they got like Papa John's

1207
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:26,367
C-man

1208
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,231
Start just one last question

1209
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
Was it you were tweeting about it

1210
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
A few weeks ago

1211
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,119
Have to do with dark matter

1212
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:44,287
It turns out the Lori Stroud who is the one that brought you to the NSA and in Hawaii

1213
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,359
Has been public publicly denouncing dark

1214
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:50,431
I was just wondering what you thought about that

1215
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,247
So there's

1216
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:57,599
There's a little bit of complexity to that story Lori Stroud

1217
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,415
Is represented a lot of these stories is like being my

1218
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,183
My boss

1219
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
This that and the other

1220
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,023
Am I believe she signed form

1221
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,607
I did was to get the referral bonus

1222
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:12,191
About my boss actually set in a different room

1223
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,471
Was not

1224
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
Stroud

1225
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:19,615
I I did know Laura Stroud and you don't seem like a decent enough person I do know our

1226
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,431
I'm very well because we only worked

1227
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
Weeks

1228
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
That was my last

1229
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
Before I left

1230
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,575
But it's it's

1231
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,671
It's good that someone is coming forward

1232
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,231
Bostonia Public Record about what

1233
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:40,095
At the same thing time I think it is profoundly troubling

1234
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,887
2cp

1235
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,447
A crew working

1236
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,727
With the NSA

1237
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,519
Stop.

1238
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:54,175
To basically use Mass surveillance because the team that I was working with her mom wasn't masturbating

1239
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,527
We take those skills

1240
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,575
And that understanding

1241
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,647
And then basically sell them rent them out

1242
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,463
To the most authoritarian regimes in the Middle East

1243
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,255
I'd use them

1244
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,583
Against human rights Defender

1245
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,887
Right and journalist and activist

1246
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,959
End in her public statements

1247
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:20,287
The only time she's actually bothered by

1248
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,871
When she has sent human rights Defenders

1249
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:25,919
In her own words

1250
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,199
To prison

1251
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:30,527
Right and I think they said

1252
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,343
Demands spouse is on like house arrest now

1253
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,879
Monitor by the secret police

1254
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,183
The only time it bothered her

1255
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,719
Was when

1256
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,487
An American

1257
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
Got caught up

1258
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,327
And if the full extent

1259
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,351
Of your

1260
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,143
Moral universe

1261
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:49,983
Is whether good or bad things happen to Americans

1262
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,263
Lights

1263
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,823
Only belong to Americans

1264
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:59,199
I wish I had had more than a few weeks to to send beside a person

1265
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,223
Like that some

1266
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,319
Because I I wish I could have reached

1267
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,695
Well thank you very much for coming on Cyber I really appreciate it

1268
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
It's been a really

1269
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,743
Discussion

1270
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:15,071
Any last-minute advice for me if

1271
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,607
The Acadian federal police

1272
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,399
Say I have to go to jail for this

1273
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,703
Look

1274
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:25,567
I am not going to tell anybody you know marching prisoner or do this Saturday

1275
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,871
But I will say this

1276
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,943
The decisions that

1277
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,967
People like you make

1278
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:35,295
Stand up for

1279
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,319
Fundamental

1280
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:42,463
The are the only thing that constitutes public rights

1281
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:47,327
I'm Yoona freedom of press freedom of speech know what is that stuff mean

1282
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,887
Unless people actually standing

1283
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,655
And that

1284
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:55,007
Your rights are are just letters on a page right there did not going to jump off the page and

1285
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,031
And protect you

1286
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,335
The law doesn't protect people

1287
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,103
People protect

1288
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:01,919
If there are people like you

1289
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,479
Who are willing to stand up and shout

1290
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,759
The government

1291
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,343
When it goes beyond what is permitted what is authorized

1292
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,903
What is able

1293
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
To do

1294
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,999
No one will set

1295
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:19,839
Boundaries and enforce them for the Publix body right

1296
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,887
Relatives the government's

1297
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,423
Asserted privileges

1298
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,263
We aren't living in a free and open

1299
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,103
Society we we don't have rights we have privileges in there

1304
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,343
So very much respect

1305
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:45,439
Are people who are willing not just to say to believe in something

1306
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,975
But actually stand up

1307
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,535
