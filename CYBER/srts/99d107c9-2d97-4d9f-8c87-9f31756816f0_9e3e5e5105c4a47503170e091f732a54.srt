6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,288
Just this once

7
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:51,456
Bobs or vegana whichever will it be set the fuk down is a reason I'm here to spill.

00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
November 50,000 printers started suddenly printing a message urging recipients to subscribe to PewDiePie

10
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Most popular star ever with 80 million subscribers to the printers were hacked

11
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
Because they were dangerously exposed internet the same hacker hacker giraffe

12
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
Again this time I can Smart TVs and Chromecast devices to autoplay a video promoting PewDiePie and

13
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,856
Urging them to fix their exposed devices things only got crazier from there a few days later have a draft

14
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:36,256
Remorseful statement from PewDiePie fans and heaters

15
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
Bi and surface and safety transmission by saying they were hanging up

16
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
How something that started in good fun become so toxic

17
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:55,456
We were talking about the board staff writer Samantha Cole prison following this drama from the beginning

18
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
This is cyber Samantha first time on the show

19
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
And you're going to be on the show right now because you did an article on somebody called

20
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
PewDiePie it's cute that you say it like you don't know who he is

21
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,216
His army which will find out it will not like this but

22
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
I only found out

23
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
About

24
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,336
PewDiePie because I got tweet a few times

25
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
Where someone said

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Somebody looks

27
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
Like if

28
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:32,576
PewDiePie and I had a kid and they were ugly and I kept getting it and I was like who the f***

29
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
Is PewDiePie

30
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,464
And I checked it out and now I know who he is

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,072
I'm sorry for I think it's just because we're both white guys with beards is not exactly like a

32
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
I really like we look alike

33
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,656
Fair enough but I'm bi

34
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
But of course

35
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
Like everything on the show

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
How to let you down a bit of rabbit

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
What happened

38
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,848
Yeah so just to get people in my contacts

39
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,896
Who don't know

40
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
PewDiePie

41
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,760
He is a YouTube most popular

42
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
I got the flogger

43
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
Vlogger

44
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
I don't think so

45
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,952
I feel really dated this a fogger but yeah he's the most popular YouTuber

46
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
Right now he's got he just broke

47
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
80 million subscribers so

48
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
That makes him the most popular ever

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,240
Yeah he's he's a pretty big he was going

50
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
He was doing this like

51
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,360
War with another Channel called T Series which is

52
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
I'm an Indian channel that also has like a ton of subscribers and ever growing really quickly and it was like a big deal like with him and his fans Aiko

53
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,552
Are we going to get

54
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
Passover by T-Series

55
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
So that kind of

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Kicked off like

57
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
But we're going to talk about today wishes

58
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,560
I'm all of his fans kind of crying the other and saying like we have to make sure I like

59
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
P by Cezanne top

60
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
Kind of craziness witch

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,752
Then led to people doing some pretty wacky s*** with

62
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,824
Hacking printers in Smart TVs and stuff

63
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
A very quick to London

64
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:05,504
That's so but he's some sort of like comedians / he also reviews games

65
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,392
The game blogger yeah he does like twitch stream

66
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
Yeah so he's

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
Kind of a personality I guess

68
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,512
So you can call

69
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,327
Any has just like this very committed following us

70
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,143
Ignore that 80 million right

71
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,703
Yeah yeah it's yeah just forget Himalayan salt

72
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,543
Yeah it's quite a bit and people get really

73
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
Really into

74
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Getting

75
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
Part of this community

76
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:33,919
Buy followers

77
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
So in order to keep him on top

78
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
A figure emerges

79
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,599
Hacker giraffe who is the hacker

80
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,135
What a white hat hacker

81
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
Yeah call him a white hat hacker in some of the covers that we've done but just be kind

82
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
Define that term

83
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,655
That's when someone is doing hacking to expose

84
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679
Vulnerability is that

85
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,591
Not necessarily to be malicious but to say like here's what's wrong with your devices are like yours with exposed to the internet

86
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,967
Here's how to fix them that kind of stuff for like it's usually someone's doing it for like

87
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,343
Bug Bounty or like some greater good is involved in this they're not

88
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
Hacking

89
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
Hurt anyone

90
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,487
That's kind of why we call hacker draft that in the article that we write but

91
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,071
It's a little different in his case because he's just kind of

92
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,703
Releasing these things out into the wild

93
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,775
He's taking over people's smart TVs

94
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,847
Printers hundreds of thousands of printers

95
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,919
We're printing PewDiePie like subscribe

96
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Cheats

97
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,991
Paper

98
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:44,575
ASCII art of fist bumps and stuff like that

99
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
It's like pretty fun and funny but it's also really annoying annoying and not really

100
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Are you the smartest

101
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
It's not

102
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
Quite legal

103
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,607
Devices in that way so

104
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
Yeah that's

105
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
The background of

106
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,471
What he's up to

107
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
So he was doing this

108
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
All in an effort

109
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
Keep PewDiePie on top so he was

110
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,871
Essentially

111
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:10,687
Going I'm sure he's doing like sauce cans of the internet

112
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Things

113
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
Seeing what devices are out there that had vulnerabilities

114
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
And then

115
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,367
Putting them in any way could visually or otherwise

116
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
To just say so

117
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Support

118
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
Twerking

119
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
I mean it went

120
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:30,143
Pretty viral you know lots of outlets including us picked it up when it happened

121
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
So yeah I think it worked

122
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,983
I don't know what the actual return on looks

123
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Driver's license

124
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,615
But there's some people tweeting and saying like oh my God like my workplace printer just

125
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Started Lake

126
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Spamming us with

127
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
Chi Phi sheets of

128
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
If her and likes

129
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,087
People were like really concerned when they're like Chromecast we're playing a video that they didn't

130
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,879
Put on there

131
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
And tweeting about it or like

132
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,511
I'm reading about it so I think it worked that way pretty freaky

133
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
But I guess

134
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
If it's just on like

135
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Swedish dude

136
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,679
Yelling about whatever I wouldn't be as

137
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
Freaked out

138
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,287
Yeah that's where it kind of I mean it is

139
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,823
It's supposed to be kind of

140
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
Fun and funny

141
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,663
Kumon oldschoolhack really in a lot of ways

142
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Through this like

143
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Very kind of

144
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:20,063
Old school hacker culture like almost phone freaking or something like that

145
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,367
You know it's not necessarily something really

146
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
Intense and dark

147
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
It's not dark over

148
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
Yeah exactly it's it's

149
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
Harmless

150
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
And that way

151
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,351
But

152
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
So what happened to hacker giraffe

153
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
So that's kind of where this

154
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:42,079
Took a turn for the worst so hacker draft was kind of

155
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:48,479
I mean he wasn't really well-known before this I don't know if you've done it all I had not heard of him before this

156
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
But

157
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,415
Blew up as far as popularity people were by the sudden like

158
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,951
Keyboard

159
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,999
Hammond Eastside of website and like

160
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
Kind of really leaned into this after the printer hack

161
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,423
And had like a little bit of notoriety as far as that

162
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Then got it for it but

163
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,055
Then after the Chromecast

164
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,591
TAG watches in

165
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
December last month

166
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,223
He came out with this long

167
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
I guess there's like a statement

168
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:25,343
MyPay spinner something like about how

169
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,719
He was being threatened and harassed and people are coming after him and

170
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:37,375
I'm frightening his family and all the stuff

171
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Gathered from this

172
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,471
What kind of vague all of his way statement was that

173
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
People who

174
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,335
Didn't like PewDiePie work coming after him and it was just

175
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:52,223
I mean the thing is like it's kind of hard to say why are people why are you harassing phone lines like the reason is because

176
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
This culture is very toxic

177
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
There's not really real reason a lot of the times

178
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
People

179
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
Do

180
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,231
Shity things to each other on the internet

181
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,255
It's a Troll Army versus

182
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,327
The Troll Army exactly I don't know if it was so much like

183
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,423
T-Series vs. PewDiePie if it was just like people getting into this black

184
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,703
Scaffold

185
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
But

186
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,311
I think the last straw for hacker draft was somebody in

187
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,079
Like a

188
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,871
Server somewhere he was chatting with someone

189
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,991
Said that the FBI was like investigating him

190
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,391
Yeah it was eating disorder like someone told me later that it was somewhere else but it started in this court, where he was

191
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
And

192
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
Basically saying that like the FBI is

193
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
Watching you like watch out like

194
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,375
You should really stop like you're being sloppy and he

195
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Totally like

196
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
Freaked out like

197
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,823
I mean it sounds like you know he had like panic attack or something like had like something kind of breakdown where

198
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,943
This was like the last straw and posted this blog and then post a really long

199
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,991
Like 20 minutes

200
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,807
Monologue about howl like he

201
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
Was no longer going to be

202
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,159
Hacking or

203
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
I involved in these pranks are involved with

204
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,535
Stuff anymore just completely scared him off

205
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,863
Most of you are probably wondering what happened

206
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,471
Why suddenly deleted everything and why is going to leave right away

207
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,287
No

208
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
Twitter didn't shut down my account

209
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
No

210
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
Nobody hacked into the account

211
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
And no

212
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Nobody

213
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Got

214
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Nobody

215
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
Nobody came

216
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
And

217
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
I wasn't caught by authorities

218
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
Over the past month

219
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,119
I have gone under this area

220
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
And I have

221
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,447
Given the chance

222
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
2

223
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Finally teach people

224
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
What hacking really is like

225
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
And what

226
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,991
What you can do with hacking and cyber-security I was given this platform and it felt like a miracle

227
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
But for the past month

228
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
My dams have been filled

229
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,135
With the threat

230
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Attempted dachshund

231
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
And

232
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
A lot of people have just

233
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Crazy

234
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
Crazy what I have to endure day by day

235
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
I'm no celebrity

236
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
I'm not conditioned

237
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,311
To wake up in the morning and read a couple of DMZ

238
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
Of people telling me to go kill myself

239
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,943
People telling me that they hope I end up dead

240
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,503
And people saying they'll call the cops

241
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,575
And report me to the police and law enforcement

242
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,439
That is not the kind of life that I was prepared to live

243
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
And the internet is not happy place

244
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Today

245
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
While I was in my Discord server

246
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,191
I received I received a DM from someone

247
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
They claimed

248
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Are they said

249
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,615
That the FBI was building a case against me

250
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,479
Are they telling the truth are they kidding are they trolling doesn't really matter

251
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
I lost my ship

252
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
I lost

253
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,671
Every single piece of my s*** that I could ever lose in my life

254
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,047
I was already on Pantone panic attack I was already on panic mode for an entire month

255
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
Going after Chromecast

256
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,911
Didn't exactly help

257
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
My free

258
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
I went ahead and I burned everything to the ground

259
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
The servers gone

260
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,663
Cloudflare account is gone everything is gone GitHub and get others gone

261
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Patreon is gone

262
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,527
The PayPal that is linked to the picture on his gone

263
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
Everything is gone

264
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
Doggone song Burn to the ground

265
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
The only thing that's left is the

266
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
So basically what you're saying is

267
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
Packers rap wasn't about to do that said time for

268
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,511
PewDiePie

269
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Disappeared

270
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
Yeah basically yeah I mean I don't know how how much disappeared he is but he is he's not hacking anymore he says

271
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Greenfield Cemetery

272
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
Louis

273
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,711
Printers you was going after a Chromecast any

274
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
The Wall Street Journal

275
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
Someone dead we don't know if he did

276
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,367
To someone on behalf of

277
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
PewDiePie

278
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Hack the walls

279
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Yes

280
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,327
That's a whole other under the cia's worried about PewDiePie influence

281
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
Yeah I mean I

282
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,543
I don't know it's like it's it's a it's a B for the ages that's for sure I did Wall Street Journal staff

283
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,127
Goes back to T-Series thing also and

284
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,735
And maybe I can give his last year Thanksgiving

285
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
17 maybe that far back but

286
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,671
Wall Street Journal published an article that was critical of the pie and said that he had

287
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,231
Amplified some like anti-Semitic

288
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
Imagery is when I got and

289
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
Disney saw it and pulled there

290
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,423
Support a few pie

291
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,359
That's why the most Sinister thing we talked about the entirety

292
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:14,271
Yeah yeah I mean that's I'm not super wet read up on that side of this but

293
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:21,183
The gist of what happened with Wall Street Journal last year or year-and-a-half

294
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
Whatever it was

295
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:28,863
But yeah Disney kind of sever ties from PewDiePie and said we're not going to support the channel anymore end

296
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,983
Obviously you guys fan didn't take kindly to that and

297
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,311
If I like talk about it on streaming on his

298
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Channel and stuff

299
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
And

300
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,503
Someone hacked Wall Street Journal to do the same kind of thing as a printer hack

301
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,783
So what happened

302
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,343
Well basically Wall Street Journal site hacked with

303
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Play the pro PewDiePie Messi

304
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,487
So the hacking never stops does it first we have all the printer hacking

305
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
Turn the printer hack hacked

306
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303

So basically this article somehow I appeared on the Wall Street journal's web

318
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
I have no idea how the

319
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,439
The big props to ever pull this off

320
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,463
I mean that's hilarious

321
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
So

322
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
Keep items to have a very

323
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
Seriously committed group of people backing him up online

324
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
Yeah and

325
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
Southlake possibly

326
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
A very committed group of people

327
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:45,663
Yeah yeah definitely yeah he's got a lot of influence especially it mean

328
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,991
This is very Community has

329
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,319
Yeah people are willing to do crazyshit for him which is

330
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,367
Interesting to me

331
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,927
As far as YouTube goes he's not bad

332
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,767
Get a lot worse stuff out there

333
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
Yeah he's a

334
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,959
He's gotten into some heat before with the anti-semitic stuff we've written before about how he's he's about women on his show

335
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,543
I'm a bit problematic

336
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,199
It was maybe last year where he was doing like one of those compilations of showing like women on Skype

337
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
Stream on Twitch

338
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,831
And there was like an AI like facial recognition

339
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,391
Eye-tracking thing that he was playing with

340
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
It was supposed to track where your eyes land

341
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,791
You can probably guess where I land if you're watching these

342
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:40,191
Okay

343
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,007
And yeah he use them drugs right language

344
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,407
And then we called it out and said this is not okay this is not really how you can

345
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,991
Women on the street is a such a double standard with like

346
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
I'm using their content

347
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
For your Channel

348
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
Then also harassing them

349
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
And he wrote that article

350
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
Yeah

351
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:11,167
Take a wild guess or actually I'm going to ask you out right how was that for you

352
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,471
Dozier go

353
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,311
Wow I just harassing emails

354
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
Yeah I have a hate mail folder now

355
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
Devoted

356
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,431
Mostly because of that

357
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
Yeah I mean that's just kind of

358
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,807
Just being online

359
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
So it's definitely not

360
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
The exception to that rule but

361
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,231
Yeah after we wrote that his

362
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
Cannabis fans

363
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:40,863
Took that very seriously which they should

364
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
And

365
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Article on his phone all night

366
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
Sprinkler play

367
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
Agency like

368
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,895
What we burn everything which is totally in his right to do that

369
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
And yeah my DM's are

370
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:00,575
Full of people still mad about that article does he ever responded to what

371
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:07,231
What the backlash has been for you as a female journalist doing her job definitely not and I mean especially with

372
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
December 6th hourly I know a lot of other journalists

373
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,327
Especially

374
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,631
I'm deal with the same thing specifically from his

375
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,239
Sending messages harassment

376
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
The threads

377
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
Stuff like that so it's

378
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,639
A lot of the same stuff that hrakert Packer draft

379
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
Is getting

380
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,199
But

381
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,271
It's our job to do it and I think

382
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Yeah it's

383
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
It's amazing to see kind of that

384
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
That culture

385
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
Take a turn on someone who's in that

386
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
Culture

387
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
So Haggard

388
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Really big fan

389
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
But

390
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:47,935
That same toxicity turned around on him when he started doing

391
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
Publishing stuff and saying like

392
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Like that so

393
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,127
Yeah I mean it's obviously is symptomatic of something

394
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
Vigor

395
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,967
What does essentially mean

396
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,759
In some ways you must have had some

397
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
So now.

398
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
You know

399
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
Camaraderie with

400
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:11,487
Package arrived from knowing what that person's going through cuz you've done that you've had the same thing happen to you and

401
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,791
I'm sure you didn't I've been in similar positions

402
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
Before

403
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:22,239
Definitely I wanted things he said was he just doesn't know how people deal with this he doesn't understand how anyone can like cope with us

404
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,287
This level of harassment everyday

405
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
And I think people are very critical of

406
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,967
The media being critical of you pie.

407
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Fanbase

408
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
Look at yourself

409
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,159
This is this is what your fans are doing to people and he

410
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
Go on to the channel and says like

411
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,999
This is rad like

412
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Keep

413
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Keep doing the

414
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
The hacksmith

415
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,095
Someone hacked

416
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Printers

I'm talking about even printers are doing their part

423
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:04,479
Now I saw this on Twitter and I actually thought it was fake I didn't really take it seriously but

424
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,575
The message was basically printed and told people to

425
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,623

426
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,695

That's what I need

430
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
That's what I'm talking about

00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,399
It's important to keep me on top is so funny

432
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423

Please keep it up

434
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,495
Just don't do anything illegal okay

435
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,775
Cuz I will look bad on me

436
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
That's the only reason

437
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,103
I mean it will look bad impede

438
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,127
Whoever that

439
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,687
Does he ever has he never come out and say like

440
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
Stop harassing

441
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
Women not that I've

442
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Scene

443
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,879
He might have stood up for people something inside like

444
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
Stop harassing women are stop pressing

445
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
People online in general

446
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,583
But I haven't really seen that it's usually kind of a

447
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
Jokey way

448
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,703
He likes that there's like this Army it's like that's

449
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
That's part of the bet

450
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,591
So yeah I mean he talked about Packer draft on one of his

451
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Videos

452
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
And kind of acknowledge

453
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
Him and put his

454
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
Handle from Twitter everything on

455
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,575
His video

456
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,623
I'm wishing Amplified who he was

457
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Keep doing it

458
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
I don't do anything illegal

459
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
Which

460
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,656
Heritage

461
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,472
I was like I don't want to get in legal trouble

462
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,544
You know like haha but like it's already

463
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,104
Been done has PewDiePie ever

464
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
Responded to your comment

465
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
You've reached out I'm assuming

466
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
And there's never been a

467
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
I mean I guess the great thing is you were harassed

468
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
And

469
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Yet you

470
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:54,304
Still wrote another article about PewDiePie I mean it's part of the job it's all we got to do

471
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
Yeah I think it's important to

472
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
Bring the stuff to light when it happens

473
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:05,056
And not everyone is going to realizes what's going on in somebody's platforms unless you're in it

474
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,592
And yeah that's

475
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,664
The biggest part of our job as journalist has to be in it

476
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm so

477
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,760
Yeah I think it's really important to

478
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Disappointed

479
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Out want to have

480
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,648
Happens to point out f***** up stuff when it happens because

481
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
It happens a lot

482
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
Because of the most

483
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Popular YouTuber

489
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
