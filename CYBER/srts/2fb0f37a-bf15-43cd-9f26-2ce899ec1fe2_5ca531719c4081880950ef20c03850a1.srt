00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
Eagle one package being delivered

2
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:32,512
National Security reporter with Vice and this is cyber

3
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,912
A podcast for motherboard about hacking their voting machines are vulnerable to hackers on Friday

4
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:45,312
Packers were able to penetrate a touch-screen voting machine in less than 2 hours

5
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,576
You've heard it before disinformation campaigns Colbert plans hatch

6
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,160
Deep inside the Kremlin by dark Putin to use Astro factories

7
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:05,280
Facebook ad buying sprees ninja hackers just do Hillary's emails and embarrass the Democrats

8
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,072
I mean it kind of works

9
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,376
We say election acting

10
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,656
Need something more

11
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,448
Sling very specific

12
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,800
Today we want to talk about what real election hacking is

13
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,128
We brought in motherboard contributor and actor recording Legend

14
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,152
Kim zetter

15
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,968
Just want a piece for New York Times magazine called

16
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
The crisis of election security

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
He doesn't call out Russian hackers as a key

18
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
Spectrum

19
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Democracy

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
Instead

21
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
Something around me

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
Voting machines

23
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
Carry out

24
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
Civic duties

25
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
Benedetails

26
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
Terrifying

27
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
Tell me

28
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,312
What is election hacking exactly because a lot of people throw this term around

29
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
Yeah I hate it

30
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
Election hack

31
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
Should only be used

32
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
When you're talking about

33
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,504
Aberdeen

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,528
Cutting machine

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,832
Yeah the misinformation campaign

36
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
On Facebook

37
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
Twitter and all those

38
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
That's not election hacking

39
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,232
So throwing up a shity meme on Facebook now.

40
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Not alike

41
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
So what are these voting issue

42
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
What do they look like

43
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
What's the software

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,824
Two primary types of voting machines used in the entire country and one of them is called a directory

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
Cording electronic machine

46
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,152
And even worth the ballot itself

47
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,456
Motor boats on his digital and the boats are digit

48
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,040
The other type of machine is called an optical scan machine

49
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
And it is a shame that

50
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
The Builder

51
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,928
Mixer selections on a full-size paper ballot

52
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,280
And then scanned into an optical reader operating

53
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
System on these machines

54
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Scyther

55
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
Windows XP

56
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
Or Windows PE

57
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,472
Cuz I'm kind of software that's embedded in ATM

58
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
Okay so what about these machines

59
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,360
What makes them so susceptible to which ones we talking about specifically that you think

60
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
Are the one that we should be worrying about

61
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,296
All the machines are problematic anytime you're talking about software there's the ability to subvert it

62
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
Right

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,648
You could go after the individual machine that the voter is using

64
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
Or you go out the back in network

65
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,744
Which is probably more efficient because

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,024
Start hacking the source

67
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,584
Machine that touches all the machines and accounting

68
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
However you could

69
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
Introduce a virus that could potentially spread to other machines because many of them at least

70
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Precinct are Networks

71
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Together

72
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
Also the end of the movie

73
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,432
Action there is a memory card gets put into the machine

74
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,712
That takes

75
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,016
Steve-O totals from it and cats

76
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
Walked over or driven

77
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,416
To Central collection office work been inserted into that Central tabulator

78
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
And has there been actual

79
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
I'm sad

80
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,560
Niggling elections in the past using this kind of method like

81
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
The past one that just happened the midterms

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Weather temps or

83
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Do you have reason to believe there were

84
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
We don't know

85
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
The intelligence

86
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
Agencies will say that they've seen no signs of anyone

87
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
Trying to subvert houghtaling

88
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Equipment

89
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
But their view is limited

90
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,736
Isaac feystone signals intelligence

91
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
Human intelligence that kind of thing

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
These machines have been vulnerable since 2000 and

93
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
YouTube

94
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,512
And so it anytime in those last elections going all the way back anyone could have gotten into these systems already

95
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:21,887
Even if you was intelligent just looking for current activity and chatter

96
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,679
They're not going to see something that's already have

97
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,959
Prior to their

98
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Air monitoring at BAE Systems

99
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
These are members of Congress

100
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:35,455
They work hard to approve budget grants to sort out election cybersecurity the one for 2018 was

101
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,015
380 million box

102
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
These are

103
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,319
Child hackers

104
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
I mean contestants stay

105
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,927
Captor keyboards to prove that within minutes

106
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,511
America's election it systems are a piece of garbage

107
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
35 out of

108
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,863
39 youngsters taking part this year

109
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,191
We're able to do just that so are you saying that

110
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
That

111
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
If you're born actor

112
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Black Rock Sheraton

113
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
It is

114
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
Sara Lee or maybe

115
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
Extremely easy to

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Manipulate

117
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,431
The American

118
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Election

119
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
We have to

120
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
Go from

121
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,343
The distinction between remote access hacker

122
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,903
As opposed to someone who is physically close to machine

123
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
And

124
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,743
Your ability to alternate

125
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,791
Action increases

126
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
If you can get into one of those Central machine

127
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:30,239
Now it takes some skill you need to understand how the machines work but the machines are sold on eBay

128
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,591
Some of the software has been exposed on the internet a decade ago

129
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,687
And so it doesn't take much for you to actually get a machine and study it

130
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:44,831
Researchers who look at the Kimberly subvert them after just a couple of weeks of studying them fully

131
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
Okay

132
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
If you are Russian you're trying to

133
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,927
Manipulate this watch

134
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
What do you do

135
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
How do you do it and how do you knock

136
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Get caught by hacking

137
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,607
Other many ways I could think of to Suburban Collection

138
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,935
If I were Russian hacker I would want to go after that elects

139
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
Action management

140
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,287
So election officials will tell you over and over again

141
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:08,127
That none of the voting machines are connected to the internet and that's just not true

142
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,711
Many of these machines have embedded modems in them

143
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,991
At at the end of the Alexa

144
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,063
They dilated and transmit those totals over

145
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
The cellular network we should be centrally the internet

146
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
2D election manager

147
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
System

148
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
So that means

149
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
It's open

150
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,767
2 malicious connectivity

151
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
If you can get into that election manager

152
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
Assistant

153
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,703
And then once you're in that system then you sit there and you'd study at or whatever

154
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,519
So that you're ready and set up for the next election that comes

155
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
And that's the one that uses birth

156
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,431
So you think it's possible that something like the midterms that just happened were sort of this test

157
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Case

158
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
What is

159
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
Stimulation for

160
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
Foreign adversary to see how they could

161
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,087
Potentially

162
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
Manipulate the big one in 2020

163
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:56,767
I don't think the midterm would have been a test case like I said desus that doesn't involve more go for more than a decade

164
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,607
There's no reason to believe that actors haven't been studying these

165
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,887
Symptoms before

166
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Baby Gardens.

167
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
You know

168
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
Really looking at 2000

169
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,079
King because the Russians became obvious

170
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
About an intense to subvert election

171
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
Weihai

172
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,967
Russia as an enemy

173
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
Long before 2006

174
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,391
16 right during the whole Reagan administration against like that has always been there and the technology has always been there

175
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Stealing place

176
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,255
I am any places God during that period

177
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:33,375
Not to the extent that they are now it was really 2002 that we got most of the machine that we have today

178
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
Why did we get new machine

179
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
In mm

180
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:42,079
We got new machines because of the debacle of the presidential race in Florida in 2000

181
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,871
After that happened

182
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
Lawmakers

183
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
In the Congress and Senate

184
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:51,039
I decided that they didn't want something like that to happen ever again

185
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,903
They decided wrongly that the punch card machine were actually the problem

186
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,511
And they wanted to get rid of them so they created their bill that would give States

187
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
Billions of dollars

188
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,583
In order to upgrade

189
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
Shooties new electronic voting machine

190
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,471
And they were sold on the button machines because the vendors convince them

191
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
That's

192
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,055
Going fully electronic was the better solution

193
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Eliminate people

194
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
I'll get the people out of the way

195
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
And you would eliminate

196
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Problem

197
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
But actually they created just a different

198
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,271
So are you okay

199
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
If you wanted to do this

200
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
Strategically

201
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
If you're foreign adversary

202
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
Do Target

203
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,951
Like County swing States

204
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,535
States themselves like Florida or Ohio to

205
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
Minorly

206
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
Manipulate so that you can

207
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Get away with it

208
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,727
Everyone says because the administration of our election

209
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,031
Star voting equipment is not centralized

210
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
If you can't throw

211
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
A federal election but that's just not true

212
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
We always

213
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,175
Every presidential election

214
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,295
It always comes down to a couple of Swing States and often the even just a couple of critical swing districts

215
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,831
Any particular districts

216
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Where

217
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
Are you might also be able

218
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
Suppress the vote and cause

219
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
Photos to be dropped from the voter rolls or things like that

220
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
Then you can

221
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,815
Manipulating election

222
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
Emily sohn 2006

223
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:15,007
16 with the effort by presumably Russian State actors to get into the voter registration databases

224
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,055
If they understand that capability

225
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,615
I was going to say we know that Russia

226
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Overall net

227
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,831
Will there be an appear to be going after the voting machine

228
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
But they were going after the voter

229
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
Castration databases

230
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
And if you

231
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:38,047
Getting some and also those records or delete voters from the voter rolls

232
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,911
You can prevent voters are actually casting. So it's actually much easier

233
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
Big Lots of Voters

234
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,983
Prevent them from ever casting about

235
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
Then going after the ballast

236
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,335
The cells of trying to alter those Balance

237
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Okay so here's a thought

238
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
In some of those too close to call

239
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
Situations were still in right now like in Florida

240
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,087
It is possible that somebody manipulated some of those votes

241
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,927
It is entirely possible more possible that

242
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,743
Someone manipulated to go to registration databases

243
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,279
And suppress the vote

244
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,095
If you noticed the increasingly in counties and states

245
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
We're having more and more provisional ballots

246
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
Beasts of balance happen when a voter goes

247
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Is the pole

248
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,871
And they are told that we have you down here in the database indicating that you already voted

249
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Or

250
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,967
Does a problem with your registration we don't see you registered here

251
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:32,319
Until you have a window of opportunity after an election to determine whether or not

252
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,623
That provisional ballot Isabela.

253
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
Only get counted if both

254
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
Election officials and the voters and resolved that

255
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
If you can cause more and more voters

256
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
To vote provisional ballot

257
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
Give more more ballast that are up

258
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
And that time. After an election

259
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
Is very very tight

260
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:54,591
Again you can disenfranchised voters

261
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,127
In multiple ways

262
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
And you never actually have to alter the software

263
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Okay so when you speak to see

264
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Security researchers

265
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,063
What do they offer is the alternate what's the better sis

266
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Denise Kern voting machine

267
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Will the focus

268
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:13,791
Is not nut is not really on the system the better system the focus is on a method

269
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,655
No matter what system you put in place there's a possibility of it being subverted

270
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
The real focus should be on

271
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
Verify

272
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
Location of the result

273
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,359
And the only way to get that is through paper ballots

274
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,687
And through a mandatory manual audit

275
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
That will

276
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,295
Verify that the digital tally is

277
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
Sewn old school backup

278
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,415
Yes but you never want

279
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,975
To do that without an audit you always want to have

280
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
Some kind of manual verification

281
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
That the software is acting

282
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
Is it supposed to act it hasn't been supported

283
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
And

284
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:57,311
How long is lawmakers pass audit laws Without Really Consulting with people who actually understand statistical audit

285
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,871
It didn't really do a lot of analysis

286
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
Just trying to figure out what would be the best audit law

287
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
And the laws for

288
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Getting these machine

289
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:10,623
Or created by lawmakers who didn't understand technology and ignored the people who didn't understand technology at all of them

290
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
Those parties have ignored

291
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
The real

292
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
4 years

293
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,535
Who have tried to steer them towards systems that have integrity

294
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Do you think that sort of

295
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,351
Unwillingness

296
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,143
To change things as sort of

297
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,935
A way to benefit both

298
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Parties when something's really

299
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
They close

300
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
And really tightly

301
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
Counting.

302
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,591
Are you all sorts of different

303
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
Things to

304
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
I don't want to think that

305
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Hardee's

306
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
Are benefiting from this chaos

307
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,575
Huarache Nike

308
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
There's been a lot of

309
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,439
Attention focus on the fact that's the voting machine vendors have

310
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,743
Close ties to the Republican Party

311
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
And in many of the

312
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,863
States where there's been a resistance to

313
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,447
Instituting practices that would provide more

314
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Integrity election

315
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,311
It's been in states that are controlled by

316
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Republican

317
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
So in Georgia for example

318
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,687
There's been a lot of resistance for more than a decade

319
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
Switching to machines that have a paper trail

320
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
But

321
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
I won't go so far as to say that

322
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:15,903
The reason across-the-board we are getting more secure elections

323
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,231
Is because some political party or another is benefiting from them

324
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,559
This whole Facebook Fiasco the

325
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
Information Warfare against the US

326
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:31,519
That might be the thing we should worry less about we almost should worry more about these very hackable

327
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Voting machine

328
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
I think voters

329
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
Depression is

330
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,407
The quickest and the easiest way

331
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
Dalton election and

332
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,063
To prevent voters from voting I mean if you're looking at memes and

333
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,879
Twitter and fake news on Facebook and things like that

334
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,415
It's very

335
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,439
Obtuse

336
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,791
Result that you're looking at right you don't know if the right people are going to see it

337
00:13:54,047 --> 00:14:00,191
You don't know if you're up to changing minds or if you're just getting at people who already believe the thing that you're trying to get them to bleed

338
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
You don't really know what the insult

339
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
So I'm just going to be

340
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
If you can go out to the voter suppression.

341
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
By altering voter records

342
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,687
But registration database is preventing voters from voting

343
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
You're doing a direct info

344
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
You're hitting the election right at it

345
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
Core

346
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
Preventing photos

347
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
From casting ballots

348
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,927
Is the most effective in the most efficient way

349
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
Alternate election

350
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,535
In other words one could maybe work in the other one will

351
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Almost certainly

352
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
Yes. Only will it more certainly work

353
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:35,263
You're also creating a real distrust in a democracy because every time of voter goes to the

354
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Pool

355
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
And they're told you already cast.

356
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,639
Or you don't actually live here you moved

357
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
All those things that they know not

358
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
To be true

359
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
You're introducing doubt

360
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,551
In the Democratic process to these voters

361
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
They're going to mistrust us

362
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
Justin Moore & Moore

363
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
And so you not only

364
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
Achieved first of all preventing the voters

365
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
Casting a ballot

366
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
And preventing their votes

367
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,535
Getting counted

368
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:02,399
You're also been showing that mistrust in the entire Democratic process

369
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
