1
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
Virus

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Eagle One

3
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Package being delivered everybody's concerned with out of the end

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,232
Turn basement or whatever president called it

5
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,560
Or the scary hooded mr. robot figure messing with their Smart Home

6
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,192
Those pesky Russian hackers destroying democracy one thing the hacking scene doesn't always consider

7
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,752
Is the real world pentesting hackers

8
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,080
It's kind of OG involves social engineering

9
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:50,944
Sometimes their stories in their human skills May building individuals are not only hilarious

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,552
Expose the biggest flaw in the corporations or agencies are hard to improve

11
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
People

12
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,416
Today we're talking to someone who calls themselves Jack

13
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:04,256
Do the physical pen tester and also brags about breaking into building

14
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,328
I've been a coup in this

15
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,096
Decipher

16
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
Tell me it's

17
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,544
Jack for like dr. Jekyll and mr. Hyde Wright

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,568
Something to

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,432
Yeah that's correct it was a name given to me that's what's the beginning of my

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
FSI career

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
It was a

22
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
A friend of mine Tinker Psych

23
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
Was commenting on how

24
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,000
Adorable and sweet I appear in normal everyday life and then how vicious and scary I can be

25
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,560
You and I when I turn on my bad guy face

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,936
That is like your Jekyll and Hyde so that we can my Twitter handle

27
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,472
Okay so

28
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
Just to be clear

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,056
You call yourself a physical pain

30
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Correct

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Correct for the most part yeah

32
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
And what is a physical pain test

33
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:00,064
So a physical penetration tester is somebody who

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
Pretends to be a bad guy depending on what the organization or the company is real

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,816
Really worried about we could pretend to be burglars after physical assets inside the building

36
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Or week

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
You could pretend to be

38
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936
Hackers after technical asset

39
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
What's inside of a facility

40
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,032
And so what

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
Nitrogen testers do in general is they

42
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Actually

43
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
Bear hackers you hear about

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:32,064
The target haxton's the the Home Depot hacks in like all of those had

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
A criminal

46
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:38,208
Mind or criminal organization behind it and that's what we do is we pretend to be those Criminal

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
We actually work

48
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,024
For these

49
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,376
Company is so we're trusted insiders basically who

50
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Break in or hack into

51
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
The

52
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776
The technical side

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,384
And we try to steal all this information but in

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
Instead of

55
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,760
Turning around and selling it on the dark web or something

56
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
We

57
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
Take it all back 2

58
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,392
Their security team or The Blue Team

59
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,464
Our management and we say this is everything we got access

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,024
This is how we got access to it

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,048
And this is how

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
You can start fixing

63
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
The holes in the vulnerabilities in your

64
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
So

65
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
I might

66
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
Go in and find that these places have

67
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:25,824
Really

68
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,408
Pickable locks and no alarm system

69
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,944
And so

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
In that case I might piano

71
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
Be able to pick the lock and get into

72
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,344
Facility in the middle of the night

73
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
So I mean this is

74
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
This is really like it

75
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
Old school hack

76
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,096
Aspect back to its over this OG hack

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,936
I would prefer to think of it that way.

78
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
Okay so I am

79
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,800
Law abiding citizen you are as well

80
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Help

81
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
How

82
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,456
Did you learn

83
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,016
The skills how did you get into this

84
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,296
Because I know some physical pain

85
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,344
Shirt

86
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,672
So I I got into it and I really

87
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,744
Interesting way I was originally

88
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,351
Studying to be in journalism I worked for a radio station for a while helping to

89
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
Mapreduce

90
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
Chosen

91
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,703
Doing things like setting up

92
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,823
Energies and things like that so I got to learn to

93
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
To talk to people

94
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,663
And be able to make them

95
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,479
Comfortable and what might be an uncle

96
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,247
Situation

97
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
And

98
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,111
I also made a lot of friends during this time and

99
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,927
The hacker scene in Dallas which is where I'm from

100
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
So

101
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
Jack the Bear Brown

102
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,703
It was it was

103
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
Such a supportive

104
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
Awesome community and

105
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
Hi I would go to them for

106
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
Technical experts and subject matter experts

107
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:06,687
Stories

108
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
And

109
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
There was

110
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,551
A friend of mine who's doing Network penetration testing

111
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,879
And he got to do a physical penetration test

112
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,183
His boss asked him did you want and he was like

113
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:24,095
I don't know how to play I don't know how to lie to people I don't know the first thing about lock-picking like I'm the wrong person for this job

114
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,655
I'm freaked out by it

115
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,935
And I kind of sick joke

116
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,727
Can I do it for you at like

117
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
Lying and sneaking in the middle of the night like that movie

118
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
I'm totally down for that

119
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:41,759
And I was joking but he was like oh my God would you like I can get you on the contract that I bet you my boss with blood

120
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
What happened

121
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
And

122
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,111
I was just kind of stoned earlier

123
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,207
Okay yeah like if you think that we can make that happen then let's do it and

124
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,535
I don't know I just I I kind of naturally

125
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
Spell intuit things like

126
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,399
Things that are

127
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,495
Harder for some people and I don't know if this is something I should be proud of the things like lying

128
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
Do not do not

129
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
Very difficult

130
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,871
Are not very difficult for me

131
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,343
They coming up with an elaborate ruse and why you should trust me and I'm actually from headquarters

132
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
All of this stuff is

133
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
It kind of wears off

134
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,511
My tongue very easily and then you know aliases and all of that so

135
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,911
I don't know I think I feel like I was kind of built for it I don't have any special training or anything like that I

136
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
I have gone to

137
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,983
Training sense but

138
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,311
Starting out it was it was just

139
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Vista

140
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,967
Me and I I did pretty well at it I think

141
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
I don't think you could have done this

142
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295
Before that were

143
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
You know inside

144
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Three-letter agency

145
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Where they at

146
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,415
Absolutely all this stuff happened

147
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:56,767
I am not unique in any way shape or form like this stuff happens

148
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
All of the time and it's not always

149
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
Legal it's not always

150
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
Ani like a private

151
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,591
Basis they're absolutely folks who do what I do for the government and for other countries

152
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,735
And they do it way better than I do it's just a matter of whether they can talk about it or not and I'm going to bed

153
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,807
Do I ever run into them I do occasionally

154
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,159
And and it's always interesting to be able to

155
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,255
You know kind of share my experiences with them they can't necessarily reciprocate

156
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,535
But it's

157
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,583
It's just a neat little

158
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,143
Any little thing when you're able to

159
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
To talk to somebody about

160
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
You know what I do with

161
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
I haven't had a lot of training and for them to say like yeah you're doing great to know that I'm

162
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
I'm kind of operating on a

163
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:45,919
CIA base

164
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,271
It's kind of cool I don't know if I'd go that far but

165
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,599
But that they can take a look at what I do and say yeah

166
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
So you're sexually doing

167
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,999
Whittier High to do at times and this is my understanding of it

168
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,303
Is essential to do corporate espionage

169
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,351
But then bring this information

170
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
2 top management and say look this

171
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,423
We got

172
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
You don't have to patch

173
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,031
In a certain way and instead of it being you know a lot of code

174
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
What's your patching is the human vulnerability

175
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
It's either the human vulnerability or physical ones now and I'm the human one was the one that came really naturally to me

176
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,807
To be able to put people off their guard Beauty

177
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,831
2

178
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,855
2

179
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,791
Tell a lie or give a pretext that was good enough for them to just kind of dragon say okay that makes sense that was natural for me

180
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
The physical side of things

181
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,679
It's something that I've learned over time so now I can assess things like axes

182
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Control systems

183
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,775
And I can go to management and say

184
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:48,895
Yeah your badge tacky the readers that you're using a really old and they're really easy to hack

185
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Coffee fix

186
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,271
Your you're

187
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
This is how you can fix

188
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,135
The security of your parking lot

189
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
But that's what

190
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,743
Physical penetration testers and specialist

191
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,559
Do I do is I'm on a red tea

192
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,167
I'm on the Walmart right team and we have a

193
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,959
Group of hackers

194
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
That actually

195
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,823
Externally hack into our Network

196
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
And try to

197
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Take up things Lake

198
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,759
Personally identifiable information or credit card information

199
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
Customers

200
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
That customer databases things like that

201
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:35,487
Do the physical infiltration for them so right now I'm in means

202
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
To an end

203
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,607
So if I were an ordinary penetration tester an ordinary physical penetration

204
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
Aunt Esther

205
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,703
I would probably start off with Blake

206
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,727
Easiest thing

207
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
2

208
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
To take advantage of vide I

209
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,223
And then I kind of work my way up

210
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,271
To the D'Amore

211
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Easier ways

212
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
Of being able

213
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,415
To penetrate the building into it to see like we're

214
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
Ultimately

215
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
Statline

216
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,071
What's where like security was like wait a minute something doesn't make any sense so wide

217
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,375
Slowly get more ridiculous

218
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
With

219
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
The methods I was using to get in

220
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
And

221
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,567
That is really valuable service with all you're doing is testing

222
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
Security physical security

223
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:29,247
But my team needs me to do for them is to break into a facility

224
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,903
And gained access to Lake a and unlocks computer or password threat

225
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,207
Non sticky notes which happens all the time

226
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:43,583
And I take that access back to them they didn't use it to escalate

227
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
2

228
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,119
Stealing

229
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
Really valuable

230
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
Information that could

231
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Could possibly be

232
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
Used to damage

233
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,287
The company's bottom line or

234
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
Okay have you gotten caught

235
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
4

236
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,479
No I haven't but I've been doing this for about

237
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:05,599
Three and a half years now

238
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,671
And I say that in the lease

239
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
Arrogant way I possibly can

240
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Because it's

241
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Chester whites

242
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Sprint problem

243
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,399
And you can talk to almost any physical penetration tester

244
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,983
And they will tell you the same thing that it takes a lot

245
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,007
It is almost

246
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
You almost have to try to get caught right now

247
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
It's a matter of

248
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,943
Your people not wanting to be rude

249
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
It's a matter of

250
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,807
People just wanting to go about their day-to-day lives a lot of pee

251
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
People are not

252
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
Necessarily invested

253
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
In the well-being of the

254
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,671
The company

255
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,255
And so even if they do see something suspicious if it's not something

256
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,095
That causes them to feel unsafe they might ignore it

257
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
It's very common problem

258
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,679
And I've been

259
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
I feel like I've been close

260
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,007
Stew being caught a couple of times

261
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
Like right on the edge

262
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,895
Like oh crap this is it this is when I get caught

263
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
This is the day and it and it hasn't happened yet

264
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Self

265
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,319
I'm I'm really looking forward to the day I get to tell that story like

266
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,855
Bravo slow clap

267
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
You guys finally caught me good job

268
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
What's the first thing you do

269
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
Before you go to a job do you try to figure out

270
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Movie

271
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Employees are

272
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
And you going to social media

273
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Cuz as a journalist

274
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
That's probably what I do

275
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Absolutely

276
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
So as soon as I know

277
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
What

278
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
Kind of

279
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
Jobs I'm in for

280
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,591
Soon as I have

281
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:35,711
Like a Target or an address I will immediately first thing I do is go to

282
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Google Earth

283
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:42,111
I want to look at the building from a bird's-eye view I want to look at clothes

284
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
Up as I can on street view

285
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
I want to know

286
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
What the parking situation

287
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
Looks like I want to know what the

288
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
Entrances and exits look like

289
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,143
As much as I can gather off of that and then

290
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,679
Yes the very nice

291
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Next thing I do

292
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
Is I start

293
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,031
Scouring social media and I spend

294
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Hours

295
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:05,151
Looking through employee social media pages and I mean it I probably spend

296
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Probably like 40 hours

297
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,503
Peace on each Target looking through

298
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,903
Information on Instagram Facebook Twitter I want to see every

299
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,791
Picture that is ever been posted from this site and so I'll look up current employees past employees

300
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,351
I want to know kind of what the

301
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
The office culture is like

302
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,983
I want to know what the badges look like it's a big one

303
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
I want to know what the badges look like

304
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
Before I get on site if I absolutely can

305
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
I typically don't have a ton of time

306
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Actually

307
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,247
In the vicinity of these

308
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
Target site

309
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,855
So I will have may be anywhere between

310
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
4

311
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
214 days

312
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,695
If I'm lucky

313
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
Time

314
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
It's a matter of

315
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:58,655
Money really is what it comes down to and this is pretty standard

316
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,495
You can talk to most physical penetration testers I think and they would tell you the same thing

317
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,031
Is that companies

318
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,591
I have a hard time affording

319
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
For you to not only fly out to

320
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
Wherever the site is

321
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:16,063
But also put you up in a hotel and give you per diem for food

322
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
4

323
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,159
If I'm if I'm being realistic like if I'm targeting

324
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,999
Something like a distribution center I want to spend a couple months

325
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
At the very least

326
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:30,143
Watching just sitting and watching and seeing things like when the cleaning crew comes and

327
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
You know is there an overnight shift what is the the security guard rotation looks like there's a lot

328
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
Lidopro question

329
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,175
That I need to answer in order to get a realistic idea

330
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,015
Of what I'm going to be up against when I do finally go in

331
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:49,343
But we don't have that kind of

332
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,159
Most companies don't have that kind of funding

333
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
To put up

334
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
Pastor out for

335
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
Weeks or months

336
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,351
So we'd have a much smaller window of time to work with

337
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:04,447
Are you working constantly or is it for like a contractual basis

338
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
I swear it's like

339
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
You'll get out you got a contract

340
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,543
And then you'll work literally

341
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
Play two weeks straight

342
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
And then your off

343
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,431
Back about your and you're

344
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,991
Four months ago or so I was a contractor

345
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,599
I've since been taken onto the internal Walmart team and

346
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,415
Contractor it was

347
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,719
Much longer periods of time between

348
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Assignments

349
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
So I would work for a week

350
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,863
Or two and then I'd be off for like a month and a half and then I work

351
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:37,727
For 4 days and then I have a week off and then let your wisdom. That's kind of the way

352
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
The contractor life

353
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Work

354
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
But

355
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,639
For me now it's much more heavy taste

356
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,455
I am almost constantly on the road

357
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,503
It's got its pros and cons

358
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
For sure

359
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
I love it and

360
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,647
So you spent a lot of time in Walmart

361
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:58,719
Spending a lot of time in Walmart

362
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,047
Thankfully we're all over the world and I am never ever bored

363
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
Well I'm glad that you're

364
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,143
Spending time in Walmart

365
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,935
For me

366
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,007
You're welcome I'll take the bullet for thank you

367
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,287
I appreciate it

368
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Say who you were

369
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
4 or 10

370
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,407
Can you give me an idea of

371
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,199
The types of places he worked for

372
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
So

373
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
I have

374
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
Broken into

375
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Buildings ranging from Lake

376
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Ordinary

377
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,415
Stores like

378
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,975
Storefront places where it's just

379
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
You know a couple employees who are

380
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
Dare to manage sales

381
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,447
Manufacturing facilities lots of Office Buildings

382
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
Data Center

383
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
Data centers on occasion

384
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Distribution centers

385
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
The range could

386
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
Not be much wider

387
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,967
Probably the one thing I haven't done is

388
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
State government

389
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
Type of facilities and Military

390
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Facilities

391
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:59,647
And I'm not exactly in a big hurry to make that happen

392
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,951
Different word for let's say like in our universe

393
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
Broken into an arms

394
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Look at Lockheed Martin

395
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
No

396
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
No no no no

397
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,119
Pen tattoos that go into those

398
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
Tattoo places in

399
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
They dragged out you know that you like

400
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Sweep

401
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
And they they dragged out all these

402
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Different devices

403
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Hooked up and

404
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
They broken in

405
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
In two places they should

406
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Bourbon allowed in

407
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Side of

408
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,967
Yeah absolutely about. Stye mean

409
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,503
That happens all the time

410
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
I haven't personally

411
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Done anything

412
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
About

413
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,183
Holabird but I know people who has

414
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,463
And it's

415
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
It is really interesting

416
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
It's really interesting work I know

417
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,583
You know there are people out there who

418
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,887
Beijing Airport

419
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,167
And I thought

420
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,519
I've broken into some facilities that have armed guards

421
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,591
But nothing like government contract worker

422
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
Can I get this

423
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,711
This question a lot as well in a lot of journalists do

424
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,039
Like tell me your craziest story or one of The Crazy Ones

425
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
You thought of where

426
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,343
You know either you saw it

427
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
How the hell

428
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
More

429
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Oh gosh

430
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
So

431
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:12,351
There are a couple of them

432
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
So

433
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,703
Probably the very first one was

434
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Was one of

435
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
The bastard went it was one of my first

436
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,383
I was just really nervous I had very little experience

437
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
And

438
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
I did a little bit of

439
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,039
Reconnaissance and found out that the building was

440
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,367
Just kind of it was it was really dizzy and

441
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,951
I I was like I don't think I really want to

442
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
I don't think I would want to work here

443
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,559
I cannot wait that just looks like a prison

444
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
And so

445
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
I think maybe I could

446
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:49,215
Use that so like overnight I created this

447
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,543
Website for an Architecture Firm and I had

448
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,383
I had business cards printed out with like an alias

449
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
With the spark

450
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
Architecture Firm on it

451
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
And I called in the next day

452
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
Aaron's

453
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
Bianca

454
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,903
I found this Target online

455
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:12,511
Who had just this really incredible social media presence

456
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Once and did a lot of volunteer work

457
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,095
With that

458
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,143
With like maternity

459
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,423
Services in New Moms

460
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,239
So I called her up

461
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
She worked with HR I think

462
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Calder up

463
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:31,199
When I said hey I just wanted to let you know that you know we're doing some remodeling of of our facilities and we've got

464
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
Architects coming at the

465
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,551
Is interior designer coming out from

466
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,183
CNA lower San Bernardino I can't remember

467
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,511
She's going to be coming out to us

468
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
Facility

469
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,375
If you could just like bring her in and let her look around and ask questions

470
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,959
And at that point all I wanted to do was bring my laptop in

471
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,799
Plug into their Network and running in my skin like that was the end goal

472
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,847
If I could prove that I could get on their Network

473
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,151
And have access to the machines

474
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Stop

475
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
That was the goal

476
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:07,551
And she was a little bit confused she was like but

477
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,439
What is the reason for the timing if this like normally I get

478
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
Heads up if somebody

479
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
He's coming in from out of town

480
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,583
And I was calling pretending like I was from their headquarters

481
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,887
And so I just started Lake

482
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
Breaking down a little bit

483
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
Looks like

484
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
You're right

485
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
I'm really sorry

486
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
Kind of on me

487
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
I was told to do this

488
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,615
A couple weeks ago but I've had a lot on my mind

489
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
Because

490
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
I am

491
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,503
7 months pregnant and I'm having some

492
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
Health issues

493
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
Immediately like her tone change

494
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:48,511
Turn like a little bit of Suspicion to understand cold-blooded

495
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,559
It's pretty awful but this is the

496
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Stuff that like

497
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
I I hate

498
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,959
Saying that I don't have a conscience cuz they do and I do feel bad when

499
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,007
When bad things happen to good people

500
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,543
But if I'm pretending

501
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,591
To be a bad guy ultimately

502
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,151
My goal is to tell these

503
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,735
Stories and to protect people from this happening to them

504
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:12,831
So it's it's not as bad when I look at it through that perspective

505
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,672
She just immediately started like wanting to Mother me and

506
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,256
And take care of everything so that I had this

507
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:24,608
I was like if my boss finds out I messed up on this Lake

508
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
I'm going to be in so much trouble and

509
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,240
She's like okay well don't take care of you no don't worry about it I'll take

510
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Care of everything

511
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,544
Give me the name of this

512
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,152
You know what your architect and and maybe some contact info and I'll take care of it

513
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,808
I hung up and I showed up the next day and she was in the lobby waiting for this

514
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
Interior designer

515
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
Not realizing that

516
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,184
Obviously it was the one on the phone with her body before

517
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
So where

518
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,816
This conversation and I able I was able to

519
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,400
Loser for a little while and

520
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
Plug into the network

521
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,984
And that ended up being

522
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,800
My way in was through social engineering

523
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,104
And calling ahead so let her know

524
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:13,760
Thought I was coming but I definitely leaned on that idealistic motherly care

525
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
Side of

526
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
People

527
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,136
And that's not the first time or the last time

528
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,416
But I've done that

529
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,952
I think it was

530
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,976
It was

531
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,304
Probably about a year-and-a-half ago I was working with a partner

532
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
And we were overseas we were over

533
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,912
Garcia's at the facility that I never seen

534
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,984
Foran in the country where I didn't speak the language

535
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,640
And so I called pretending to be with a charity organization that this company works with

536
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
And

537
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:46,272
I asked if I could have a meeting with them just to say thank you for all the hard work

538
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
You did

539
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:53,440
And they were absolutely obliging they let us in we were able to plants are back

540
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
Storage device

541
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,768
While we were inside the building having

542
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
This meeting with these people

543
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
I remember

544
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,656
Driving back to the hotel on the way home and

545
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
My partner

546
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:08,288
Was just really upset it was kind of his first big social engineering gig

547
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,336
He was like we ride to the

548
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,408
This poor people like we were supposed to in

549
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
They thought we were there

550
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,712
Friends wechat

551
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
Screw them over

552
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,784
He just felt really bad about it

553
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
And I said look

554
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,344
Where

555
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,880
This is what we do

556
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:26,976
Supposed to be bad guys and bad guys don't care if they hurt your feelings or ruin their day

557
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,024
Aliens they're out for money

558
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,072
And we are out to make

559
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
These people's jobs more

560
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
More secure

561
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,960
And he turns to Migos have you ever been tested for psychopathy

562
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,568
I was actually going to ask that exact question I'm not I'm not even joking

563
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
I was like

564
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
Have you gotten tested

565
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,224
That's a sociopath

566
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
I'm happy

567
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,344
Serious question

568
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,672
But no I'm kind of afraid to

569
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:03,840
No I I really don't think that's an issue like I I do have a lot of hair

570
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
These people like I

571
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,168
I don't go around

572
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:12,288
Am I pergert

573
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
No I

574
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
I never done anything like that

575
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:24,576
I do I do this because I care and it's not like I go around my personal life lyrics

576
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,928
No sew absolutely not not

577
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,208
I had

578
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,488
One individual

579
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
Fired for

580
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
The

581
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:42,752
I was able to get gain entry because he posted a picture of his uniform and badge

582
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,800
On a Facebook group

583
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,616
And this was probably my third or fourth

584
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
Test

585
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
And

586
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,200
He

587
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,528
Didn't do anything except post that picture because he was so

588
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
Proud

589
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
And like

590
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:00,928
His mother had just passed away or something and it's like I wish my mama could see me right now

591
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,952
And

592
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,976
Oh God

593
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,584
I know I know exactly exactly

594
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,984
So I was able to take the badge and and when I I did the penetration with the badge because everybody assume Bible

595
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Because I have

596
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
It looks like

597
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,544
An exact

598
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,336
That's what it was replica

599
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
And afterwards

600
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:24,480
Hold during the debrief I told them several times I was like look

601
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,272
You want your people to be

602
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,808
Be proud to work here

603
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
You want

604
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,648
What's this kind of attitude where

605
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,696
Badge of honor

606
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
For them

607
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
You just need to

608
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:40,096
Train them up better you need to make sure that they know it is absolutely against

609
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,888
Your policies

610
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,240
To post pictures of their bats like this is not an isolated incident

611
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
And

612
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,568
Unfortunately what a lot of

613
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Companies

614
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,872
Want to do is

615
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,408
Take that incident

616
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
Fire that person

617
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,760
And say okay we solved our problem

618
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,528
We are now

619
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,296
Sakura

620
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,904
The fact is that that is not the right answer

621
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
Retraining people

622
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
Not only increases their

623
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
Loyalty

624
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,352
To the company it also creates

625
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,960
Harder attack surface you're going to have a much harder time getting past people

626
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,032
School been through a test like this and retrained

627
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
And are now more aware than you will have just like scrapping your entire security force and then in

628
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:30,528
Installing a new one a brand new one that hasn't been tested

629
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Pathways

630
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,624
General 8 yes I agree

631
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
I agree with you

632
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,184
But ultimately

633
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,792
If this is the reason for this has to make her company more secure they're doing themselves

634
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
The service

635
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:47,168
And they're also being extremely disloyal to to the folks that work for them

636
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,216
If I end up being their response

637
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
Tear in the hacker

638
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
How do

639
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
Other hackers

640
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
See

641
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
I think that a lot of

642
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,456
Traditional essay traditional hackers

643
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,576
Like just strictly technical hackers kind of see what I do as witchcraft

644
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,416
But that's okay because I see a lot of what they do as just complete

645
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
Black magic as well

646
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,768
I'm not very technical

647
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,816
Penetration tester I

648
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
I haven't

649
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,120
Entire team

650
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:17,888
Of folks

651
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
To handle the back

652
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
End

653
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,544
You know as far as hacking into the network is

654
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,360
Is concern after I've gotten that physical access for them

655
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
So

656
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:29,664
I

657
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Don't

658
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
Co Lottery

659
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
Stuff that goes on over there I go in

660
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
I say okay guys I got access

661
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,112
Is 2 + unlocked

662
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
Computer

663
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,696
I planted this rubber ducky that you gave me

664
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
And

665
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,792
EBay turn that into

666
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,840
Okay now we have access

667
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,376
To all of the

668
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:53,216
All of the credit card information for every customer that's ever come through

669
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:53,984
Or

670
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
Week now.

671
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:00,128
This to all your private health information and now we know how to make everything more secure

672
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,176
Anatomies

673
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
Mind-blowing and I think

674
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,528
Jennifer Lopez

675
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,320
Folks on their end

676
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:13,440
Social engineering is just something that they don't want to get involved in as well as

677
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,024
People in light of people

678
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
Are very few who

679
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
What kind of straddle Both Worlds

680
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
And I

681
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
I just think those

682
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Those people are super

683
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,496
But I also love being able to work with

684
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
Multimix

685
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,312
It's almost like that that differ

686
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Trending now

687
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
The person who goes

688
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
Does the NSA or the person

689
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:33,664
CIA

690
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,944
Human versus Cigna

691
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,528
Yeah that's a good way of putting it

692
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,344
Well this is

693
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
I don't know who I'm speaking to now

694
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
First I thought you were nice and now I don't know

695
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
Jamie as well

And thank you so much for having me

699
00:28:56,448 --> 00:29:02,336
