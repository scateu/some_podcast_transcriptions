1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Eagle one package being delivered to the president of the United States

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
Some of his supporters journalists well we're your enemy

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
Is the enemy of the people and they are still CNN fake news MSNBC

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
That's really the enemy of the people we know the recording to reporters Without Borders for the cpj

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
Journalist being killed just seems to be going off now we that we can be ideal Intel targets for

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
Intelligence agencies and law enforcement

7
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:59,392
In other words we are under surveillance more than ever

8
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,440
Vulnerable to cyber attacks

9
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,976
Spine

10
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,280
This week marks 6 months

11
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:10,144
Best of Hrithik and outrageous murder of Jamal khashoggi by the Saudi regime

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,472
We point the Jets hat chats between him

13
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,008
Dissident

14
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,288
Health is killer

15
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
Think about that

16
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
Today we got Runa Sandvik

17
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,552
Former hacker turn senior director of information security at the New York Times to talk about the very hard

18
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
Task

19
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
How she keeps journalist

20
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,928
Safe online in 2019

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,584
I've been a coup in this is cyber

22
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,936
It's 2019

23
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,472
How do you protect

24
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:48,032
Journalist not only in the field

25
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
But

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Online

27
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
That is a big topic for 3 years now and

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
When I started

29
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
The

30
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,648
My role was to build and create

31
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,208
And lead a security program for The Newsroom

32
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
And at that point you are considering

33
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,608
Security Basics and just started the awareness of the whole Newsroom

34
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
You are considering fishing

35
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,520
You're considering travel you considering the source communication and then in addition to that

36
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Depending on

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
The desk

38
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,664
Individual the team the story The Country someone's going to

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,528
You can then add on top of that situated measures that they can take you can start looking at

40
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
Mobile phones

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Travel laptops

42
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
Are gaps and what else

43
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,184
People need assertive bailed out

44
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,792
From there what you need kind of training is needed what kind of Hardware is needed

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,632
But it's like it's not like it's a quick

46
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,216
One item is not like it's something that's

47
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
Done and complete

48
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,848
Today it is a program that is consistently involving

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,920
Building out reminding people that is there

50
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,296
Yeah I mean also your you didn't exactly start at like you know the

51
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,344
The South Boise times

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,648
You know it was like you started the New York Times

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Which is I mean

54
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
No shade at

55
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:17,632
Motherboard and the place I work at but is probably the number one target or one of the number one targets of nation

56
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
10 states of

57
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
Which doctors who want to exploit kernels because

58
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
You have some of the most important information

59
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
In the entire world

60
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,616
I would say that that goes for any immediate work

61
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,152
Really

62
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,712
I would argue with that even Vice

63
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,784
Would be susceptible to the same type of threads

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,064
Said any other media

65
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,136
I'm in the same goes for mediaworks another

66
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Yes

67
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,256
I mean to put the difference being you're getting people who are getting information

68
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
.

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,632
Say the CIA or the NSA would want information like that

70
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
But you're

71
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:56,288
Let me near Times number one Target in the sense that it's the most obvious Target for somebody's Nation

72
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,568
To get information

73
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,640
Because you know as I have spoken to lots of

74
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
People in intelligence around the world then

75
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
They always tell me I have from Ulta

76
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
What you say

77
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Journalist

78
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
You're the best targets

79
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
Your s*** security

80
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,136
And you have a lot of information we want

81
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,976
Before I came to the times I work with a lot of freelance

82
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
Reporters

83
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
And

84
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
They haven't even heard of more challenging

85
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
Position in which

86
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,655
They have the same

87
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
Type of sources in many cases and trim suggest the Insight the entitled to level that they're at or the info that they're providing

88
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:34,431
But the reporter has even less support and backing in terms of security

89
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,503
Or it support or

90
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,063
Hardware someone ensuring their laptops or after

91
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,623
Someone helping them secure their email

92
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
For example

93
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,463
Until you have this late challenge in that

94
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
Industry

95
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
Mediaspace of how do you secure

96
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:55,423
The people who are receiving the information and then interim how do you secure the sores and ensure that level of

97
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,983
Conn's is secure and to underswap

98
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
And I think there a meteor

99
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,311
Like the X Lake Vice

100
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
That have the

101
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,039
Resources to have an in-house team that can help provide that support that in-house long-term

102
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,343
Support in planning and initiatives

103
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,159
Are there a lot of music stitches don't have it

104
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
And I mean

105
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Freelance

106
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,047
Porters are often the ones even

107
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
Traditionally before

108
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Cell phones in

109
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,935
Computers in the internet what were the most vulnerable to

110
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
Tubing kidnaps to be

111
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
Being killed in some areas

112
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
Because quite often didn't have the same

113
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
Security apparatus

114
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
Supporting them

115
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,943
Yes the same challenge goes down for the jewels

116
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,759
Now you mention there was some sort of like

117
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
I mean kind of getting it on up to date

118
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,927
Maybe some out of resistance was there is there a difference between when you're trying to teach let's say

119
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
And Alder

120
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,231
Reporter

121
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,535
That hey you should download signal

122
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
And when you talk to his sword

123
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
You should only use signal

124
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
Is there a is there a run the gamut

125
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311
No I think I think it just comes down to how your teaching it

126
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,175
YouTube two parts to what you asked about the first part of how do you get someone to use

127
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
Safety signal rain

128
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
And I would say that

129
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,063
It's more about how the trainer is

130
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Catching the tool

131
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
Anything else

132
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,463
Because I can meet the keys to you that if you use this app with me

133
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,815
We have come into an encrypted comms and messages that

134
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
Auto delete after a set period of time

135
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,983
Those are not components that you care about that message is just not going to land

136
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,055
If I on the other hand say

137
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
Uses app and we have video chat emojis and you can call me for free maybe that is more of a pitch that is

138
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:51,135
So when you've been trained different types of people you need to be able to have cigarette very quickly what kind of message is going to land

139
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,231
Right okay so then how do you I mean

140
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,583
Well then how do you sell that to anybody other than the Nationals

141
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Security team

142
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,215
The important thing is that you know I've had the same conversation with you about had some friends were lawyers

143
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:10,335
And I said to them you know when you do some of your and spoiled you wasn't very big companies

144
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,431
Imogene do you ever use encrypted apps like no sew open

145
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,503
Open source might beat you know you your information is very valuable

146
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,783
Talk to a lot of people

147
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
As a people

148
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
Like no way I'm not think I'm not going to get high

149
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,951
Does it sits in the messages today

150
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,071
Do you have to start making it more specific to a used skis that day Caribbean so that if it

151
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,887
Sew-in in some cases the

152
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
Individual

153
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
May just have to

154
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:42,079
Experience that on their own before they actually start taking the steps that they should have taken a long time ago

155
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,639
But in other cases you just have to come up with

156
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,247
A use case scenario and example and anecdotes

157
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
Historical example

158
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,831
That makes that land with them

159
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
And in some cases even just saying

160
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,975
If you start using this app with your desk

161
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Kingdom dad

162
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Becomes

163
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:05,375
A normal component in your workflow and so suddenly

164
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,775
Alice and Bob also on your desk using this app to actually communicate about something that is sensitive doesn't stand out

165
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
In any way shape or form this is just

166
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,383
The app that you just have decided to use

167
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
.

168
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
So I mean

169
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,527
This is a very broad question but how important is it

170
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
For journalist

171
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
To take their online security serious

172
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:31,999
Follow up questions to that is how important is it for journalists to protect their sources

173
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Bright

174
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,119
So would you say that right now if you're a journalist near protecting

175
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Asaurus

176
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,287
Or can you sing with why would you think it's irresponsible if you're not taking some the precautions

177
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
That you would

178
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
You would suggest

179
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,455
Absolutely it mean if you're going to argue that you would go to jail for a sores

180
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,527
Why wouldn't you turn on two-factor for us

181
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Brain

182
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:02,463
You can say that you are willing to take the steps that are necessary to protect the stores if you're not doing that

183
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
Digital site

184
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Bright

185
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,095
Have you ever been involved with

186
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
Say I'll give an example

187
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
The Interceptor story

188
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,495
I got to do with reality winner winner.

189
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
You know

190
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
Some information that she gave them leaked

191
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,919
Urban asked in terms of I got this sensitive document

192
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Orbitz

193
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
Sensitive

194
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,735
Piece of information

195
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
I'm going to go out with it

196
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
To the public

197
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
I'm going to run the story

198
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,879
Is there anything in this that could

199
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,183
Reveal who this person is

200
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
Having been part of

201
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
Discussions that touch on some of the

202
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
Portions of

203
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
That example

204
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Baidu

205
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
I do feel like The Newsroom has its own

206
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,663
Policies and guidelines and standards are and how they've that the information that they

207
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,831
Get in then how to go about doing that they don't necessarily provide the actual price

208
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
Mangetout copy your photo album

209
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
The full printed out copy that

210
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,463
Let me just read a quote or the

211
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,815
Different ways in which you can verify the data that you've gone without

212
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Giving away

213
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,215
You know the in your job I can imagine that

214
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
You also try to prepare people

215
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
For adversaries

216
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
That could be trying to get there in

217
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Who are some of the adversaries

218
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
That you had to sort of prepare for

219
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,503
MPEG reporters for

220
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:36,671
I can't go into into details but I would say that it is really very easy can you can be everything from

221
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,791
Maybe at one point we know that a story is going to get

222
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Certain hateful comments on Twitter

223
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:48,447
Or we know that a reporter is going into

224
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:56,127
Country where we suspect that their devices mean be searched at the border for example or

225
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,759
We suspect that they may be using some quick question and coming back home

226
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,367
There are so many different use-cases just depends on then the reporter the beat the

227
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,439
So they're working on Country they're going to

228
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
So what do you do to you

229
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
Because I've been to I've been to a few

230
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Contact Iberia

231
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,423
I take my own precautions when you're going to say somewhere like let's

232
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
Say Afghanistan or

233
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
Eastern Ukraine

234
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
What would you tell the reporter to bring their

235
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
Cell phone with them

236
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
Or would you get a burner things like that

237
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
If you can get specific

238
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
What I do

239
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,087
For myself is I have a travel laptop and I have a travel phone

240
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:42,719
Set any point in time those devices are then clean and set up for dead trips

241
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Specifically

242
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,511
So I'll have

243
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,095
The apps that I need access to I'll have NZ

244
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
I'll have a way to get the

245
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,703
Credentials for the systems that I need access

246
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,287
Hysterical happy phone numbers that I need on the specific trip

247
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,895
So that is any at any point in time those devices are lost or stolen or seized

248
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,503
I would only be exposing information that is

249
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,575
Relevant to perhaps that trip

250
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,391
Specifically and not like anything everything I had

251
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,671
Ever done in my life

252
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,231
Write a nested sort of

253
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
I just take the precaution that if he gets

254
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:23,167
The border and they want to start searching things and did you get access to it there's nothing to search for because there's nothing on it

255
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,983
Are even just in a case of

256
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
Someone grabbing your phone

257
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,895
Are you locked up being stolen or you accidentally leave a device in a taxi

258
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,455
These things happen it doesn't have to be

259
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,295
A police checkpoint doesn't have to be in

260
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,855
Interrogation at the airport like

261
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,183
You travel and things happen so let's just like trying to make sure that

262
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,767
If something does happen whatever that looks like that

263
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
Did they lose

264
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Quote on quote

265
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,471
Is contain and you have a good sense of what that might look like so that it's not

266
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
Everything

267
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
So I know that like I mentioned earlier

268
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,407
Spies do tenant Target journalists because they're sort of these

269
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
Traditionally quite easy

270
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,319
You know easy prey because we're not we haven't traditionally been known to be very good at

271
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
Standing how to protect ourselves

272
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Digitally

273
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,951
You have a lot of data we've got a lot of data though

274
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Right

275
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,535
One thing I know that happens in

276
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
In other places in terms of

277
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
Special governments

278
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
Where do sweeps

279
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
Offices

280
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
Etc

281
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,031
Do you party responsibilities

282
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,847
Sweeping making sure that let's say the New York Times isn't bugged

283
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
Physical security

284
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
I'm falling under

285
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
It doesn't

286
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
So you're protecting a network

287
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
So it's completely information security

288
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Information security

289
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,927
We do collaborate closely with

290
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
The team that is

291
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
Responsible for physical

292
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,047
Especially around

293
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,399
I'm only threats and harassment because there was came sometimes they start as a physical

294
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,727
Component but the Escalade online or by sea

295
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,543
So we do ensure that we are

296
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
Keeping each other up-to-date and in the loop on the different things that could happen there

297
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
On them

298
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,575
Hard to answer that question cuz I would say that we

299
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,855
Probably see the same type

300
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
Stop sign any other media Touareg

301
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,719
Either Caesar could see if they went looking for

302
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
Right but I meant to say

303
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
Are you seeing

304
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Attempts at

305
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
Ida penetrating a network

306
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
Buy a phishing scheme

307
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
In order to

308
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
Gain information or you actually seeing

309
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
You know infiltration operations

310
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:43,711
Historically the time has been targeted by nation-state actors like China back in 2012

311
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,527
And we also see the lake

312
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
Whenever a common adware

313
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,159
Scam Bitcoin scam thing floating around so it's like

314
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
Whatever it is hitting

315
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,743
Other immediate words

316
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
We are likely to see as well

317
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,583
Rights of one of your reporters

318
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,935
What phase during a story that's quite sensitive and it's on say Russia

319
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,727
You might give them a

320
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
You know profiles

321
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,359
Security checklist in order to make sure you can

322
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
Security information you have in this is what you make you my

323
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,247
Expect when you publish the story Etc is that fair to say

324
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
So when you do that and in some cases

325
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
But

326
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,207
Dad model at scale would require

327
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,767
The reporters to come to us for everything that they do

328
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
So instead the approach

329
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,143
Tutu training is like you you established like a

330
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:42,079
This awareness Baseline in The Newsroom and on top of that you can start doing more specific training

331
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,639
West jefryn desks weather that is the

332
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,199
Investigations to ask some of the foreign bureaus

333
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,783
I'm some reporter said you know right about certain hot topics

334
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
Help them

335
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,159
See what to look for with your ex

336
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
How to deal with it

337
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:03,583
What did might look like on the screen what am I look like on like in their inbox on their phone

338
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,423
Things like that that is knowledge that would be very specific and helpful to them that

339
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,519
Certain desks is not going to benefit from then for example

340
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,871
Right so it's like you almost you have sort of a Baseline tradecraft

341
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,991
Security training set up like the farm for the New York Times

342
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
So you have the

343
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,135
The onboarding training that you get when you join the company

344
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,695
And that is like a security awareness

345
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,255
I would say Basics it's like that

346
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,351
Something to get you started and then from there we do have additional

347
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:41,727
What I would say would fit into the basics package and then more targets

348
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,031
Specific guidelines on on top of that

349
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:51,967
The New York Times was there always someone like you there or was this something that was a concerted

350
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Referred by the X

351
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
How to say look this is becoming

352
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,087
A much more complex issue

353
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
And we need to hire somebody

354
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,415
To teach a reporters how to do

355
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,559
Back in 2001 as a 2014

356
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,863
At that point I had done work

357
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,143
Or the Tor project

358
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,959
Katrina water reporters I had done a lot of

359
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,799
Independent work with media Works mostly means

360
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:20,127
Scandinavian but also a couple in the US

361
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,967
Answer to work at the intersection of media in

362
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:26,271
Security for for a long time

363
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:31,647
And I think I'm meeting with it then say so at the times you were just talking about

364
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,719
Like they're doing what they're up to what I'm up to

365
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,279
He was talking about the challenges said

366
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,911
They were having an especially the certain needs of The Newsroom and it's just a very different field

367
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,471
And so I suggested that

368
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:49,823
That's exactly what I do so I would love to come and do that for the X full time

369
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,359
7 mm

370
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,895
16 was when they were able

371
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
How to create the role in Avatar

372
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,039
And I mean your advice we have a weave similar position

373
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,855
Anthony has a journalist it's been like one of the most

374
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,903
Helpful things

375
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:06,463
Even if sometimes

376
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,255
It seems like I already know this

377
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,047
Even just having someone

378
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
Taking a look for you

379
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
Example running

380
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
I had

381
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,751
Experiences with a run a background check on you as Security check to see where you're vulnerable

382
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
When you do things like that

383
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
What's been the response

384
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,895
Yeah last summer

385
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,015
Kristen and Nina on our team launched a dachshund Workshop

386
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
Initially with a doxxing cert service Ware

387
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
And if you gave us

388
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
Permission in writing

389
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:44,607
We would spend about an hour doxxing you and then telling you everything that we found and then teach you how to either

390
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
Lockdown the data or

391
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Delete it

392
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:53,311
And then we don't turn that into a workshop so now we teach you how to dox yourself

393
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
And then

394
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
Which steps to take

395
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,223
And some guy has been really really helpful both for

396
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:05,343
Are working to connect with The Newsroom but ultimate for The Newsroom to start learning what kind of stops what to look

397
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
4

398
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,719
And also help their family members and their friends to the same thing

399
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
That sounds horrible

400
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,095
Doxxing yourself

401
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,143
I think I would destroy myself

402
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,983
I think between dad and lock-picking that we did last year I think a lot of

403
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,847
Criminal attorneys Canada

404
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,711
So clearly doesn't know what they're doing do you have to take some really basic steps

405
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
To take them to like

406
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,295
This is two-factor Authentication

407
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,367
Yeah so I would say like

408
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,695
We would start with passwords

409
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
Two-factor

410
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,607
And then sir to see how the conversation goes looking for

411
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,423
Some people that is a really really good start

412
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
I think other people are

413
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:01,151
Already up to speed on those two and they're already familiar with the advanced Protection Program from Google

414
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,199
And they had to Factor on

415
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,503
Everything else and they want to talk about burner phones

416
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:06,527
Franklin

417
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,391
But you can't approach someone who's not familiar with your doctor to talk about burner phones because

418
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
That

419
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:18,559
Workload that process service for challenges the pros and cons is just not something that's going to land with something some cases you

420
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
You have to start over

421
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,727
You are ideal which may be far higher up than where they're at and really meet them at their level to give

422
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
I'm some type of training

423
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
That's going to help them

424
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,127
Love a lot even if it's not to the level that you would like to see him be at

425
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
Right away

426
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,991
Have you ever had a situation when you sent a reporter somewhere

427
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,271
And you're like

428
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
Is actually like not a great area

429
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
There's not a lot you can do

430
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
Intensive whiteleg sending them links

431
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,511
Country oar

432
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,607
Let's ru7 country and the surveillance is so serious

433
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
That

434
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
You

435
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
It's

436
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,471
You're like you got to be extremely this is

437
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Next level

438
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
You have to maybe not use your phone at all

439
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:08,991
You have an office in Moscow we do have offices in mainland China we have offices in

440
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
Hong Kong rain

441
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
People's travel

442
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
All around the world

443
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,696
How do you how do you defend your office in Moscow

444
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,536
Fry's must look a lot different than even China

445
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,632
To some extent yes and but again a lot of it is also

446
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
Early

447
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,496
Similar I think again we are teaching

448
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,544
Then face level

449
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,152
Plus the specifics on top of the van and then depending on the individual

450
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:41,504
What to look for in addition to depending on the country at the desk

451
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Beat

452
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
Whatever it is that they're up to

453
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
I think that

454
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
While we are trying to teach

455
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:52,512
I think a good example would be to talk about the mobile apps and which ones are

456
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,072
The best ones to use 460 CARICOM

457
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,424
I'm so like instead of us trying to stay up-to-date on

458
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
You know the pros and cons of all the different apps that are out there cuz there's like constantly anywhere as everyday why not

459
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
I just teach

460
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
Here's how you evaluate in it

461
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,224
Here's how you evaluate

462
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
The

463
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:18,112
Country you're going to the situation you're going to be in the meeting that you're going to have with a source

464
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,160
So that at any point in time

465
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,976
You feel like you're in a better position to

466
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:29,376
Figure that out on your own so you don't have to run back to us every time because then we're going to become the funnel in the blocker for you get

467
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Your work

468
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:34,496
Bright sunshiny enable disable of doing something

469
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:38,080
Don't think yourself I mean this is sort of how I've seen it

470
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
When I got a broader even here

471
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:40,896
That

472
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:46,784
Securing information and trying to keep people from prying into my information and knowing what I'm doing

473
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
Especially when it comes to a nation state

474
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:53,696
I literally just try to put up as many Roblox as possible

475
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,024
But I assume that at some point if they really want to get it

476
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,048
Probably

477
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Can I get it

478
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:02,656
I think the way that we talked about that in infosec

479
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,264
Community over the past couple years is like making it more expensive for the attack

480
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
In terms of

481
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:14,176
If the password for your email is password and you have no two-factor

482
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,064
It's really easy to get in at that point like they don't have to try really hard they may not even have to like fish you

483
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
To get access to the account

484
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,696
If on the other hand you have Google's Advanced Protection Program

485
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,536
Meaning you have a password you have two-factor your email does get a bit

486
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,072
More

487
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,608
Squid Sweet Annie

488
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,264
Then that's going to be a much more difficult Target for an attacker to

489
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Approach

490
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,872
Darden additional layers and you can put on top of that

491
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,944
Meaning the attacker just has to invest more time

492
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,296
More people more pools to go after you and the data that you have verses

493
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,112
Someone who doesn't have all of those features in place

494
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
And so in many cases

495
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952
I'm it's just about

496
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,560
Like you said just putting up as many roadblocks as you can

497
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,888
Knowing that if they really really really wanted to

498
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:14,336
I mean it's sad too because we can do this and we can scrutinise are apps and which apps are great and which ones aren't

499
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
But you know when you look at

500
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:18,432
The example of Jamal khashoggi

501
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,736
She thought he was communicating on WhatsApp which is

502
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,040
Route to be known as a fairly secure chat app

503
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,320
Funny enough

504
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
It was comprar

505
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,928
The device

506
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,976
The device is not the app

507
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
No

508
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
But again

509
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
You could happen

510
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,328
It could happen right

511
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,656
Yes

512
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
And I'm sorry to say that

513
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
He was contacting me

514
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:46,080
Via my cell phone the one that was hacked

515
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,408
So I'm pretty sure that they were listening to

516
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Interviews

517
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,760
They were leading the conversations that we had

518
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,320
In the case of a

519
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,624
Well resource well-funded

520
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
Powerful

521
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
Attacker

522
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,024
I need the touch of attackers that Target to me

523
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Reporters

524
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
Yours probably

525
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,192
I mean when you see something like that that happens

526
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:16,032
Maybe I'm giving yourself your own job reference but

527
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,592
Did the New York Times think of stuff like this is why we

528
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Investing

529
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Security

530
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
Information security

531
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,480
As a journalistic Institution

532
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,856
I would say that yes that's the part of it I mean how can you going back to

533
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:36,256
Why this is needed how can you argue that you're able to protect your sources if you're not investing

534
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,304
In the security

535
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,096
But the company needs as well

536
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:44,192
And what's been the response among reporters since it since you came on the scene

537
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:49,568
I think it's been really good I think everyone's been very positive very welcoming

538
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
A lot of

539
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,224
People have a lot of really good questions like it's it's it's clear that

540
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:02,624
They want to learn the big one the info they want to know how to take all of these different steps

541
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,928
And it's so interesting

542
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,792
Think I do not have a team that is very available in RI accessible that can

543
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:15,936
So you can give any really simple piece of advice to a freelance journalist out there

544
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
Please listen to this

545
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,032
To secure themselves what would you tell them

546
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,128
I would say ensure that your

547
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,688
Phone and laptop are up to date including apps

548
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
You something like

549
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,576
Dashlane 1password LastPass

550
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,856
For passwords

551
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
And turn onto

552
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,440
And don't get an Asus

553
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,048
One more question

554
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,608
IPhone or Android

555
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Which one

556
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
Secure

557
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,032
I strongly prefer the iPhone

558
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,128
I think apple has a really good track record

559
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Securing their phones

560
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,712
And also for

561
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Having a razor

562
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,552
Strong stands on

563
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:05,344
Privacy and

564
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Security

565
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:12,512
It's not just saying that that you couldn't get to the same point with an Android phone but I feel like this more

566
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,072
Tinkering and constellations

567
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,608
Settings and

568
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
Elizabeth Moore

569
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
With Android phone

570
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,800
I mean I agree I had an Android phone like

571
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,872
5 years ago and I remember I got a pop-up ad on it

572
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
Without it like

573
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,992
Even being unlocked I thought to myself

574
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
This might be a problem

575
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
I might be

576
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,672
Vulnerable to a hotel Wi-Fi or two

577
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,536
What are some of the threats that are faced

578
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
When it comes to the online space

579
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,400
Staying

580
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Safe

581
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
You would say that

582
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,800
Inter goes back to the challenge

583
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,384
Ensuring that everyone has that bass line

584
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Where

585
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,248
Up-to-date software and apps and passwords and

586
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
Two-factor

587
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,808
And

588
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:13,184
After Dad talking about the different roadblocks that you can put in place and ensuring that

589
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,000
Different people are able to leverage different

590
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,048
Settings to provide additional

591
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Safety

592
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Cuz I think

593
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,192
In terms of the

594
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,472
Actors

595
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,800
We are going to see everything from

596
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,896
Sophisticated actors and all the way down two more

597
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,944
Commodity adware scammers

598
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,480
And things like that

599
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,576
So it's really hard to pick anyone because it's her buns the gamut

600
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:45,184
Right but there are scenarios where I'm sure you might say to a journalist like looked

601
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,976
You going to go to this country and

602
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
Or even here

603
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
And

604
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,328
Spy agency is going to Target you

605
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,912
That could happen if their hair is wet

606
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
Batman switch

607
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Alyssa.

608
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:02,592
Like whether they're in New York or the traveling to a certain country

609
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,432
Doesn't really matter they can still be a target for

610
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:08,224
An agency in any country

611
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
An agency from another country even being here

612
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:17,952
Well thank you for coming into the offices and advice to talk about

613
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,280
Tell me a very very important and near and dear to my heart

614
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
I think it was fun

615
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,704
Thanks so much this week's episode with produced by Lorenzo franceschi.

616
