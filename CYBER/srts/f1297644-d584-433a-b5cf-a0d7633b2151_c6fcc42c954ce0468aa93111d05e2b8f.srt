1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Eagle one package being delivered so citizen lab track government

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
As you can imagine the human rights Watchdog likely pisses said governments off

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
Motherboard a pillar of cyber security reporting but there are those who wants

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
Recently private Spy Service of some kind was hired to go after citizen love but citizen lab

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
Back and oh so spectacularly I'm about to speak to John Scott Realty in Racine

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
Any researcher at citizen lab who helped entrap in a sting operation have a spy trying something

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
I've been a coup and this is cyber

8
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,144
Start this off

9
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
Can you tell me what is it

10
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,496
So citizens visit research group

11
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,312
Based at the Munk school at the University of Toronto

12
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
And

13
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,896
More than a decade be focused on trying to understand

14
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,944
The different kinds of digital thread

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
Face by

16
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,992
Civil Society

17
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
So that means

18
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
Hacking attacks against journalists

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
Or attempts to limit the freedom of speech

20
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,160
Online

21
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
And our interest

22
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
These days

23
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,256
Is heavily focused

24
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,024
On

25
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
The growth and proliferation

26
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
Tools for hacking

27
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,400
And how they get abused to Target

28
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,960
People like human rights defenders in descendants mothers

29
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,752
And how many enemies

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,032
You have

31
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,336
Well I think we also have a lot of friends

32
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:56,224
But I certainly this case you just that we've done something right and that someone doesn't like or do I

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,784
Yeah because that's the thing I mean this this story

34
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
I know there's been a lot of

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,344
Talkative Ben connect

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
Did some of the work you did

37
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
Identifying

38
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
NSO group and

39
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,976
Connection to

40
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Saudi Arabia

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
Take me to that

42
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
Chorizo

43
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
We've been working on this

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
Company for awhile first

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,008
Showed up in 2016 when off and on sore

46
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
And uae-based human rights Defender was targeted

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104
With Pegasus

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Spyware

49
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,016
Since that time we focus on trying to understand both the sort of global proliferation of this technology

50
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
So when governments are using it

51
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
And then digging

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,904
Pretty deeply the specific cases

53
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
Of abuse

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
That research took us last year

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
And some work live on a colleague bill marczak

56
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
To discover that a

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Canadian permanent resident

58
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
Named Omar abdulaziz

59
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
Wheat-based in Quebec

60
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Was targeted

61
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,008
With Pegasus spyware

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Now

63
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:56,128
Omar is well known for being a close confidant

64
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Of course

65
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
Brutally murdered

66
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
And the Saudi consulate

67
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
And assemble turkey

68
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Last year

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,832
Yeah it's connected to him

70
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,904
I which is obviously something that was extremely high-profile

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,464
And we know that Saudi intelligence

72
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
Is pretty ruthless and how they've been going after the

73
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
Two I think part of the big

74
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,704
Concern here and Surly the concern that Omar has had

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
Is that she was working very closely with

76
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,568
And we doing things that the

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Saudi government

78
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
I really didn't seem to like

79
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
End

80
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,224
You know his concern of course is that maybe some of his

81
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,016
A Communications with your mouth

82
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
Or intercepted because his phone

83
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,928
I've been hacked and that that that may have been part of the dossier compiled against GMO

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
Relate to

85
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:44,768
Meeting

86
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
What happened in Toronto

87
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
So

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,120
Discontinued

89
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,424
Research investigations after that case

90
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,008
But towards the end of last year my calling Behar

91
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,616
I received an email Arlington message and someone was trying to get in touch

92
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,408
And this person

93
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,968
Who represented himself is Gary Bowman

94
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:09,088
And said that he was a South African working from madrid-based Financial technology startup

95
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,416
I was interested in talking to my calling Behar

96
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
About

97
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
Financial Solutions for refugees

98
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:21,887
And of course Financial things are big problem for refugees just getting banking or a credit card can be really hard

99
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
And this is something

100
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,983
Which behind as well because bahari's himself

101
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,775
Katrina from the conflict

102
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
In Syria as well as being an employee

103
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
Citizen lab

104
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
So the conversation

105
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,479
Moves from LinkedIn to email

106
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,551
And pretty soon Gary is setting up an opportunity to me

107
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,855
At the Swanky Shangri-La Hotel

108
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:45,183
And Toronto at the end of last year December

109
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:51,583
And instead of being a conversation about financial Technology Solutions for refugees

110
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,399
It's kind of a conversation about Bihar

111
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
Who is Rey's parents are

112
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
What is political beliefs are

113
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Does he pray

114
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
Does he hate is real

115
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,871
And then it becomes a conversation about citizen Labs work

116
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,663
And some pretty sensitive things

117
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
Involving our work

118
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,783
What role are we playing in some lawsuits against NSO group

119
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
What else are we working on

120
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
What else

121
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
Do we know

122
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,159
And when he's not asking Matt

123
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,255
The question seemed to be trying to go to the hard to suggesting that citizens have to work

124
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:25,119
On episode group and reviews of the spyware might be motivated by

125
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:25,887
Auntie songs

126
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
Citizen lab has lots of projects

127
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,335
We work on the censorship of information we work on hiking groups around the world

128
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Handful

129
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
Different companies that make commercial spyware

130
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
But this gentleman

131
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
Was only used to be one company

132
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
ISO group

133
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,623
Which is kind of a bit of a giveaway mean it's also

134
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
White sloppy Tassimo

135
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Questions.

136
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,487
Might lead you to think a certain way about who he asked

137
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Unless you think that

138
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
District of Gary Bowman

139
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,167
Figure is trying to do is actually about four or five things

140
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,471
At the same time so he's trying to get

141
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:04,543
Bajar de maybe say something that could be used against Bihar

142
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
And he's trying to get whatever juicy can

143
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
On the citizen lab

144
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,479
Annie's been tasked with getting very specific questions

145
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Answered

146
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
And he's looking for some kind of potentially

147
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
Compromising

148
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Information on Bihar

149
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:23,487
That's a lot to do in one conversation into my mind it's a little bit of his conversational

150
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,071
Smashin crab so it's absolutely clumsy

151
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
But I think that

152
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
Observations that is probably

153
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
I got to do this a lot

154
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
And it may be the case that

155
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,543
Even if during the course of the conversation

156
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:41,919
The person who they're targeting becomes a little bit suspicious they can just evaporate when the conversation disappears

157
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Nobahar

158
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
Notices he's being

159
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Recorded de Zenon

160
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:52,927
Parmalee videos being recorded based on the way this moment character has replaced a phone on the table and pointed microphone

161
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
Business end

162
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,487
Edwards Behar

163
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:56,767
Now

164
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:01,375
As soon as that conversation was over bar called me and said look I think something really

165
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
A strange has happened here

166
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
And we can really

167
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,495
I take a look at this

168
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
So we do

169
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567
And my colleagues and I determined

170
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
Really within a few minutes

171
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
Digging into this

172
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:15,711
Gary Bowman identity it just looks like some kind of elaborate fake

173
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503
And we conclude okay

174
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
It looks like somebody is targeting us

175
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,087
Under false pretenses

176
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
Too long after that

177
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
I get in touch

178
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,231
With a Raphael satter of the Associated Press

179
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
And

180
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,815
Raphael using the Associated Press resources

181
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,143
Confirms that the address is used by

182
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
A company flametech

183
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
Don't exist in furthermore

184
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,031
Registered as a company

185
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
Anywhere

186
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,359
Moving from there

187
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,687
We get ready to do some kind of a publication

188
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,479
And then

189
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
Like

190
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
Perfectly timed moment I get an email

191
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,623
From somebody who represents himself is Michelle on bear

192
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,183
Amisha wants to talk to me about kites

193
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
About what

194
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Will sue

195
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
When I started doing doctoral work a little while ago

196
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
I was putting the Buy cameras on kites

197
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:12,287
And flying them over slums in West Africa to look at flooding I was trying to try cow

198
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,359
Urban flooding was leading to political conflict

199
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
And violence

200
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,151
In Senegal

201
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
And this is something that is

202
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
Findable

203
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,247
On the bottom of my

204
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,527
Personal web page

205
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,831
And Mr lonebear represented himself

206
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
As an investor

207
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,903
It was instead using this

208
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
Admittedly janky technology

209
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:35,839
To try to do a really big money a large-scale agriculture in the infrastructure projects

210
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
In Africa

211
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
Action point

212
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,751
The team message that I got from lombera felt a little bit like Mad Libs

213
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:46,079
With a buzz words and jargon pulled from my own website

214
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
And baidu

215
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
So as soon as I got this

216
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,407
You know I fought

217
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,479
Great room designs it looks like I'm being targeted again

218
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,783
Let's see how long we can play this one out

219
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,599
And maybe turn this into something we can reverse on these guys

220
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
And did you ever

221
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Reverses

222
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
Well boy did we ever

223
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,559
So the conversation progressed

224
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,143
From that initial email which of course I responded to immediately

225
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Sounding excited

226
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,543
2 Series of email exchanges where I portray a version of myself that I felt my

227
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
Confirm

228
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
Wanderers theory of me which is

229
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:25,247
I'm excited in GT graduate student who would just love to talk about this you know goofy kite

230
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
Methodology so

231
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:33,183
You know I'm sending this guy messages with links to papers and I'm talking about through the development of new technology in the field

232
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,511
When I'm not doing that I'm saying how exciting and relevant it is

233
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,071
Andher proposes a phone call

234
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,423
And I decide okay well I'm not going to give this guy

235
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,983
Any real information about me

236
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,335
But I am going to give him a burner number and more than that I'm going to create an elaborate pretext

237
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
Opera stabbing

238
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
New York

239
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,943
So

240
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,735
I paid a burner phone

241
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:01,087
And then create a bunch of red Post in Craigslist posts

242
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
Submit myself to

243
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,743
A bunch of 411 Directory services in just about every thing you can think of

244
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,583
Entreat the legend that I'm in New York apartment.

245
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:18,495
Which also gives me a reason to tell mr. Bear that I'm a little bit cash poor at the moment but I think you know when

246
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Would Peaches address

247
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,919
You're almost like you're all your honeypotting this guy in some ways

248
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Will

249
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,991
You know I really want him

250
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
Come to the meeting with me

251
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,343
And so the challenge there is

252
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:36,159
Try to drive me to that conversation without seeming

253
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
Treger to museum

254
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,511
But he noted to play into his

255
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Is stereotype about

256
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
What I thought but I think he thinks

257
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
I'm all about

258
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,447
He's good at making the calculation that you work

259
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
For citizen lab which

260
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
Does some very

261
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,823
Barely not cover up you deal with the cover world

262
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151
And I know you all to be very knowledgeable about that

263
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,431
Phase of intelligence

264
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
That you're being

265
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
Thinks you're completely night

266
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,647
Well he may have just thought that you know if you talk to me about kites I wouldn't connect

267
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
It's my primary employment

268
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
So you know

269
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
We get to this phone call

270
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,839
And there I am sitting waiting for the phone to ring

271
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,631
And the phone doesn't ring

272
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
WhatsApp call

273
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Nothing

274
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Doing

275
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
So I sit there heart pounding

276
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
And think to myself

277
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Shoot

278
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
He's on to me I've done something

279
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,615
I've been too eager

280
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
And it looks like this is going to work

281
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,807
Africa and it seems like

282
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
This

283
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,391
LS1 coil have to be postponed till tomorrow

284
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,183
No problem I say

285
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,023
Boy makes me nostalgic for being back in Africa when it was hard to make phone calls

286
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
So the next day there I am sitting in a hotel again

287
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
And this time lol bear does Cole

288
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,447
And right off the bat

289
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:57,823
I'm kind of taking it back because up until that point I've been having a word perfect English conversation

290
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,127
With a person on email

291
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,687
The call however begins in fluid French

292
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,783
Which is the language that I speak but I don't make a huge deal about it

293
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,111
I'm certainly it's not how most people would would reach out to me

294
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,671
Bear would like nothing more

295
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,975
Then to talk to me a little bit about kites but

296
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
Preferably without a lot of specificity

297
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,119
Which is good because I haven't thought a lot about kites in the past I hate you

298
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,959
So we should have both playing along this conversation

299
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,543
And pretty soon longberry suggesting it'll be really great

300
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,895
If we meet next week in New York because he's going to happen to be in town on business and

301
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Why don't we mix

302
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:36,223
I work with pleasure and I have a nice meal

303
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,759
Great Ice Age

304
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Let's make it happen

305
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,343
So longer than follows up

306
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,415
Suggesting a date and a Time

307
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
Introducing an alias

308
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,999
Thomas and Buckeye

309
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
Which is as fake as lombaire

310
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,607
Who's going to tell me the location once that's

311
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,935
That's my view that that's a ruse

312
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,311
In order to try to preserve a little bit of operational controls are not tell me the location until fairly late in the game

313
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
Making it hard for me to serve set a trap for them

314
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
And who knows maybe abused at location before

315
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
Whatever

316
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,527
So I'm in the meantime course communicating with the Associated Press

317
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
And I with Raphael satter

318
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,415
And Raphael and I are going to run this is a stay

319
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,023
And so are Rafael's going to bring some AP

320
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,863
Videography and a sports photography Talent sphere

321
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,167
And I'll have the conversation

322
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
And that is single from me

323
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Lisa dwan

324
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
He will show up

325
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,615
Cameras rolling and ask Miss your lumbar some pointed questions

326
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
So

327
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,687
Waiting with

328
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,711
Impede breath

329
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:44,063
For this guy to respond finally the day before very exciting

330
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,111
Is Thomas in vodka

331
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,951
Alias tells me okay the location is going to be the Clement Restaurant

332
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
At the Swanky

333
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
5-star Peninsula Hotel

334
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Great

335
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,375
Time to call Raphael and get him to get himself

336
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,447
And his people are reservation at the same Hotel

337
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
Same-restaurant

338
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
So fast forward to the day of the meeting

339
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,615
We're at Thursday of last week

340
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,431
And I'd spent the night before

341
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,991
Burning the midnight oil trying to

342
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,063
Fit a really small camera into a necktie

343
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
And I

344
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,159
I didn't know we have a lot of materials available as I start abusing like

345
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,255
Nail scissors and deconstructed hotels flipper

346
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,071
Wish I was using to kind of hold the material

347
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
It was kind of a reproduction it all felt pretty haphazard

348
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
So I arrive at the restaurant

349
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,311
And the person at the front or asks me you know

350
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,871
I got a reservation at I'm looking for this guy

351
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,175
Mr Lombard

352
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,759
Go back to the restaurant we go to the very back

353
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
And they're at a table behind a pillar

354
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Is

355
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
A gentleman who looks

356
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,951
Sort of like his picture on LinkedIn

357
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,767
And before I know he's getting up and hardly reading in French

358
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
And I can bring me to another table

359
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,887
This one with my back to the restaurant

360
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,423
Nice window good lighting

361
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
And within about four minutes

362
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Of the conversation beginning

363
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,103
Mulberry saying sort of offensive racist French things

364
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,151
And I think trying to get me to laugh along with

365
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,455
And I'm still thinking of myself

366
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,527
Gosh this guy's pretty bold right

367
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,367
You know we're barely started and he's already trying to get me to do this stuff

368
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
Well you know

369
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:30,047
He may have experienced that you know sometimes people get up and leave so he's got to try to get something in early

370
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,887
Write at least a minimum viable product

371
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
484a

372
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
Professional

373
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
Albeit

374
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
Somewhat bumbling spook

375
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:44,383
And it's for having this conversation which ranges from him talking about having cigars with the

376
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,967
I'll president of Africa to his daughter who's my age

377
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,759
On the phone call he told me

378
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
It was his son who is my age

379
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
I realize that there's a person who

380
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,255
Saturday nearby table and who's busy holding his cell phone

381
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
So I think okay

382
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,119
I think I get a sense of the layout in process that they're working here

383
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,679
Also mean while you're wearing a button camera

384
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
Well I'm wearing a couple of things

385
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:15,103
And by the way if your program needs like a lightly-used body mic with a little bit of chest hair on it

386
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,943
I've actually I

387
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
What's very you're kind of like

388
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Working

389
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
So

390
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:28,927
One of the challenges in the conversation was to trial

391
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
Play out in a way that felt natural one of course

392
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,535
You know your mind is anything else but relax

393
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,095
So sorry Focus remix conversation making sure

394
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,167
Too pure to be the person who is enthusiastic

395
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
I think as I think he thinks I am

396
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:47,871
The conversation ranges in for the first hour it's mostly in French and we're mostly talking about Africa

397
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
And kites

398
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
And this and that

399
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,503
And I get the sense that you know the guy is kind of enjoying

400
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,575
Portraying himself as a high roller who smoke cigars

401
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,415
Nice mbutu sese seko and Idi Amin and everything else that he says

402
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
WhatsApp

403
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,023
Yeah I think all these African leaders

404
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,863
Yeah it was it was definitely he was playing at Full Throttle

405
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
And then

406
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,191
In about an hour in

407
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
The conversational pivot that I've been waiting for happens

408
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
To my great pleasure

409
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Amuses to English

410
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
Which of course

411
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
It's going to be good for his transcription

412
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,711
And good for mine

413
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,527
And begins asking me questions

414
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
About NSO group

415
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,111
And make some kind of hard pivot

416
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
From some pretty

417
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,999
Intense and disturbing conversational topics like a novel about

418
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,863
And I'm Muslim and Jewish boy who grew up together in France and then

419
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
As adults they must

420
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,959
Kills his Jewish boyfriend

421
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
And by the way

422
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
Is citizen lab

423
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:53,919
And I know some investigations in Mexico that we've done

424
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,735
But there are some counterfeit features about this

425
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
Dial do I soothe the briefcase is

426
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,111
This is legit and one of them is that he's got

427
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,183
So when we got this sort of chief of no cards that he

428
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
Shifting back and forth and is he looks at me

429
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,559
Listen to the audio you'll discover that there some pauses

430
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
This is what he said shuffling his

431
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Is cards

432
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,959
You know look at him and smile and act like it's the most normal thing in the world

433
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,567
To have a dinner conversation with a person who's basically running off a teleprompter

434
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
Better at one point

435
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,455
You know he doesn't want to like hold the pen

436
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
And the note cards in his hand

437
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,831
Will eating sweet props the new cards up against the glass

438
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
And then is holding a

439
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Panacea

440
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
And

441
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,743
Normally you know you hold the pen with the

442
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Coin

443
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,279
On

444
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
The paper

445
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,911
He was holding a pen with the cap of it pointed toward me

446
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
And because the light in the angles

447
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:53,055
I could see that there was like a hole the hole in the top of that cab

448
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
He was pointing towards me my conclusion is

449
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
It's either a camera in there or microphone

450
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,175
He's trying to point at me

451
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,759
Okay so I got asked at what point do you just can

452
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Will

453
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,391
You know we've been playing along for an hour and an hour and a half

454
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
And us

455
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,487
I get this message discreetly

456
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,535
From Rafael sangheili

457
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,863
The batteries on our lavalier mics are running low

458
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
Can we speed things up

459
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
And I I would have been happy to

460
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
Finish my creme brulee

461
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
By Thomas

462
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,335
At this point you know Michelle is also ask me some questions about my mom

463
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
So I decided

464
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
It's time to wrap

465
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
This thing up

466
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
I decide to

467
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,199
Send the signal

468
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
So I send the signal Rafael

469
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,295
And then

470
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Start distracting

471
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Michelle

472
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
Raphael satter shows up

473
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
Cameron toe

474
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
And

475
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,535
How is pulling up a chair and sitting down next to me she'll

476
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,583
Just as Michelle turns and sees him

477
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
Resulting in a moment of pure surprise

478
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,935
Do this at all scare you

479
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,519
Some of the work that you do knowing that someone's going to pay

480
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
Samax Israeli

481
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,639
Intelligence official or defense official 2

482
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,943
Spy on you and to try to

483
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,223
Essentially

484
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
Destroyer

485
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Is look

486
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:13,183
We must be doing something right if somebody is paying all this money to send people

487
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
Around the world

488
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,023
To have a fancy meals with us

489
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,863
And try to get us to say things that could prejudice

490
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
Public view of our work

491
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,983
So we must be doing something right now

492
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
I'll be honest

493
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,311
With you it's very concerning

494
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,871
And this kind of behavior is

495
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
Unsettling

496
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,479
Which also does though is really highlight

497
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
To me and my colleagues

498
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
Importance

499
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,855
Continuing to pursue this work

500
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,647
And doing this as

501
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,671
Encouragement

502
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,743
To continue the work and to continue the investigation

503
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,047
Honestly I can't think of a better motivator

504
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
I've been a situation like this

505
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
And you know I

506
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
This is total in France

507
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
But you know this is hot on the heels of some

508
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Some work that you did

509
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,847
Essentially upsetting the Saudi government

510
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,383
And particularly

511
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
What you imagine is

512
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
Is the Saudi Prince that is a

513
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
The center of

514
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
Brutal murder of a journalist

515
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,416
The only moment during the conversation when I felt a bit of a chill

516
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:21,280
Was when he laughingly suggested that after lunch we should go together to a cigar bar

517
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:27,424
Yeah and I really did not want to leave that restaurant you know he came in with some people

518
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,728
I came in with some people and

519
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
Wild horses running

520
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
How to drive me

521
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,616
I don't actually think that there was any concern there

522
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,176
But as you said

523
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
Context what was going on

524
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,272
Obviously

525
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
I was going to

526
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
I mean

527
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,880
It's fair to say

528
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
This kind of establishment

529
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
What does intelligence mean

530
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,720
Engaged in it

531
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,512
As reporter as well and there's

532
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,048
There's certainly this

533
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,376
You know this overarching fear that you can have

534
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
When they're around because the other people who are

535
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Need to do

536
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
Criminal things for governor

537
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,544
So here's the question

538
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,336
Are they bumblers

539
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
Or the threat

540
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
And I don't think it's a

541
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
Either or I think it's

542
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
I think it's a bit of both

543
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,784
I think that this person

544
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:21,184
Probably have done this sort of thing a bit too much and become complacent

545
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
That said

546
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,000
I have no illusions

547
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,304
It's about the complacency of his employer is

548
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,096
Or their motivations

549
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,448
Tattoo harm to The credibility of the work that we do

550
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
Absolutely

551
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,776
I mean I guess you don't from

552
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
Another standpoint

553
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,336
If it is indeed

554
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
The people that

555
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,432
Very widely been inferred to offend

556
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Purchasers of

557
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
EServices

558
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
Came down on

559
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
It's sad that

560
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
That's happening

561
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
And that's

562
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,160
After the fact

563
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
If there was a global outcry

564
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
About

565
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,256
A brutal murder

566
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
Of a journalist

567
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
We don't know who hired

568
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:04,704
The company that hired Michel or through What You Know series of intermediaries that took place in

569
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
We really can't say

570
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,824
Quit wifesavers a company or government

571
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,592
I did it

572
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
What I will say though is that

573
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
The

574
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,480
Commercial spyware Industries 50 years

575
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,576
Responding to Reasor's like ours by saying look at the end of the day we're ethical

576
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
And

577
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
And although there may be some misuse

578
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,048
We're trying to support law enforcement they were trying to support you know the identification of terrorists

579
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
And criminals

580
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:32,864
And I think

581
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
Case like this

582
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
Really makes the point

583
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,216
Bed

584
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,752
The industry is kind of

585
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,032
Out of control

586
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:46,432
I'm capable of behaving very recklessly and ways but that don't seem to have anything to do with the law enforcement or catching turn

587
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
And a lot more to do

588
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,808
With trying to discredit a researcher is working in the public interest

589
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
Raphael satter broke

590
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
Associated Press

591
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
So please tell me from the start how did this happen

592
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,584
This one fell into my lap and I was really really lucky

593
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,400
John scott railton at citizen lab

594
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,216
Give me a ring or drop me a line and he

595
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,776
He said that hate something pretty odd is happening

596
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:17,152
He explained to me that one of his colleagues have been lured to a hotel in Toronto

597
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,712
And had been quizzed in detail

598
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
About his work on the NSO group

599
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
Israeli spyware company

600
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,368
Added after the meeting

601
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,416
The guy was so weirded out that

602
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,696
He spoke to John about it

603
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,976
And then other colors

604
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
Citizen lab

605
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,352
The whole episode and they realize that this guy

606
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
The guy that they dead

607
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,448
The researcher met at the hotel was not who he said he was

608
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
And it is company didn't look legit

609
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
And that

610
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:47,360
This look like this have been some sort of weird undercover operation

611
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,688
That's why I said well alright that sounds like a pretty cool story

612
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
Intuit

613
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
So we started

614
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,320
Everbearing details

615
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,416
Of what this individual had been saying to Citizen lab

616
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
You can have pizza Department

617
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
Damn this is not

618
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
This is not a real witch

619
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:12,192
Yeah I was pretty clear that this institution was not legit the company that this guy claimed to work for his company called

620
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
Flametech

621
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
And if you go to the website

622
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
Although it doesn't exist

623
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,336
Did go to their website

624
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
You would see

625
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:24,736
The kind of thing that you'd see on any kind of sintex start up in a bunch of gobbledygook

626
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,296
About blockchain and Bitcoin and

627
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,368
You know context defined

628
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,136
Future

629
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,160
And

630
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,720
It all seems about as non-credible as

631
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Any other

632
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Silicon Valley

633
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Weird startup

634
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,352
Except that in this case

635
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,424
It didn't really seem to be anybody working for flame sac

636
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,496
We we looked at the guys LinkedIn profile

637
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,848
And he had a kind of strange Moody black and white photographs with sunglasses

638
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
The kind of thing that you

639
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,968
That you use if you didn't want anybody doing any kind of facial recognition on you

640
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,088
And we look through the LinkedIn pages that were associated with the company

641
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,392
And John Scott Realty in spotted that

642
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,976
At least one of the guys was using a piece of clipart

643
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,024
As his LinkedIn profile

644
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,816
Our stock footage rather

645
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,376
And answer that already got John's

646
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Fishing shop

647
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:18,240
And I went to the library and I did a bit of research

648
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
And I looked up

649
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,408
Playing tag on the Spanish business registry and I realized while there is no flame tacking in Madrid or anywhere else

650
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,712
When did anywhere else in the world

651
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504
So this company wasn't registered

652
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,552
They didn't have a registered trademark

653
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:37,184
They the company Executives who claimed to live in Madrid wasn't in the Madrid phone book

654
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,280
The little by little we started to confirm John suspicion that this whole thing was

655
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,304
Except

656
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,376
I think the question you asked yourself next is

657
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,680
Who is this guy

658
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
And what is flametech

659
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
What's Baha'i

660
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,128
Batting around ideas

661
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,664
Who is behind

662
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
And of course

663
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,528
All of us were intrigued by the fact that this guy

664
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
You claim to be called

665
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
Gary Bowman

666
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,624
Add ask questions about the NSO group

667
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,672
Prove anything

668
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,720
Direction the middle of trying to

669
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,024
Puzzle our way through this

670
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,328
When John Scott Realty himself

671
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
Gottman approach

672
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
From a different company

673
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,704
This one in the Agri Tech business based out of Paris

674
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Called CPW Consulting

675
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,568
And and I was really about to

676
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:29,152
Hit the button on a story to send to my editor went when John said hold up

677
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,200
Iva now I've been contact

678
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,552
And we looked at this company CPW and once again

679
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Same pattern

680
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,600
Kind of

681
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
Vague websites

682
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
With a bunch of

683
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
Very

684
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
Big business descriptions

685
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:47,840
And when you dig into the French business registry you realize what there's nothing really there

686
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
So we think we'll all right

687
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,168
Now there's

688
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
Looks like there's a second company in the back

689
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,264
And usually gets exciting because

690
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
The guy wants

691
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
Stew meat

692
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,360
Okay so they agreed to meet again

693
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
In New York City

694
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
What are you do

695
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,736
I get very excited

696
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:10,368
Start with this is a great opportunity

697
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,416
It said that this poor guy by her.

698
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
Rosati was lured to this meeting

699
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,536
They tried to ask him leading questions about Israel they might have

700
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,584
Recorded him who knows who they are

701
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,888
But now we got a different kind of opportune

702
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
We got an opportunity to actually ask

703
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
Play to be undercover agent

704
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,264
Himself

705
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,824
Not only that but we can do this on video

706
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
So not many people know it

707
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:37,760
He probably read at the Articles rcap photos in in the American Media are the English-speaking media

708
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,832
JP actually has a has a big television service

709
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,392
And I thought what this would make

710
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,416
Great television

711
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,744
So I fly to New York on short notice

712
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,328
I joined John husa was already in the city

713
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,888
And so we agreed that because

714
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
John is a little bit concerned that

715
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,240
Somebody might be tracking them that we're not going to meet up in person

716
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,264
Add a time

717
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,848
We start working on a protocol for what we're going to do at the

718
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,640
Hotel because by now

719
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,664
This operative

720
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,552
I said why don't you come and meet me at the Peninsula Hotel at the restaurant we're going to we're going to get a very nice lunch together

721
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,112
And John makes arrangements

722
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:17,952
For a couple of uninvited guests to show up Midway through the lunch

723
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,536
So I make a reservation under an assumed name at the restaurant

724
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,096
And I bring along my AP college

725
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
Camera hidden in

726
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,424
In a duffel bag

727
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,984
And so we try and dress up all the way

728
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
Apparently didn't dress up quite well enough

729
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,408
And we sit down to dinner and as luck would have it

730
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,456
The the waiter brought us

731
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
Directly

732
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,528
To the table that was

733
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
Across

734
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,904
From where John and his undercover operatives were already seated and already deep in

735
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
The conversation

736
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
So now what we have to

737
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
To do is wait for the right man

738
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
This is the

739
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,304
Straight up spicy

740
00:29:56,864 --> 00:30:00,448
Even weird it right because as we get into the restaurant

741
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,776
I have a strange feeling about one of the guys

742
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
Who's sitting

743
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,104
What's a catty corner

744
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,920
A Jew or just over my right shoulder

745
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,968
He's sitting there alone

746
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
And

747
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:15,808
Kind of staring into his phone he's sort of scowling

748
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,344
And he's just got a

749
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,928
Pick up in front of them or maybe a coffee cup

750
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,512
And he's not ordering anything to eat anything for lunch

751
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,328
So that's a little bit strange and all he does is

752
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
His phone around sort of scallops

753
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,216
End up having nothing except the deed the cup of coffee

754
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,008
And then leaves and we make icon

755
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
Sit down

756
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,408
So I feel like that's a little bit odd and John and I have discussed this ahead of time we said

757
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,248
It probably won't be just the one operative in the restaurant

758
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,808
These guys are professional to probably have other

759
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
People around

760
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
And

761
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,904
I think I'm getting a little bit paranoid

762
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
Is that the guy

763
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,488
If is it another spy

764
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
What about the people at the bar

765
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:03,680
You know they're hanging around they don't seem to be eating anything there they seem to be glancing over in our Direction every once in awhile

766
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Do I have to

767
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,800
Keep driving keep my eyes on the menu and on my

768
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,896
Lunch partner because in Siri were there to have lunch together and

769
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Conversation

770
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:18,016
And we know that we both clock John and his

771
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:24,416
We realized we probably shouldn't look over we shouldn't stare we don't give anything away let's just have a nice meal

772
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:29,536
And that actually proves more challenging than expected cuz the 8-piece budget doesn't stretch that far

773
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,608
And the stuff at the Peninsula Hotel is really expensive

774
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,680
So we start strategizing about how we're going to

775
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
To squeeze out

776
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,752
About $70

777
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,056
To cover our meal and it's a real challenge

778
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
Okay so tell me what the confrontation

779
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
Do you actually go

780
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
You ask him

781
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:51,040
I can overhear the conversation that the Donna and each other happy

782
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,088
Half French half in English

783
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,368
And then at 1

784
00:31:54,624 --> 00:32:00,000
Point we have a photographer who's loitering around downstairs she's she's waiting for anything.

785
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
Happen to anybody

786
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Hotel

787
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,424
And she's getting a bit bored because what we are trying to enjoy about half a dozen oysters

788
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
And two glasses

789
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
What line between us

790
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:15,616
He's out in the cold waiting for waiting for something to happen nothing's happening so she texts me and she says

791
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
Is this thing really happening

792
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,992
You know maybe John realize that the guy was legit after on they're just having a good conversation

793
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,600
And that's when I can over here over the noise of the restaurant the words NSO

794
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
From the other end of the table

795
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
And that's when I think okay

796
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
Definitely confirmed

797
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
This is exactly what we think of it

798
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Highway

799
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,864
Patiently takes about 2 hours but I wait patiently for John signal

800
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
He sent me a text message

801
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
It says okay

802
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,704
Now

803
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,984
And then I

804
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,264
Send a little text message

805
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,848
Photographer downstairs saying keep your eyes peeled something's going to happen

806
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,200
And then I turned to my lunch companion that I say alright in time

807
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736
So we both get up

808
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,880
John at this point distracts Michelle by having him look at something out the window and wow look at that tax

809
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
Things that affect

810
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:04,256
And I Wander over to the guy meanwhile address

811
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
The cameraman

812
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,816
Stop the camera out turn it on

813
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
And I sit down

814
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
Right next from Papa chair

815
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,704
And I say hi Michelle it's really nice to meet you

816
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
Shaking hands and stress

817
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Concussion

818
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,800
And how does he react

819
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,384
And it's got you

820
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,432
I'm 60 Minutes got your stuff

821
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,224
He's not happy

822
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,040
He he seems to stiffen a little bit

823
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,368
He shakes my hand and then rapidly pulls away

824
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
Keystart

825
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,696
The kind of cover his face a bit

826
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:39,328
And finally when he realizes what I'm doing and what I'm asking him he says something to the effect of

827
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
I don't need to talk to

828
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,912
And I say

829
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,472
Actually said I really think you're going to want to talk

830
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:51,360
And I get out my phone and I show him a photo that my APK

831
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Comparison

832
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
Just taken

833
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
His office

834
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,712
And I say

835
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,040
We had an AP reporter who just want your office in Paris

836
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
2 minutes ago

837
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
And she took this photo

838
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,160
I saw what you did that she took a photo of his office

839
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,208
With a piece of paper in front of it saying

840
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Hi Michelle

841
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
And

842
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,328
And I say

843
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,912
Well I mean we wanted to be sure that he couldn't

844
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,472
I didn't want him to be in a position where he said

845
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,544
No you have the wrong idea I just have an office

846
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,616
Listen Paris I'm allergic person I just wanted to prove

847
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
Spike the football

848
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
To really prove Beyond

849
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
Andy Dalton

850
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,760
We had been there we called him on it

851
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,784
He doesn't exist

852
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
There's nothing he can do

853
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,368
So he sees the photo that I show up

854
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
He starts putting his stuff away

855
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,184
And he says

856
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
I know what I'm doing

857
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,024
A little bit of a cryptic remark

858
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,584
So I say we should what do you mean you know what you're doing

859
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,168
And then he starts repeating himself he says stuff to the effect of I don't

860
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,448
How to talk to you

861
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:52,800
You have permission to film here stop filming me leave me alone

862
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,616
He gets up to leave he says ciao

863
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,432
And then that's when it just gets misterbini

864
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Because

865
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,272
He tried to leave the restaurant

866
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,040
But then

867
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
The waiter

868
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,160
I did the waiter tell somewhere he realizes that he needs to pay the bill

869
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
So he have to come back to us

870
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,256
Meme of the camera still rolling

871
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,816
Right and I'm asking technician what's your real name

872
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,608
You said who do you work for

873
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,168
Michelle what do you think about the NFL group

874
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,544
And he's trying to spin around the room avoiding the camera avoiding me

875
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:29,920
Meanwhile John is also recording him because John had a GoPro on a mini took the GoPro out

876
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
Confrontation starter

877
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,040
So the guys being filmed from two different angles he's getting questions from me

878
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,832
He doesn't know where to put up self

879
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,416
And so he it's like a slow-motion Chase around the restaurant

880
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,232
As it goes around one table and then another table

881
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,280
And then eventually finally

882
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,864
He sort of breaks off and goes into a little back room

883
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
The restaurant

884
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,704
And complaints to the staff and thanks them for the bill

885
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
And at this point we figure okay

886
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,800
I think that's about all we're going to get out of this

887
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,336
I'm so fancy

888
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,640
I mean I think you put it best

889
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:07,040
At first we are describing this is like a John le carre novel and then it ends with this mr. Bean performance

890
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
Where are your kind of

891
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,624
Slow speed chasing him around and it's

892
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Just kind of

893
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,256
It was a little bit that they can

894
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,048
You know I showed somebody

895
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
The video

896
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,120
And she said oh I

897
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:25,472
Sorry for the guy and and I said well

898
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,800
Feel sorry for him he's

899
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,824
He's there on

900
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,616
On some sort of a mystery mission

901
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,432
This is part of his work and presumably this is the kind of thing that

902
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:37,760
When can I expect to happen when you do this when you go into this line of work

903
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,832
But I must say it was

904
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:44,672
It was bizarre and I did expect the confrontation to last this long

905
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:48,512
I really thought that we just be assured from the restaurant within the within a few seconds

906
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,536
Sigma camera

907
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,352
Instead we were there for a good for 5 minutes

908
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
With this

909
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:56,192
Relatively weird situation of the guy

910
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,008
Trying to hide but not really trying to hide

911
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,568
I mean while the other people the ones that we caught

912
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,848
Earlier in the restaurant

913
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,408
They are talking to their phones real fast

914
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,200
Real hardly

915
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,224
Walking up and down

916
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,992
Stairs

917
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,344
Somebody somehow seems to pay the bill without any of us noticing

918
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,416
Strange stuff is happening so it is a little bit

919
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
Kind of hi in Spanish

920
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,768
And it is a little bit low comedy all at 1

921
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,352
I mean how bad can you feel for somebody or group

922
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,680
People who have been hired probably for thousands of dollars maybe

923
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Essentially

924
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,080
Exploited human rights watchdog

925
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:39,712
Look at this right we don't we don't get paid to feel bad or not feel bad about it

926
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,504
It is what it is

927
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,600
I have to say that watching the video what it is hard not to

928
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
Feel a kind of

929
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,696
Of a pity for the guy

930
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:53,024
Or or or at least cringe a little bit

931
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,560
On the other hand

932
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,656
You know what this is this is the job and and I think that

933
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,728
John might say the same thing too I mean of course it's

934
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,264
It's outrageous

935
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
To have

936
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,336
Academics and researchers

937
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,152
Targeted in such an underhanded Way by I think

938
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,688
That's pretty unambiguous

939
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,016
But on the other hand this is the kind of work that we get into

940
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,576
And I wouldn't complain if

941
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,208
Somebody that restaurant had secretly taken footage of me and I was participating in a sting operation

942
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:25,536
So so this is what everybody signs up for

943
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,120
I mean that being said I think that there does need to be more attention to be

944
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
These kinds of things

945
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,936
I just happened on us soil

946
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,496
Right so when does wonder if

947
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,032
This is the kind of thing that

948
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,336
That needs a officials to look at

949
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:43,200
Justice is served asperges son on the kind of thing

950
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,016
Is this legal

951
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,600
I don't know the answer that question but but I'd love to somebody to look into that

952
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
I mean how do you feel

953
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,464
From the story I mean that having covered it

954
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,792
Are you a little bit nervous but now you're going to be targeted because

955
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,072
Yucca

956
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:04,192
You have to think I'm taking it you know I don't put words into your mouth but I'm looking as an onlooker

957
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
And I know that there is

958
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,288
A Saudi connection to the citizen lab

959
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,824
Report that

960
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,384
Goes into summer suspicion around who is hired

961
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
2

962
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
Spy on them

963
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,552
In varying incredible terms

964
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
Absolutely embarrassed

965
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:25,440
Eventually I mean if he's not ex-mossad he's asking

966
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,464
Intelligent likely

967
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
Me neither

968
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
Enemies

969
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Aesthetic mist

970
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,328
Penis as it was

971
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
These are enemies that I don't

972
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
Sherpas

973
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
You

974
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,240
Here in journalism you want these kinds of venom

975
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:42,080
Sprite and bananas far as this guy is concerned

976
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:48,736
I think the New York Times recently identified him as some form of former or retired Israeli security

977
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
Official

978
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:52,576
And does yeah course it's a little bit

979
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,648
I think I'd be I'd be more concerned if I were John

980
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
But

981
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,024
But nobody planted again to the story a bit more let's see where it leads

982
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,864
I'm not really intimidated so much as

983
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
Little bit excited

984
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:12,544
But I won't hide the fact that yeah it's a little bit nerve-wracking at the night after the story

985
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,616
Make sure the door was locked and

986
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,040
I'll certainly be looking around

987
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:28,416
Little bit more hard when when you know I kind of have to go to your meeting or when somebody

988
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,000
You knows me out of the blue and stay by Cairo hookah great story for you

989
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
I think I might might hesitate a little bit

990
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
Well

991
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,352
