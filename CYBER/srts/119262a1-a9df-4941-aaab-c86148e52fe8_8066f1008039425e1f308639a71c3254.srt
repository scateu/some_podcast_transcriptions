00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Package being delivered imagine

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,464
Update your computer

6
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:38,400
Well that's exactly what happened last year just thousands of people

7
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:43,264
Cybersecurity pros of The Perils of so-called supply chain attacks

8
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:48,384
Any types of attacks hackers compromise a computer's Hardware at the fact

9
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,712
War poison a software update from a manufacturer

10
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,272
Tricking victims into installing malware

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,904
Last week motherboard contributor Kim zetter revealed one of the largest and scariest

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,952
Supply chain hacks in recent memory

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
Hackers broke into the servers

14
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
Taiwanese computer maker

15
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
Asus

16
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,608
Didn't push an update

17
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,144
Thousand people

18
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,448
Kaspersky lab researchers

19
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,776
Attack around half-a-million Windows computers

20
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,056
Received the update

21
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,848
The hackers only targeted

22
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:20,640
About 600 so sister

23
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,712
It's not the first and won't be the last pack of this

24
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,480
Time

25
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,760
Can I ask you today

26
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,576
With us to talk about this Brazen supply chain attack

27
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
Attack

28
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
Have a ball

29
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
In the last few years

30
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:38,048
I've been McCoo and this is cyber

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Very important question

32
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
Aces to Aces

33
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
I don't know

34
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,056
Beautiful scenery will go with a C

35
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920
Let's talk about this cuz it's you know

36
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
A supply chain attack

37
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
By Nation

38
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
Those don't happen very often

39
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,112
No they don't

40
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,184
Just because of the nature of them

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,256
In this case you know they're tricking the software update

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,912
And to install the malware on customers laptop and they also signed it with

43
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,984
The attackers have also signed it with legitimate Asus

44
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,288
Digital certificate so it

45
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
It looks completely authentic

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
How to use a receiving it

47
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
And how many people did this

48
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
The fact

49
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,016
Well Kaspersky lab researchers were the ones who

50
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,320
Discovered this and they said that at least

51
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,392
$57,000 of their customers got infect

52
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,720
But that's only you know what they can see

53
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,584
And so you have to sort of extrapolate that to other AV companies

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,376
And other

55
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,936
Asus customers who maybe don't have

56
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
Antivirus software

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
And

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
Under that estimate

59
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,384
Kaspersky thinks that probably half a million Fest

60
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
Avesis got infected

61
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,760
I spoke with semantics in and at least 13,000 of their customer

62
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:02,784
Rolfing

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600
It's already at that point we're up to 70,000 that we know of

64
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,416
Xiomara second here

65
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
And just

66
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,000
Why do you explain to me what

67
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,048
Supply chain attack is

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Visa V Nation

69
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,608
Can States win their

70
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,728
So supply chain Attack Just refers to an attack that happens

71
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
Usually it is referring something is happening during

72
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592
Manufacturing stage

73
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
Or assembly stage

74
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,944
Or we called interdiction

75
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Whereas

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,040
Equipment is being shipped out to a customer

77
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,832
Someone like the NSA

78
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Or the

79
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
CIA or someone else

80
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Will intercept it

81
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
From FedEx

82
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
UPS

83
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,048
And then do their manipulation and then send it on its way

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,448
I'm so those are the ways that we know friends at the end of season

85
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,752
Or you can get either.

86
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
Famous Bloomberg story

87
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:00,640
About the manufacturing plant in China

88
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Or Taiwan that was

89
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,456
Inserting malicious

90
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
Does Chip supposedly

91
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Inserting a militia

92
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:07,040
Chip on the motherboard

93
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,624
So those are the ways that we traditionally think of

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
Supply chain

95
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,208
Haven't even better way is

96
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
To do with the way that

97
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
This happened with the Asus

98
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
Which is

99
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
To hijack that trusted Channel

100
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,911
For updating software on the customer

101
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Where's machine

102
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
And it's not even something where you have to actually

103
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,543
Physically plant something inside of a machine

104
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
You're actually

105
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,871
Doing advice internet

106
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
Is a lot easier in that sense

107
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
But it you know your ear

108
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,319
It's should be harder because you're trusting

109
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,647
That those manufacturers you know that they

110
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
And interactions with a lot of

111
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,535
Customers and is it supposed to be at rest a channel

112
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,375
You have this assumption that those

113
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
Vendors are protecting their Network

114
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
Better than the average net

115
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,287
Certainly you're hoping that Microsoft

116
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,383
An apple and all of those update networks are doubly so

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Secure

118
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:10,527
But this Asus example shows us that if an attacker can get into that too

119
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,087
Why shouldn't they be able to get into that too

120
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
System in the same way

121
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
That other people get in

122
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Phishing attacks

123
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
Something like that

124
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
Signing server

125
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,447
So they're on a server where Asus was signing it smell wear with it

126
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
It's legitimate digit

127
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,239
Certificate

128
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,103
And so those signing servers should be better protected

129
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,639
So Asus

130
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
A Taiwanese

131
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Computer cam

132
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:41,503
Is hacking a very

133
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
Sophisticated

134
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
Spectacular

135
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
Supply chain attack

136
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
What's the going

137
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Who

138
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
Who did it yeah

139
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,023
I have some

140
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,791
Suspicions

141
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
Yes I was probably the Chinese

142
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,655
Kaspersky has tied the attack

143
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
Potentially

144
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
Tooele group

145
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,287
Previously known as The Shadow pads

146
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
Crew

147
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
Who had attacked South Korean company

148
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
And then

149
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Supply chain attacks

150
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:13,503
And also tie them to an attack of

151
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
In 2017

152
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,831
I wish we that we know of

153
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
We know of as CCleaner

154
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
CCleaner was

155
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
Security software

156
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
Someone got into the

157
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
Supply chain are the Deliverance mechanism for

158
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
Updating. C cleaner tool

159
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,543
And those attacks are believed to be attributed to Chinese

160
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,567
Packers

161
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,175
This is what this is what was interesting

162
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,783
The researchers think that the actual

163
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Asus

164
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,599
Intrusion into its Network

165
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
Came through CCleaner

166
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,695
So CCleaner when it was infecting C

167
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
Distance also was targeting an infected a lot of systems

168
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,327
But it was also it had had targeted list

169
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,887
And on that targeted list was

170
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
At least two Asus computers

171
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,983
But as I started to Asus

172
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
Computers inside AC

173
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Asus Network

174
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
Computers

175
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,175
And so it's possible that the attackers use CCleaner initially

176
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
To get into the Asus Network

177
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
And then set up their attacks reviews

178
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Network event info

179
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Heather's

180
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,671
Not that I'm suspicious of wanting a nation-state wanting to

181
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
Have access to a wide array of

182
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Say 70000

183
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Who knows what's on the

184
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
Computers but why

185
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,375
What do you think

186
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
Happened

187
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
What were they target

188
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,495
They were targeting

189
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,871
They were infecting about half-a-million systems

190
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,407
Estimated but

191
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,247
They only appears we targeting about 600 of those in the how do we know that

192
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
Because in the malware files that Kaspersky

193
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
Collected from customers machines

194
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,903
Hard-coded into those files

195
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,463
Were 600 hashes

196
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,791
And the cracks those hashes cryptographic hashes

197
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
And those cryptographic ashes were actually

198
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,631
Unique Mac addresses

199
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
For specifics

200
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,447
Tim said they were targeting

201
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,263
And so what would happen is the malware

202
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
That came through the Asus Network you would get onto

203
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
A customer's machine

204
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,967
And it would immediately look for the MAC address on that machine the MAC address for the network

205
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,503
On that machine

206
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,319
And and they would hash you would hash that Network

207
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
That Mac address

208
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415
And if the hash on the MAC address on that

209
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
And I'm users machine

210
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,255
Match one of those Mac addresses

211
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
Hashed in the

212
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
Did hackers malware

213
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
They knew they had a targeted machine

214
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,679
And they would instruct that machine then

215
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
To reach out to the internet

216
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,263
Two website at the attacker

217
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,847
Controlled and to download a further back door onto those

218
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
600 machine

219
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
And we don't know who those 600 people were

220
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:51,967
And we don't know

221
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
Exactly how the attackers

222
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
The Mac addresses of those

223
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Machines

224
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
So you're saying is

225
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
Is this kind of a case of

226
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,719
The 70000 people were affected by this

227
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
Only targeting 600 people

228
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
It's kind of wild that

229
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
An update

230
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,143
That was for thousands of

231
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
The people

232
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,447
Add a few

233
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,287
Thousands of people were kind of caught up in this nation state hack

234
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,687
I'm using the name that the Kaspersky gave its shadow Hammer is quite apps you know there using this method hammer

235
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,527
Infecting

236
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Kaspersky says

237
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
Half a million probably

238
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Using this

239
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,159
Massive hammer

240
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
2

241
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,743
Half of my existence

242
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
When really only they wanted was

243
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,303
606

244
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
Is there any idea is to

245
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
Food OC

246
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,679
600 computers belong to

247
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
No but I mean Asus said in there

248
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
Statement there

249
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
Find me whenever

250
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823
They released

251
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
Statement said that they

252
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
Starting to contact customers and so

253
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,527
Does that mean they know who those 600 customers are

254
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:03,135
And they are contacting those people or or what it's a little unclear

255
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
So

256
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
Yeah that's a little bit of a mystery

257
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
Interesting

258
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
I mean I guess I'm thinking to myself like who uses Asus

259
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
Computers

260
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
I like I think I had one when I would like

261
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Like I was

262
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
I really

263
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Chord

264
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
University student

265
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:23,615
Targeting the Windows computers

266
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,663
They making a systems that are

267
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,735
For home

268
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,759
Security systems

269
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,807
Things like that laptop system

270
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
So

271
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,695
You know a lot of computers that considered I think the fourth or fifth largest

272
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,487
Computer maker in the world

273
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,607
There are government agencies that are probably using Asus computers

274
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
CertainTeed Corporation

275
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,447
You know it's pretty widespread

276
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Yeah I mean

277
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
Clearly if there were willing to

278
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,335
Do this attack there must have been some

279
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Some reason for it

280
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,151
Especially

281
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Given China's sort of

282
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,295
Intent on trying to hack as many people as they can in order to get

283
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
Tardis information

284
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,255
Yeah and also interesting that the command-and-control server had already been closed down

285
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,815
By the time Kaspersky discovered this in January

286
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,655
So they were pushing out the malware through the Asus server

287
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
Between June and November

288
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,031
And those 600 targeted machines then we're contacting this

289
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
Command and control server

290
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
I'm only until November so either

291
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,711
They got all the machines that they needed to get by November

292
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,295
Something caused them to shut down the program

293
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,575
November

294
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
But that's

295
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
That's awesome

296
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Sting is weather

297
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
All of those 600 computers actually got hit

298
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,975
And then got that second

299
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,255
Can a back door download

300
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,815
You're going to struck me about this is

301
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Just as similar to some of

302
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,143
Some of the Snowden

303
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,679
Leeks

304
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,031
Like you mentioned earlier interdiction how do you say you know

305
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
Intercept some of these devices and plant stuff inside of them

306
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Hacking someone's router update

307
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:06,527
That's always something I've known that the NSA is done they get ahold of his

308
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,551
System and

309
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,111
They asked you to install an update and really your

310
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
You're downloading

311
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
The payload

312
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
Is the malware that's going to be able

313
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Go to track

314
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Your device

315
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:20,095
Well that's different is there targeting you right so you let say you're in a hotel right and you're on the Wi-Fi

316
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,911
And suddenly you get this pop up saying that you have

317
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
A new update waiting for you right

318
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:31,359
So that could be someone on the hospital Network that has initiated this pop up on your machine

319
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:36,223
And it takes you if you click on it it takes you to malicious server and you get malware downloaded

320
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:41,855
So that's something targeted right but if you're talking about getting into the vendors

321
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,927
Update system that's pretty bold and brave

322
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,767
And we've only seen this the first time that we saw it

323
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
And it actually wasn't even specifically this case

324
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,167
But the first time we saw it was with the flame

325
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
Spyware tool

326
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,543
Which we believe was created by the same people some of the same people

327
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,591
Probably Israel

328
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,919
And in this case they didn't ask

329
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
Get into the Microsoft

330
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Server

331
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,527
But what they did was they tricked Microsoft

332
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
Into issuing them

333
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
A legitimate Microsoft digital

334
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,951
And then instead of

335
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,511
Subverting the Microsoft server

336
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:26,911
To deliver mail worth from Microsoft server what they did was if they were already on a network

337
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,007
They would redirect any computers on that local network

338
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
They would redirect that update tool on those

339
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Computers

340
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
2 militia server

341
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,711
But they control so anytime that up that Microsoft update tool

342
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,503
Was initiating

343
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:46,111
Transaction to reach out to the Microsoft server

344
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
To see if there are software updates

345
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
The malware on that Network would

346
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
Intercept

347
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,767
That communication

348
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,095
And redirected to a malicious server that the sauce

349
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
That the attackers control

350
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,703
And then they would get a malicious file downloaded

351
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
Extend that appeared to come

352
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
From the micro

353
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Server

354
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
So

355
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
So that's the only known case

356
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
That we have in the wild

357
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,967
Nation state

358
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
Intelligence agency

359
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
In the West

360
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,879
Using that tool and I don't believe that that was the US I believe it.

361
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
Probably is

362
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
What can

363
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,207
You know regular

364
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
Consumers do

365
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:28,351
To kind of avoid that avoided not being caught up

366
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:35,007
Not a whole lot I mean that's the nation-state attackers are good at this right they do a lot of planning

367
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,079
And they're smart about the ways that they do it

368
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,687
I'm getting a digital certificate I mean that they're taking all the boxes right there taking all the Box

369
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Because of your trust

370
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,759
It's coming from legitimate server

371
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
It's digitally signed

372
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,879
So it's funny though that there was a

373
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,463
There were some early signs about that this was malicious

374
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,047
All right about this in the story a link to a Reddit for him

375
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
Back in June 2018 where

376
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,399
Sam Aces customers

377
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,703
We're discussing this I mod

378
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,007
Alert that they were getting on their computers

379
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,567
To download this update

380
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
And they were suspicious about the f

381
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
But they said there's a

382
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
Suspicions

383
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
By the fact that

384
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
It was

385
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Digitally signed

386
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
I with a legitimate certificate

387
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
And also when they uploaded the malicious

388
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
This file to virustotal

389
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
See if any antivirus program

390
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Detected is malicious

391
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
It came out clean

392
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
So all those boxes

393
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
You know that you

394
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Utech

395
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,191
In order to check whether something is trustworthy

396
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
Passed the test

397
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,543
And with the Fallout been for AC

398
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
I mean today

399
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,895
This must not have been great there stock

400
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,015
I know it's Oasis has been in trouble before over its Security in 2016 the FDA

401
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
DC

402
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,343
File some charges and complaints against it

403
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
4

404
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,695
Embalmer abilities with iCloud updating and it

405
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:00,255
It's also a software updating tool at that time

406
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,071
Cases have been notified by customers

407
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
But they had a problem

408
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
And sat on it for a year

409
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
Before

410
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Lee addressing it

411
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,239
And then notifying effect

412
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Users

413
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,079
And so it is

414
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Tftc

415
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,455
In an agreement that it would establish

416
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Security

417
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,343
And auditing program that would that would be subject to Independent audit for 20 years

418
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
So I don't know

419
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,207
You know how that auditing is implemented but it

420
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Taylor lee Wesson

421
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Catching this

422
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,095
And so Asus responded them finally when it did come out with them

423
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Response

424
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:41,727
Said that it was releasing a patch which is ironic right because it's asking customers

425
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,775
Hey if you think you got malware on your C

426
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,103
System updated with this update your system with this new patch

427
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:50,175
This new software update that we're giving

428
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,455
And trust it

429
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
Now really trust it

430
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,063
So they've also said that they've implemented

431
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
Some extra security on their servers so that it can

432
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Can't happen again

433
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,487
But again charged previously

434
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
DC

435
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
And this happened after that

436
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
So I'm not sure that

437
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
There's a reason to believe that any

438
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
New implementations

439
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,543
To secure their Network

440
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
Can be trusted

441
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,151
As I said I think I had one in like 2010

442
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
And

443
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,735
Not even because I wed weird internet habit

444
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
But within two months that thing was like

445
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
An infection

446
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
It's like

447
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,207
Like pot I would just open it up there be pop-up well that's just you

448
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
That your

449
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
I don't know

450
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
I didn't really have much at that point

451
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
A lot of bad English literature papers

452
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,983
Do you think this is actually going to

453
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
I just make people little bit

454
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
Insecure

455
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
Quick yes to that update that pops up on there

456
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,431
Computer

457
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,503
Yes I think that I said that's a dangerous Matt Blaze

458
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,807
Professor at Georgetown

459
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,391
Has a great opinion piece in the New York Times this morning about the

460
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
Stephanie's concerned

461
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,719
That the greater risk here is

462
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,743
That people will stop

463
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
Trust the software updating tools

464
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,607
And not update their system

465
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,959
The vast majority of

466
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
Are valid updates

467
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,287
Secure update

468
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
And just because

469
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,639
In this one road case and maybe a handful of others

470
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,479
If those turn out not to be legitimate is not a reason for people

471
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,503
To just leave there's a

472
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,807
Systems wide open to attack by not

473
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
Catching them and updating them

474
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,903
And I have to agree with him on that I mean I hope

475
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Fat people

476
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:42,559
Won't completely mistrust but I think it's it for the security Community it does it's a red flag right we have to come up with

477
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
Better mechanisms for

478
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,423
Securing the distrusted Channel

479
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Two users

480
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,751
And also finding better ways

481
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
To verify

482
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,567
That these

483
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
Software updates being delivered to us are legitimate

484
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,199
I mean and also a kind of no shade to Asus but

485
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,735
To me it sort of

486
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
He pays to get a

487
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,367
A better product that's more trusted because they will be secure in their

488
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,391
Veteran

489
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
It'll be harder for

490
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,743
Go system to be hijacked by say China

491
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,351
I don't know I I'm I'm reluctant to

492
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,959
Phrase one company or or denigrate one company over in another

493
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,031
If we go back a few years I don't know if you remember Adobe

494
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,383
Many years back I don't know maybe 2009 or later

495
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,479
Attackers have gotten into their signing server as well

496
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,295
And they weren't they weren't delivering

497
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
Malware from the Adobe

498
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Server

499
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,415
But they obtained

500
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Certificate

501
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
And we're signing their malware with a

502
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Legitimate Adobe

503
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,559
Certificate

504
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,375
I think ultimately this can happen to anyone

505
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,471
Maybe

506
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:57,311
Assuming that apple and Microsoft are bar more secure we hope that they are

507
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,407
But still named companies like Adobe and others

508
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
2

509
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,223
Deliver important software

510
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
Can be struck in this way

511
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:11,135
That's a good ending play right there a little Doom and Gloom

512
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
