00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,504
Virus

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Eagle One

3
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Package being delivered imagine a world where I most critical instruments Adam

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,744
Democracy could be corrupted by hackers

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024
Voting systems

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048
On the internet

7
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Malicious actors potentially manipulate

8
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:46,848
Potentially change computers

9
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
Are voting systems use for things like the presidential elections in 2016 and 2012 and ostensibly for

10
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,808
20/20 working on the internet

11
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,344
Unhackable

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
Meanwhile we've all been focused on the information Warfare emanating out of the Kremlin and what's going to happen to know them

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
Numbers from now I first would like to mention election security this has been and will continue

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,984
You to be a top priority for the intelligence community

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,848
We assess that foreign actors will view the 2020 us elections

16
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
As an opportunity to advance their interest broke the news that

17
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Actually

18
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
Researchers found voting systems were online and these included systems in Wisconsin Michigan

19
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
In Florida all well known for being key swing States in presidential elections

20
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,376
We caught up with him to discuss her massive scoop

21
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,704
I've been a coup and this

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,544
Cyber

23
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,664
So can

24
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,712
You got a really massive scoop

25
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,272
Recently do you want to walk me through

26
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,296
What you found

27
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,344
I work with some researchers

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
Who had found for years

29
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,768
4 years of voting machine vendors and election officials

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
Have been telling the public

31
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,864
After mm

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
16 election

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,496
That voting machines and even more importantly of feedback and election manager

34
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
The program buddy machine

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
Are never connected to the internet

36
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Have never been

37
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
Or never

38
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,040
And researchers found that that's not the case we already we already knew that voting machines are

39
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,600
Motivating in transmitting boats

40
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,672
On Election night and said that modem transmission

41
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,720
Is an internet connection

42
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
And these researchers decided to try and

43
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816
See if they could find those

44
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,144
I'm systems online that are actually receiving the boats that are being transmitted

45
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,424
And I did

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,264
They found the servicer outside the firewalls Cisco firewalls

47
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
They

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
Are developed a footprint for what these machines look like on the internet behind that firewall

49
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,736
And then they did searches and they found $35

50
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
System is Aaron in 10 states

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
So in essence you found out that

52
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
Diesel

53
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
Machines are actually on the internet and

54
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,440
Acceptable

55
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
2

56
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Attack

57
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,256
Yeah I mean

58
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,304
This is kind of the Holy Grail

59
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,144
Election Integrity because the

60
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,496
People who have been trying to get attention to this issue over and over again

61
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
About the hackability of machines and everything

62
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:30,432
They're dismissed constantly because they're told over and over again while the machines aren't connects the internet's they're not hacking

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,528
And that's the Resurgence it comes to voters as well before every election

64
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,832
We keep these machines off the internet

65
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
So

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,416
Arriving to this point

67
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
Finally

68
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,536
After two decades of them saying this and getting evidence that yes indeed they are

69
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
It was

70
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,144
Really significant and also a bit of

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,704
I can't climax because it turns out

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
The Buddy machine Gunderson advertising this all along

73
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:00,896
When I start to look at contracts and the researchers found some schematics

74
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,272
That the body machine vendors had submitted with the request for proposals when they're getting contracts

75
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,624
It turns out it's right there in the Emmys contract it shows diagrams

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
Of these machines connected to the internet through a firewall

77
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
So

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,536
Remarkably no one was talking about it before

79
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,327
And then

80
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,167
You know I am remarkably while they have that in their literature

81
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,751
Literature that they're literally giving to election officials

82
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
They're also telling election officials

83
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,335
Really remark

84
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,687
Why did they lie then why did they say there's no way this is

85
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,551
Events in their mind are not lying what they're what they're saying is that it's part of the

86
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,903
I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that they had it but they don't understand the technology

87
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
Very generous

88
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
But it's allowed them to

89
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
Tell election officials that

90
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,863
If it's behind a firewall their interpretation is

91
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
It's not directly accessible

92
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
If you got that fire one friend

93
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,751
And so therefore it's not on

94
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
The Intern

95
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,639
If I had said what we have something in front of the sea

96
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,967
This time it is on the internet we have something in front of the system that protecting it

97
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,831
That's still problematic because how secure is that thing that you got in front how secure is a firewall

98
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
But it would have been more honest

99
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,135
Right

100
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,535
Instead they were saying no no these systems aren't even allowed or permitted on the internet and we would never put them on the Internet and they're not

101
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
Not on the internet

102
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
And that's

103
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
Something that's very dishonest

104
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
Representation of what what it is

105
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,007
I want to point out these vendors are the ones installing this

106
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
So they're not it's not like they're giving them to the

107
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,871
Election officials and then they don't know what they like

108
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
The doing

109
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
They install them on the inner

110
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,455
4

111
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
I mean that said election officials have

112
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
They need to make sure

113
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
It happens I mean

114
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
Look back

115
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
The 2016 election

116
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,743
I'm in a lot of things that people said were

117
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Hacking

118
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
Was really disinformation

119
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:57,631
But this is a case where you have 35 devices on the internet

120
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
Some of them in swing States

121
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,495
That that actually can be meddled with

122
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
It's sort of shift our Focus.

123
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
4 years doesn't it

124
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,615
What really happened in 2000

125
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
We don't

126
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
You know what

127
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,295
If we looked at 2016 everyone said there's no evidence that any Boats were

128
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,575
I manipulated

129
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,623
No evidence of any voting machines were hacked

130
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,719
We know that there's no way to know that because no one ever actually different examination

131
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
I'm not saying

132
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
Machine for hair

133
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
Are manipulators

134
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
But

135
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
We were told a certain scenario

136
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
In mm

137
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:37,311
We were told a certain scenario in 2017 and 18 and 19 the machines aren't connected to the internet

138
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,103
Now we understand

139
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407
But there was an entirely different scenario happen

140
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
In the summer of 2002

141
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,783
16 when Russian hackers were getting into

142
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,111
Voter registration databases and trying to get into

143
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,903
Campaign offices in NC

144
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,487
These voting machines were on the internet

145
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,279
And that changes everything now

146
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,911
I mean I completely agree with you and also just looking forward to 20/20 vision how

147
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
We just found this out

148
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
You broke this

149
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
And maybe there's more

150
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,335
Maybe some of these machines were manipulated you're right

151
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,479
I'm so not prepared either to say it happened because you just don't know if you have the evidence

152
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:20,319
Russian intelligence was behind the DNC hack

153
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:26,719
Incident is Raising questions about the security of our country's overall

154
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,743
Pectoral system

155
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,815
Voting booths are voting tallies themselves

156
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Be vulnerable

157
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
20 20 I mean

158
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,191
What's the temperature in makes me think

159
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,727
What is possible

160
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,799
The problem going forward in 2020

161
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,847
There's been no friends

162
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Examination

163
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,199
If something happened in all these years that they've been sitting there

164
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
We won't know

165
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
Because no one is looking at them

166
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,391
So it's not just taking machines off the internet now and saying okay

167
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,415
Now we're good

168
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,719
We don't know what's already on the machine

169
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
And that's the problem

170
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
And no one is looking

171
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
No one seems to

172
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Care to look

173
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,911
So we can say okay we caught the problem

174
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,959
Right machines are now

175
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,519
The researchers think I'm coming down after this

176
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:16,127
But that doesn't tell us what damage was already done if if any damage was

177
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,735
And so going into 2020 we're still in the same situation we were

178
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
10 mm

179
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
16

180
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,831
Where we really don't have a clear view of what the

181
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
What state of vulnerability we really are at

182
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Bea systems

183
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,767
You know where they remotely accessible by an attacker and could be

184
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Say

185
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,351
Remotely affected them from thousands of miles away

186
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:43,007
Potentially it really depends on whether or not what what kind of effect they had depends on what they did or what they might

187
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
I have done

188
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,847
But also what district is was so we have

189
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Different kinds of voting machines everywhere

190
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,223
And so if they got into a counties machines

191
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,759
Optical scan machine

192
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
Rebecca paper ballot write-in so

193
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,415
The problem there is that most jurisdictions don't do improper audits

194
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
Even if you have that paper back at

195
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
They don't even look at it

196
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,559
Or they do an audit but it's an insufficient audit

197
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,399
So if someone has gotten into machines

198
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,215
If someone gets into machines in 2020

199
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,079
That's why paper ballots are so important that's why audits risk limiting audit or so important

200
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,151
That's the only mechanism that we have the most

201
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
The only reasonable mechanism that we have right now cuz we don't do forensics

202
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
To know if something went wrong

203
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
You know

204
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,135
We describe their almost sounds like

205
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
If they did get high

206
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
What's wrong if they have that

207
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
Elsafe

208
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:41,375
It have to know that they got hacked and then do a review that if it didn't know they were they wouldn't even do it with that

209
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,191
Books about the problem right now with the auditing laws

210
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,263
There needs to be mandatory audit laws

211
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,871
There are some states now that have audit laws but those the audits are insufficient

212
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
Federal legislation

213
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,503
To force the states to do risk limiting audit

214
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,319
Take it out of the hands of

215
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
You know

216
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,415
Losing candidates cuz that's usually what happens when someone challenges them election

217
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,999
Take that out d politicize it

218
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,583
Make it so that it's mandatory every election has this kind of audit

219
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
I'm not the kind of thing that will

220
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,655
Catching anole

221
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,215
You don't wait for

222
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,287
A problem evidence of a problem to go look for evidence right

223
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
You just

224
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,639
You do this routinely and then if something pops up there you have

225
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,431
For further investigation

226
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,735
Do you think

227
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,831
That going forward there will be enough done by the US government to

228
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,879
Security systems come 20/20

229
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
I think the

230
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,999
We don't have enough time for 20

231
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:40,767
I mean

232
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,863
One thing was remarkable for me with the story this week

233
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,679
Set the adjust been working with election officials

234
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Mm

235
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,543
16 three years now and it's taken him some time to get up to speed and get the trust of them

236
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:59,199
But for 3 years now they've been telling us that these systems are getting better that they're doing more work that we're improving security and all that

237
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
And yet

238
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,039
The most basic sing the most basic

239
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,343
Problem that we have an election would be

240
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:09,695
A critical election system connects to the internet and they didn't catch that

241
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
So

242
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,743
No

243
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
We're not ready for 2028

244
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:19,679
Do you think we should just go to the paper ballot completely across-the-board I mean is there anything we can do

245
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,031
This is not a problem having a software review the ballot

246
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,359
The problem is is that you know if you never look at the paper

247
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,431
You can't just trust the software you have to have a backup

248
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,271
When you do banking you get a receipt from the ATM right that's your backup

249
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,671
If you could see your bank statement and it shows that you didn't put money in but you've got the receipt saying that you did that's your back

250
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,023
That's why it's so important in elections that you have that back up

251
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,583
Not that the butter takes away with it from the with them

252
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,423
From the polling place but that you have that back up and that you require

253
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
Election officials texting look at the backup

254
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:57,311
So do you think that this is probably a bigger threat than some kind of

255
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711
Rogue fake Naga this information Facebook account or group that's going out there and spreading misinformation

256
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
Listen to us

257
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
Targeting grouper

258
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
I mean

259
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,319
Voting machines themselves

260
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
It's kind of easier attack

261
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,207
Because what you're doing this information you don't know if sexually

262
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
Influencing anyone right

263
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,071
People are unpredictable

264
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
Did you really hack their mind

265
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:26,495
With a voting machine if you can do it if you can get in you know if you hacked it it's

266
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Pretty

267
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
Haircut black and white

268
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
And there

269
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,151
Years of

270
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
Years of training at hacking right so

271
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
If they put their efforts at it yes

272
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,463
Quit Suburban election easy Rising

273
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
Possibly then disinformation campaigns

274
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
I wrote the story.

275
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Panther release

276
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
Brighten picture for 2020

277
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
When is already election a lot of people are

278
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,543
Duke the country is polarized to think that the actual systems we use

279
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
AR

280
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
In trouble

281
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
I mean

282
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
There's no other store like

283
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
Underpin that more

284
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,111
I agree with you I think that it's a shame that we don't really pay attention to this in off

285
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
Election years

286
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,207
It's only when we start to get a campaign and everyone is

287
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:23,071
I'm aware again oh yeah this is election season that people take this seriously

288
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:27,679
But it doesn't really matter if matters that they are taking it serious

289
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,263
I'd like to say that I think I think God for the Russians

290
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,591
There hasn't been a lot of squabbling what we've simply said is

291
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
The facts

292
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
Which are that

293
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,711
Based on

294
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Uniform

295
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,855
Intelligence assessments the Russians were responsible for hacking

296
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
The DNC

297
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,791
I've been covering the election stuff since 2003-2004 and getting people to pay attention to it is it's it's been an effort

298
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,399
And all it took was the Russian stinging somebody registration databases

299
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
I'm also happy in the DNC

300
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,751
I'm not I'm not going to make light of any of this

301
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,871
Doing that really put this issue on the table in a way that is

302
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
Pokemon I'd say that you know

303
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
The emergence of

304
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,063
Casting journalist you're not going to get another store

305
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,903
Freak me out but Jen's that'll happen again before 20/20 hamster

306
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
Yeah it probably will

307
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:28,863
I wish it would be like this

308
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
Is

309
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Importance and its

310
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
You know it

311
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:39,103
It underpins why why I do this why I spent two decades doing this to uncover something like this

312
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,159
So we have Jason Capel here yeah I see if motherboard to talk

313
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
A little about a

314
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
The last week's Roundup of cybersecurity news

315
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
So

316
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
One story or one sorcerer that one

317
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,399
Hi like it's been amazing

318
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
And I know it's been

319
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
She's been getting tons of

320
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Respect in Cypress

321
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,311
Caroline Haskins has been doing some great

322
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
Reporting on ring

323
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Tell me about it

324
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Yeah so bring is Amazon's

325
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
Home security surveillance

326
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,503
Camera company

327
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:24,159
And over the last few months we've been reporting a bunch of stories based on public records that Caroline has foil

328
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
Read from local cities all over the country

329
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
About Rings Partnerships with

330
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Police

331
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,375
So we've learned all sorts of crazy things like

332
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,423
Police can access

333
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
Ring videos with

334
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
Without a warrant they can just like asked

335
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,031
People in

336
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
You know they can

337
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,615
Get footage from people's homes

338
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,407
Just by asking for it

339
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,759
They have been so encouraged by Amazon

340
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Ring 2

341
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
Post light

342
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,927
Crime alerts on this app called Neighbors that integrates with ring

343
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
They have also done this

344
00:15:59,487 --> 00:15:59,999
Really

345
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,279
I think crazy

346
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
Thing where at

347
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,167
They've used taxpayer money to subsidize the purchase of ring cameras

348
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
So it's like

349
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
Ring will offer $100 disc

350
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,007
Count to

351
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,335
Consumers and then the city will

352
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
Literally sell them to the consumers

353
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,919
High-end

354
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Ring pics

355
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
$50 off

356
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
Find the city of subsidizing the purchase of

357
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Private surveillance

358
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
Cameras that they are then using as a

359
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,135
Ceramics Network

360
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,231
They're also doing things like requiring that cities and police

361
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
Apartments that work with Ring 2

362
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Run

363
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,607
Through like all the press release language

364
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
Before they send it out

365
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,495
They're requiring them to literally advertise these things it's just like it's a really

366
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
Creepy and sketchy

367
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
The thing that's happened

368
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Yeti stories

369
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
They completely just made me think that Amazon is

370
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
Literally taking over

371
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
American cities it's a shadow economy

372
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:58,111
Is Shadow drop shadow government Shadow infrastructure Shadow economy

373
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,647
It's like

374
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,999
Amazon has done sting operations with police forces where they put like a

375
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
GPS tracker in an Amazon box

376
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
And the Nae Nae

377
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,911
Partner with people who own ring devices

378
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
To surveil

379
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,983
Surveil their porches and

380
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
See if anyone steals them

381
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,799
So I mean

382
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
I think we're still like sussing out what the

383
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,687
The endgame is here but it seems that Amazon is trying to protect

384
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,759
Psych package delivery service by putting a camera

385
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
On the porch of every

386
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,599
Man woman and child home

387
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
In America

388
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,719
Well like every Great American Monopoly just becomes part of the

389
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
And speaking of another

390
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
American

391
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,839
Monopoly Monopoly

392
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
Gargantuan American

393
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,911
Tech company

394
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,471
We got a memo

395
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
From Google

396
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
Last week when I tell me what is about

397
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,127
Yeah we have got to Memos from Google in the last few weeks

398
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
That one was written by a woman who said that

399
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Company was

400
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
Discriminated against

401
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Her while she

402
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Is pregnant

403
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
And

404
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,903
Did she is title like why I'm not returning to Google after my

405
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,439
Maternity leave

406
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,999
And it was like maybe this 3000 word memo that she

407
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Descent 2

408
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,375
You know a few different internal listservs there and it went viral more than 10,000

409
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
Messiah before

410
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
Publish the article and

411
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
I'm sure more people

412
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
Now just be

413
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
A lot of people read that article

414
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
And it's basically just saying like

415
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
This is not a very good place

416
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
To work as a

417
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
Is a woman

418
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,807
I had I got a lot of snide comments while I was pregnant

419
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
You know I was taken from a leadership and management role and was

420
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
Play into

421
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,975
A non management role even though I had you

422
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,047
Perfect reviews and it stopped that love me and that's worth

423
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Nothing

424
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,887
And yeah that went viral within the company and then

425
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,959
Last week we publish another memo written by

426
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
A black and

427
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
Employee forum

428
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Employer

429
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Google who's

430
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Eat a little bit

431
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
About why he left

432
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
And he's he called it

433
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
The burden of being black at

434
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
And mentioned

435
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,503
The fact that

436
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,599
You know his colleagues were willing to talk about current events and

437
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
And had all these really strong a

438
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
Opinions on like politics and

439
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:13,791
You know Warriors and all these other things but then when it came to issues like police

440
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Brutality

441
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
You know the death of

442
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
Eric Garner at the hands of

443
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
If you know the nyp

444
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
PGE

445
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
No one

446
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Saturday thing

447
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
And then he started back setup with

448
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,079
Just mentioning that you know his

449
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,175
Collies were making fun of immigrants and making fun of

450
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
Aynax ensign

451
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
Stuff like that so

452
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,039
And it wasn't just that they weren't willing to speak

453
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Stop it was also that there were

454
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
You know some

455
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Overt

456
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,671
There is some over racism that he

457
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Experience as an imp

458
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
Employee at Google

459
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,511
Don't be evil

460
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
Let's talk about

461
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
Apple

462
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Any iPhone

463
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,727
Yeah let's hit all its head all the big

464
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,591
If you want to do the big five we can do it

465
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
So Apple

466
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,895
Apple

467
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,735
Sued this company called corellium which is a

468
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,295
I believe it's an Australian company but

469
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
It may not be

470
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,623
This is Lorenzo's domain I'm just

471
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
What is editor

472
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,023
That basically creates virtualization software for iOS so they are

473
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,327
Gripping the software from iPhones

474
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
Sandra creating it on

475
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
Computers so that's

476
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
Security researcher

477
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Can probe it

478
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,287
And this is really helpful for

479
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
For people who wants

480
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,079
To try to hack

481
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,359
And fine

482
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
I found zero days

483
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
Another exploit

484
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
And Apple

485
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
Is suing that company for bass

486
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
Copyright infringe

487
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
And this is

488
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
Big deal because

489
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
Black hat

490
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,487
Earlier this month Apple announced that it was going to be giving out

491
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
Hotstar likes

492
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
Security

493
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,839
Researcher Deftones

494
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
Two people who could then try to probe

495
00:20:55,167 --> 00:21:00,031
The iPhone in Find 0 days and it also announced it is greatly expanding its bug Bounty program

496
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:03,615
So they're basically saying like we're going to make it easier for researchers

497
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,431
To try to probe the iPhone so they can find vulnerabilities

498
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,455
And then

499
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,271
You know a week and a half later they're suing one

500
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,319
The company that makes one of the most important

501
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Diet research

502
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,696
Earlier this week it was discovered that

503
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:22,048
Apple made one up like a hilarious f****** a really bad one

504
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,864
Where they unpatched vulnerability that

505
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
They had previously patched

506
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,936
So they're on iOS

507
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
12

508
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,008
Stop for right now and on iOS

509
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,592
12. 3 day fix a bunch of vulnerabilities that Google headphone

510
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
In the iPhone

511
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,456
And then in 12.4 they unpatched one of them want to ask

512
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,784
And they still haven't fixed this a recording it like I don't know

513
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,832
3 days after this has been discovered

514
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
I'll probably be fixed by the

515
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Time is it

516
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:49,952
But for the first time in years

517
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
Someone has released a full

518
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
Jailbreak for an iPhone

519
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,584
For free to the public

520
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,888
Unless you stopping like all the time in the early

521
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Mm

522
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424
Because

523
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
People are finding bugs in the eye

524
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
All the time

525
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,568
But now because vulnerabilities in the eye

526
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
IPhone art worth so much

527
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
How much money

528
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,152
People are holding those very close to

529
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
The chaste because they're not going to lie

530
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Published

531
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,480
Vulnerability in the iPhone

532
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
They can sell for $1000000 to

533
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
USA or whatever

534
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
So

535
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,648
Yeah this f****** is so bad that

536
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
Set security reset

537
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:25,792
She's like well they're going to fix it a day anyway here's the jailbreak

538
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
You can now jailbreak your iPhone

539
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,608
For the first time in years

540
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
Crazy

541
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
Skype

542
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Listening to

543
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
Phone calls

544
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
Skype with listing of phone calls

545
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
4

546
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
The translation service

547
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,712
Contractors at Microsoft were listening to like if using Skype

548
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,736
Translate calls

549
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
They were doing

550
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:50,624
What Microsoft is calling machine learning which is better known in the real world as

551
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,928
People and Idea Center somewhere where

552
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,488
Underpaid and listening to it and making

553
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Ensure that the tree

554
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Nations were cracked

555
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,584
We also learn that they're doing this

556
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608

Facebook has been doing this

560
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
Google has been doing this

561
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,104
Microsoft isn't doing this so it's not a huge surprise but we talked

562
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Custom contractors

563
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,664

564
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,456
Been listening to both

565
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,272
Skype Cortana and finally

566
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040

The great thing about this Roundup is

570
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,744
Just a round up of all the

571
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
The Terrible Things

572
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,864
Yeah and then still do we have Facebook face

573
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,776

576
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,664
Is there a bike anti Hong Kong propaganda on Facebook in the same way that

577
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,968
The Russian government did in the lead-up to

578
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736

00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
To promote this stuff

582
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696

So that's a

586
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
That's another story that we wrote

587
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,984
Small news but we got to hit all the big companies so there you go

588
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
