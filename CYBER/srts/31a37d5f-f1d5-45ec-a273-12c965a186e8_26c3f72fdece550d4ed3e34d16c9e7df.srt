1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,280
Or walking to Defcon

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,304
What can we expect

3
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,888
So we're here at Defcon 27

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:10,240
The 27th edition of was probably the biggest

5
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,056
Maybe wear this

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,848
I can conference in the world

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,920
There should be 25000 30

8
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,944
Thousand people here

9
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,992
For the weekend

10
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,296
You are sounding way more enthusiastic than

11
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,320
Think your face yes

12
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,136
Should I start again

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,944
Virus

14
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
Eagle One

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,624
The package being delivered hackers spy

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,024
Eyes cops Silicon Valley Bros technologists and even politicians descend upon Las Vegas Nevada

17
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
Would become

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,400
Preeminent hacker conference in the entire world Defcon

19
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
For cyber journalism it's a Non-Stop store Sebastian social circuit in casinos or hotels with Larry

20
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
Top 40 hits in the site of high-profile arrest of hackers like Dimitri Skyler off in 2001

21
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,344
Las Vegas last week after he gave a presentation on software security at hackers convention

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,904
Clear up the porter say he is not a hacker

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304
They say he was drawing attention to security flaw a reference to the famous hacking movie War Games

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
All right

25
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:44,960
Flush the bombers get the subs in launch mode we are at Defcon 1

26
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,496
Wasn't always so mainstream

27
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,128
Besides countless infosec talks in Capture the Flag games used to be sort of an Arctic access

28
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,968
Attendees trying to outdo one another by infiltrating each other's devices

29
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:01,600
Or hacking personal information as you can imagine people take precautions at Defcon 2

30
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
But the paranoia runs deep I caught up with domaintools malware analyst salary at the conference talk just how

31
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
Seriously people take their

32
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,304
Surety

33
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
So do you buy the whole

34
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,264
Defcon like did you bring like six burners

35
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,544
And

36
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,896
I got 10 for a hat and a mask to make sure people and see your face like

37
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
What is this stuff

38
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
That's hilarious. No I

39
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:33,088
I run my iPhone and I run my MacBook in my iPad

40
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
And I

41
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
The only thing I do difference

42
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,464
And not really even a different is just I run a VPN

43
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
And even then you know it sucks

44
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,840
I don't want to say there's a lot of hyperbole but I think there's a lot of

45
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,656
Myth and would have been the mysticism and height

46
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,936
Surrounding

47
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,776
What happened to your Defcon and bsides and black hat and all these security

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
You know

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
Attackers are information

50
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,432
Security I should say are generally

51
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,040
I'm really busy right now we have a lot of things going on and we have a lot of events going on in

52
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,088
The notion that people are

53
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,648
I'm spending a lot of time trying to attack others is

54
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:13,280
It happens you can't say it doesn't happen because it does but the light we have to look at things through like a likelihood

55
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,352
And the likelihood of something bad happening is

56
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,192
Really really low you know to the average person walk in the cast

57
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Tina Flores

58
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,800
So I personally don't believe in the hype that much and

59
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592
I think it's a bit of a hyperbole just

60
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
Be smart about what you do

61
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,688
Like any other time

62
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,712
It becomes this

63
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
Really weird

64
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,552
Wave someone to tell you about

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
Ghost stories

66
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
Keep a call man I was once I was in a

67
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
Ever after my color

68
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,864
I'm like mr. robot nearly cannot it's just that con relax relax

69
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,936
It's so true man it is there's a lot of Indian OIC

70
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
I think that's probably also part of

71
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,544
The security Committee in general we like the kind of

72
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:01,664
I don't want a cigarette were falsely hyping up stories but there is a lot of like hike their work

73
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,504
You know I don't think it necessarily needs to exist all the time you know it's

74
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,600
It's not as sexy and it's not as sophisticated as people make it out to see me sometime

75
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
* 2

76
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
Strickland a sense of

77
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,488
People being attacked like personal people being attacked on

78
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Water just walk in the Casino floors and

79
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,631
Technology has advanced so much

80
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
That a lot of these comment

81
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
Acts are so much more difficult to pull off nowadays

82
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,287
So back in the day if we took a time machine back

83
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
10 years ago 5 years ago

84
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,151
It would take me about

85
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
In a 5 Seconds to jump on Saint on

86
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
Community WiFi network

87
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,063
And steal passwords

88
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Https

89
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,415
90%

90
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,463
Stealing passwords is it

91
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,767
Kind of complex now it's not as simple as that you

92
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,559
You know I didn't die

93
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:55,935
So the notion of oven Elite hacker being on the same Hotel network is you and stealing your passwords

94
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
The likelihood of that

95
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
Really really low my life savings LED

96
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
The odds of that happening to

97
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
An individual nowadays

98
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
Almost in

99
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,247
Avenues in the hotel Wi-Fi but I don't use Hotel Wi-Fi in most places

100
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
Just because

101
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
It's like it's clean as a hotel swimming pool

102
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
Like I think so I just

103
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Scene the mask

104
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,463
But the facial recognition masks

105
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,743
People are wearing and

106
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,815
Just all sorts of I mean I get it I get it but like

107
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
At the same time

108
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:30,751
I either like you must be playing dress-up or you're that stressed out for like

109
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,311
4 days and for me like I'm stressed out

110
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Having to chase

111
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Packers round 2 interview

112
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,711
You know I think one of the problems is due is that there's

113
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
A lot of self paranoia this

114
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,599
Community was Brad out of this paranoia right

115
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
Some people call it healthy paranoia

116
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
There's a thing called threat modeling to

117
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
And threat modeling just

118
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
To be super quick about it is just

119
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,631
Take a look at who is the type of individual that would attack you

120
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
How to build a defense around that right

121
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
If you're walking down the street and like a

122
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
Shady part of town and

123
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
You know you're going through an alleyway

124
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,407
You know you kind of have to threat model okay what's the likelihood of me getting

125
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Mugs here and

126
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,967
What do I have to lose and

127
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
Maybe I should just take a different street

128
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
There's a lot of individuals in this community and you know I know I'm going to

129
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Did I make you

130
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,695
Polysom enemies by saying it but

131
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
I think lyrics

132
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
There their way to

133
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
Paranoid about things

134
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,839
In a wearing these in a facial recognition mask

135
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
It's like wow

136
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
We're in the middle of Las Vegas worried

137
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
I thought the amount of cctvs in this area are

138
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
Overwhelming

139
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
Another

140
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,663
You know tons of people in a public areas like what are you I don't understand what you're trying to hide from or who you're trying to hide

141
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
And what's the likelihood someone's going

142
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,551
You know recognize who you are and what's the impact of

143
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
So what if somebody knows who you are right here

144
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
You know you have the threat model it but however if you're going to a country maybe like China where we've seen

145
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,303
Weaponize facial recognition

146
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:03,679
I think you have a legitimate case with Chinese government has plans to use this new biometric technology

147
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:09,823
Does demented Soul zartarian rule the country has ambitious plans to develop a vast National surveillance

148
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,943
System based on facial recognition

149
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,271
The likelihood of facial recognition being used against me

150
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,295
Fire

151
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,319
Absolutely

152
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
But if you're a bad guy

153
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
You know attending this

154
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
Because there are some

155
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,583
Do you know I would question you even being here but you know the ones that do and use facial cleansing facial recognition

156
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,399
Okay maybe I could see that I still think you're silly

157
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Traffic

158
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
You said you were that masking like

159
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
Your other

160
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
Like you become different in a Target like

161
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,455
Ironic that you're attracting more attention to yourself by wearing a mask that is

162
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
Design said like

163
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,783
Make you not be recognized

164
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,623
This is part of that hypocrisy that I see all the time in the community that

165
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
I just got a little bit kind of frustrated with like

166
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,999
For example out yesterday I was meeting

167
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
I was meeting at Buddy's buddy

168
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,095
And I was like all you know where do you work at and

169
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:05,631
The person does

170
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
Extremely paranoid and just

171
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
Said I work an undisclosed

172
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
Okay Manuel

173
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,103
You probably work at Arby's that's cool man whatever like

174
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:19,455
The paranoia is something I just I personally don't get

175
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,271
Because you have to throw model it otherwise you are just

176
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
Maximum stressed out all the time

177
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,647
I'm just trying to make conversation and say hey how's it going

178
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,695
You know where do you work what are you doing

179
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Met with like

180
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Oh I can't tell you where I work

181
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,583
Okay well I guarantee you don't work at the NSA so

182
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,399
What is an acceptable answer to the NSA

183
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
I totally get it like

184
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
Tell me where you work but

185
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
He do infosec for Arby's or something

186
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
I'm saying what you do right now

187
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
I work in

188
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
I agree with you

189
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
Certain point I'm like

190
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
He's going to ruin your life

191
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Cha cha

192
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
Try to run from this you know like

193
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
Got to just live your life

194
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
Spin the wheel

195
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
So my partner in crime in Las Vegas

196
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
Search for death comment

197
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,711
This year was motherboard reporter Lorenzo French

198
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
July

199
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
I caught up with him after

200
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
Give me his thoughts

201
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,319
Illustrious

202
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,599
27th year of death

203
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
And how the infosec

204
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
Cyber commute

205
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,023
Lorenzo Defcon 27

206
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Is it any different from the last

207
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
Either you've been to

208
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Anyway

209
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,215
Well in some ways it was a little different it was more spread out it was

210
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
Culver

211
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
3040 Calle

212
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
So it felt like it was bigger I think the organizers said they was around 30,000 at 10.

213
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,783
Please which I believe it's records Jose heard a lot of people say that people were nicer

214
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Which

215
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
I'm not sure

216
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
I can confirm cuz I

217
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
You know it's hard to tell but

218
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:10,047
I heard it inside on Twitter from a lot of people you know who noticed that

219
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,351
The goons who are also.

220
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,143
Volunteerism

221
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,775
And I'll do a little bit of security as well as mineral tell people where to go and help people out

222
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,079
Lasa

223
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,151
Aggressive in other years

224
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,455
Tube to put into context the Goons

225
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
So to have this

226
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,903
An attitude that it's collect Rollie and a little bit like abrasive by pump purpose and supposedly in an endearing

227
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
Greenway

228
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
But in the past few years people

229
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
And I'll complain about them because

230
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
They can be

231
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,303
Just rude

232
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,655
That's something I got kind of I picked up on because you don't pass use I've been there

233
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,679
There's always this

234
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
You know overwhelming fear of the Year again

235
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Actor

236
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,055
People are out to get you I'm a one year I think

237
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
15

238
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,359
I was told like

239
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Not even

240
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
Go near the cell phone towers

241
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
Don't even don't even turn your phone on if

242
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
If you don't want to go

243
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
Maybe we can come to this

244
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
If it's just this

245
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,623
Troll

246
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Traulsen

247
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
But

248
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,023
This is the first step, I think I've been to that I not only observed on Twitter

249
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
And in person

250
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
People being like nah I'm not about that

251
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
That toxic shouldn't

252
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:25,055
Yeah mean as I said I don't know if this is a concerted effort from the organisers or maybe just people growing up

253
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
I think it's it's a result also

254
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:28,895
Culture

255
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
In general

256
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Changing

257
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:36,831
You know earlier this year we we reported that there was a Facebook group pretty popular Facebook group

258
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,135
Made up of a lot of

259
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,951
Ratably well-known actors in the scene

260
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
I was like

261
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:47,071
You know sharing and commenting and talking about a lot of misogynistic

262
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Shitz and ditto

263
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,679
I'm putting down women and making racist jokes

264
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,287
And then some of these people were connected to a conference call derbycon

265
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
Obviously their Beacon

266
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,199
You know said that they were not responsible for their their volunteers doing this.

267
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,015
I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think this year

268
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
Israeli wine

269
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:11,135
Keep playing the accuracy and then realize that there was some

270
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
Toxicity

271
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:18,815
That needed to be addressed obviously the problems are still out there and I don't want to say that everything has been song

272
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,447
But the fact that a lot of people noticed that can be nicer is probably a result of this

273
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
You know

274
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,031
People just realizing that they need to do some

275
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,615
In general they need to be more welcoming because

276
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,455
Can always 2019 you can just have a conference where

277
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,223
Dudes

278
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
Stop

279
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,575
That I can seen is much more than just man

280
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,671
And the in some ways defconn is always being pretty welcoming you know

281
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
They've had this

282
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,511
Article queercon for years

283
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
You know it's very

284
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,399
It's very common to see a trans folks and

285
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:58,239
You know nothing on gender conforming people at Defcon

286
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,263
But

287
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,639
Yeah in some ways maybe this year was even better and even more welcoming and that's great I mean I think that's how it should be

288
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,199
At the same time so we had some people

289
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,527
Women calling out some of the the b*******

290
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,807
On Twitter which I thought was

291
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
It was excellent

292
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
Assertive

293
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
I could have said it better myself

294
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Sometimes when you hear the way

295
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Hackerman

296
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,535
Talk about things

297
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
It's not

298
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
It's not cool it's not fair and it's also

299
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Really aggressive

300
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,495
I just passed we were in there but

301
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,287
We had we are drummers

302
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,335
Or rather we heard reports that

303
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
During Defcon 101 which is basically the

304
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,735
The welcome to Defcon talk at the beginning of the conference

305
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
Some people are making

306
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,575
Inappropriate jokes

307
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:50,463
And that's obviously not great but I think the Silver Lining that is that they were called out and

308
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,279
A lot of people talked about it so probably next year

309
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
The organizers will make a point three

310
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
More inclusive and nicer

311
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
In general

312
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,983
The one thing we did was we asked so many

313
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
People when we got a lot of interesting answers

314
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
About what they think

315
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
You know

316
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
Writ large

317
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,479
The infosec cybersecurity community can do better we got a lot of things

318
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Comments

319
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
And I think

320
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,575
You know everything ranging from

321
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
People thinking it's toxic

322
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
If there's anything you think

323
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,255
The cybersecurity infosec community could do better

324
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
What would it be

325
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Be less toxic

326
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
More

327
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
Inclusive I try as much as possible that

328
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
There's

329
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,239
A couple of people in the industry were a big rockstars and

330
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
You don't make anyone else welcome

331
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
2

332
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,335
You know

333
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
People thinking

334
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
That the service

335
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
Yeah I think that's

336
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
It still

337
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,111
You know despite the fact that I do believe that things are getting better especially this year

338
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
There's still a lot of work to be done

339
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:58,303
You know it's still not easy to be a woman and infrasonic it's still not easy to be a black person in infosec

340
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
I think they can do a better job of

341
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Hiring outfit

342
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
African American

343
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
And there's a

344
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,567
A huge disparity between African-American representation at a higher level

345
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,407
You see African-Americans at the help desk to the system admin level

346
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,759
But when you start to go up to see So Co and Auto salvos

347
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:23,647
Senior-level positions you don't see a large representations of African-American so I think that as an industry

348
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,231
We can strive to do better as much as we're doing for women which is very great

349
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
I also think that we can make us a map for for African Americans

350
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Going to take a while

351
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:36,703
And it's got to be to take an effort from everyone you know a concerted effort to call out bad behavior

352
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,311
To make an effort to be more inclusive make an effort to be more welcoming

353
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
I know make a point that

354
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
Do you know

355
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,223
Despite what some people think you can be a good hacker without being a man

356
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
That whole

357
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
Idea of like hacking people getting hacked

358
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,343
You know very prolifically at

359
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,647
I desk on it mean that some really toxic

360
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:03,327
Yeah I agree and I think it's another way to put a barrier you know it's another way to scare new cameras and maybe even

361
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,679
And discourage them from coming to that, because it's it's unsafe you know it's like you're going to get high

362
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,727
In conclusion if we look at that sits

363
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
It's like

364
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031

365
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,335

00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,895
Security and it seems to be not slowly

00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
Sort of my takeaway from

370
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Miss lap desk

371
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:28,159
Yeah I agree I think it was encouraging to see so many people noticed that he was nicer and more welcoming

372
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,535
And as I said before I think that is a long time coming and it's the only way for the community to get better

373
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:43,263
This week's episode was edited and recorded by Brian Arnold posted and produced

374
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,359
