Did you know you can make money watching Netflix trailers on your phone

00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,560
Did you know that people have Earth thousands of dollars a month programming hundreds of phones

00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,352
To watch Netflix trailers

7
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,912
Video game trailers celebrity gossip shows

And sports

9
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,216
No one

10
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,240
Is really watching

11
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,056
Well in 2019

12
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,080
This was called

00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,360
Phone farming

14
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:52,480
Just imagine rows and rows of phone scrolling through social media apps

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,552
Simulate the engagement of a real human

16
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:59,392
All the while making money for their human overlords

17
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:04,256
Motherboard Joseph Cox dope into this world by making his own mini phone Farm

18
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,280
He's going to tell us

00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
Inside Story

20
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,120
Thomas bizarre phenomenon actually works

00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,912
I've been a coup

22
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,448
This is cyber

23
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
So Joseph

24
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,568
Let's talk about this because I

25
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,616
It's kind of sounds absurd to me

26
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
People are using multiple phones

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
Creating phone Farms

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
To get paid to watch Netflix

29
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:26,784

Yeah so you usually see these phones phones in China go viral weather Seas

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
Racks on racks

32
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,280
Cheap Android phones and people cooking through them

33
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,840
And that's the stuff like mini play some Facebook or

34
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
Who sing the reviews of an

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,728
Instagram accounts with followers

36
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,032

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,944
Ever wonder if it's actually legit and what could be behind those crazy Spike enter the world of Click Farm

In America

39
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,576
That all people who will buy dozens or hundreds of phones

40
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
And then they will get

41
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
Pays

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
To watch Netflix trailers

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
A video game trailer

44
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,024
Whatever it is

45
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
They will sort of chiba system

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
And instead of just getting paid

47
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,728
United by one company for one person to watch it

48
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
The game it

49
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,312
Bring as much revenue as bus

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,872
A gray area

51
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
It does violate terms

52
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,760
Service of summons

53
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,600
Elitist just show the phone farming is also

54
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Nothing in the state

55
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,464
Some people literally set up these multiple phones

56
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,048
Any Stoner dislike repeatedly watching these

57
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
Trailers these

58
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
Videos

59
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
And just racking up

60
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Views

61
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Withstand

62
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
Creates

63
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
Actual capital

Yasso

65
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
Explain the app

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
So usually

67
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
If you want a website

68
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
And there's an abscess

69
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Someone

70
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
Presently the company

71
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
It pays the effort to be that because they want to know if only put my product in front of somebody who goes to a sports website

72
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
To look at my trainer

73
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,440
Or something like that

74
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,232
There's another ways Knox

75
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Incentivized traffic

76
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Wechat

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
We're going to tell people if you watch this as well

78
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:19,168
We will reward you in some way

79
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
That might be freaking Essentials of digital coin

80
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:26,848
And if they get something else they could exchange it for a gift card or a free item or something like that

81
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,664
And in some cases you can even do it for cash as well

82
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
But if you do it enough

83
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,272
Legitimate reason to do that maybe

84
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,368
You're you're staying at home for a while maybe you in between jobs

85
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,928
And you want to get some sort of a

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,232
Disable School in Tampa

87
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
You may use one of these apps

88
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,632
It changes when people buying dozens hundreds of phones cuz clearly knows he's actually watching the message

89
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,168
Australis freshie Digest

90
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,728
Is this just one person with Hunter

91
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Pics of screens

92
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,544
And that's what the weather don't ya

93
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,872
Stuff comes in yet but there is a legitimate part of this boxing

94
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,200
Strategy blank lady gets abused as well and then that's where

95
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
Define phones coming

96
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,760
Dispensary

97
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
A bunch of

98
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Zombie phone

99
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Target

100
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
Eating up the strap

101
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,160
The only deal

102
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
Situation for the same phylum as if they would download the app

103
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
They will set up and then we'll need to be

104
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Minimal interest

105
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,607
Sometimes that can be the case

106
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:25,727
They will have to also have to download special software

107
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
It would then simulate

108
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
I click on the phone with

109
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,871
Because the Apple say hey you might see that

110
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
Because of course some of the app Developers

111
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
They don't want to become a pro diver they're trying to relationship

112
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
My business

113
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:43,135
Set in the same phylum as wolves download an app one coil switch

114
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:47,743
Replay the finger strikes on the phone so it looks like a human still in track

115
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,767
What's the device

116
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,071
And that's why you get to the real so sketch

117
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Treestuff

118
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
Some Farmers want to stay away from

119
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
Of others

120
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Fully embrace

121
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,239
I just got a fool

122
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
Grey Bicycle

123
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
So you actually made this a mini Farm protest

124
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Ethereal

125
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
Yeso

126
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,943
Most people I spoke to in the states

127
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
Who have a fan Farmdale have between

128
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
I don't know 2250

129
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
Maybe a 400 phones

130
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,439
Just to see how this ecosystem in the supply chain what I just bought

131
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:20,767
Cheap Android phones on eBay they were

132
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,351
2499 some ZTE

133
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,399
Much cheaper for $10 I was just

134
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
What's the rush

135
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
BMW used

136
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,007
The packaging was a little bit busted but

137
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
Vines

138
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,823
And I set them up with an app

139
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
Kool Pak TV

140
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871
Which

141
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,943
As we mentioned does allow you to watch these nuts

142
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
Netflix

143
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
Because it's an easy thing to show that

144
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,599
I'm pretty sure this company is going to be too happy

145
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,903
People aren't actually Digest

146
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,487
I tried it and I have a feel about it

147
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
But essentially I'm maze

148
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,303
Some money

149
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
From my phone's just shining through

150
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
It wasn't much money

151
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,471
I think in all we probably would have made

152
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
$1

153
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
Approximately over

154
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,383
Just a week. Before phones but again if you will

155
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,711
Racking up to 50 or a hundred phones

156
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,991
You can generate

157
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,783
More money as well

158
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:20,159
You do have to put in the work you do sometimes have to tap yes I'm still head depends how far you take

159
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,999
But there's people that have made thousands of dollars a month off

160
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:29,631
2017 that was apparently a pretty high points in an ounce of the year

161
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
As well

162
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,447
Every month excluding the winter mod

163
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,007
I was able to make over $1,000 a month from

164
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:40,895
And I got close to $2,000 a month in 2017 for the whole year but I never quite made over two grand a month

165
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,455
I spoke to said they were making

166
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,015
$1,800 a month

167
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,855
With quality phone but believes I have between 50 and 100

168
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
But with minimal interrupt

169
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
Passive income

170
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
It's coming from just doing us

171
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
It has however Maurice

172
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
Leeds

173
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
Going downhill

174
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,215
Apparently especially last year in 2018

175
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
PiZap Networks

176
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
It's not exactly clear you know

177
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,151
So the chicken-and-egg problem me that what came first

178
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,479
Irrespective Revenue dickow.

179
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
And these are

180
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,319
That's when Mike is much money on the phone phone is ultimately

181
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
Assemble make something like

182
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
$10 a day now

183
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
Prayers before you know they will make him a little more

184
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,839
It's all kind of reminds me very much so

185
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
The

186
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,191
You know the countless stories that came out I thinking sometime between 26

187
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
2017

188
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,239
Were you happy

00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,823
Around the world in China

191
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
In Iceland

192
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,431
Ancient Iceland

193
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
Endeavor

194
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,527
Mining for Bitcoins

195
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,879
Where did industrialized this this online digital economy

196
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,207
And it was just a bunch of machines

197
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Come mindlessly at work

198
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
And you had this human Overlord making money

199
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
Yeah definitely it does have

200
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
Some residents with that end

201
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,703
I should say there is a large

202
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Community

203
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:15,871
If YouTubers and other commentators around this and they definitely do also intersect

204
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
So what's up with the cryptocurrency

205
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,431
Take me to take

206
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:23,807
Some will be mining Bitcoin or base on a much smaller scale than if he say maybe the Chinese

207
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
Bitcoin Farms with something again

208
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,183
If I'm found to be on a smaller scale they'll be larger in China

209
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
The awesome the others will mine

210
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,767
Currencies as well

211
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,095
And just generally that resistance of Viber

212
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
Get rich quick

213
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,239
Some people do that effectively but I also imagine it can pull some people in

214
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
Maybe

215
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
Don't put that much

216
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,663
Fulton to it and maybe a spine of the phones and other very disappointed when the random 18

217
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
You know one or two dollars or something

218
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759
It requires a lot more for

219
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
I'm so sorry

220
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Ethical approach

221
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Anime

222
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
Annie's phone demeanor

223
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,487
They're obviously not buying ready-to-use

224
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,279
Brand new phones off the rack

225
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,559
What were they getting them

226
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,655
Yashow eBay is good one or two companies

227
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:15,519
Tracfone Account number do they make very cheap Android devices that get in there as well

228
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,079
Just online maybe Amazon

229
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,919
It doesn't matter if the phone is used inside of the one I bought

230
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
Apparently I couldn't even register it

231
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Because it was so old

232
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
It wouldn't work on the currents

233
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:33,951
Poutine that works at least that's what the personally by said in that was a reason he was selling them

234
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
As long as you have a Wi-Fi connection

235
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,351
And you can run these devices free that is absolutely fine

236
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
Of course

237
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,703
Some apps that come with the text that you are running

238
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,799
95 * 50 phones will from the same

239
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,383
Wireless router and then the same IP address to make it blocked

240
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,991
Ambi to have to go down to someone

241
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Volume

242
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,831
What are these companies that are actually

243
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,599
Paying for these

244
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Services

245
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
Where do I see advertising there their shows there

246
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Celebrities

247
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,511
Gossip shows

248
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
Sports

249
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
They can't be happy about this

250
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,679
Right so we didn't hear back

251
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,495
From Netflix but we can kind of use

252
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,311
The advertising or the ad Networks

253
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Approach

254
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
This was a proxy firewall that is

255
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Because I just

256
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,711
Big companies aren't going to be happy

257
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,527
The trail is a kind of

258
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
Fooling this

259
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Pretentiousness

260
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
Pitts window Visage

261
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
Pay attention to

262
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
The one person I spoke to

263
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,999
On that website was just discusses fighting farming

264
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,791
An app Network actually pulled out

265
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,631
Websites anymore

266
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,703
They believed because of her on the phone, please

267
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,983
Because they would just go

268
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
Today is Wednesday at Abu

269
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,591
And a prejudice

270
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:01,247
And sort of this or around this industry that people don't really want to be involved with and it's understandable you don't want to

271
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,807
An end-user client like Netflix or whoever

272
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
You don't want to be paying out Network

273
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,695
Distribution

274
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,303
Well now exactly me to come defeat the entire purpose of it

275
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,375
But what I do find interesting about this as well as that

276
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,911
You know you had some

277
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
Packer typekit or person

278
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:25,055
Prasad hits trailers in and saw the potential for them to

279
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:30,943
Create a bunch of phones just watching us and making money I mean there's something to be said about even just a.

280
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
Perspective

281
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,783
We're now in

282
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,135
Dimension there is this legitimate way that you like what I'm going to trade my attention

283
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
Well

284
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,303
Why don't you just pretend I'm a hundred people

285
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Do I get a hundred

286
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
And that's essentially doing

287
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
How much power does a

288
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
Because to me

289
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
Think about this

290
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
I mean she hook up a thousand phones or let's say 150

291
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
Phones

292
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
It's a lot of

293
00:11:59,359 --> 00:11:59,871
Power

294
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,223
Yeah I mean when people mine Bitcoin or ethereum already

295
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,295
Electricity cost

296
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,343
Because running a rig is going to

297
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
Emergency room signage energy

298
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:16,511
The American Founders I spoke to say I did bring the up but they didn't seem

299
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,839
Overly concerned about it and I don't know whether that's because

300
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,631
Maybe they just haven't paid that much

301
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,751
Maybe it's another business or whatever

302
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,079
Actually doesn't conceal all that much electricity I mean

303
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,871
We only did with full phones

304
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
So it's hard to say but

305
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:38,527
Android devices are going to take up a lot less electricity very generally speaking

306
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Then you know

307
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
A big Bitcoin mining

308
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
So

309
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:48,511
Yeah if you have enough time to take up a lot of electricity bill at least the people I spoke to wasn't overly concerned about it

310
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:53,375
But I may be just because they're not frightened the same scale losing massive Farm in China or China

311
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
This story I think

312
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
Just thinking about it

313
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,799
It's it's really about what the digital economy

314
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Has done

315
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
That this is the way that we're finding

316
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
Fighting to make money

317
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
I mean this is how we roll

318
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
How people are actually

319
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
$1,800 a month

320
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
That's a living

321
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
It's a living

322
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,671
Making digital

323
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
You know

324
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,023
Machines are slaves

325
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
Mimicking Being Human

326
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,655
There's always going to be people

327
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,495
Finding a way to hustle to scam around something in them

328
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,519
The reason I was

329
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,311
Attracted the phone Palms

330
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,847
In the first place Bevo

331
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,175
The large ones in China or even the smaller ones in America

332
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,711
Is that it provides almost

333
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,247
A physical

334
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Space

335
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
An artifact

336
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,575
Of

337
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
Prude

338
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Endocet

339
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,207
Only in Snapchat mean you made talk about Frozen all we really have to say

340
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
The human illnesses

341
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,071
Social media manipulation of face like so whatever

342
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,095
Physical space

343
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
Taking up in the actual Wells

344
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
With some dick

345
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,935
That's what you want me to

346
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
Well I look forward to the next

347
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
Weird-ass thing you bring to the table for us

348
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:18,367
Today's episode was recorded in edited by Andrew bercik I host of it and I produced it

349
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,463
You'll hear from us next week
