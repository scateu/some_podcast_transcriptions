1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Eagle one package being delivered at smartphones become ubiquitous

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
Pageants in everyone's pockets and purses criminals just like the rest of us have moved online and behind them

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
The cops and feds followed earlier we showed you how sophisticated cybercriminals forget it

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
Some of the most prolific drug supplier used What's called the

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
According to a report last year cybercriminals stool 16.8 billion dollars and 30

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
Percent of us consumers were victims of a data breach and it's not just run-of-the-mill credit card or identity theft fraud

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
Terrorist extremist groups organized online drug dealers sell their products in hard to locate online markets

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704
Criminals steal millions of dollars in cryptocurrency investors in high-profile Bitcoin

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,776
Authorities doing to stop them

10
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
Today we're talking to Elizabeth Roper the chief of the cyber crime Bureau in the Manhattan District Attorney's office

11
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,760
Roper's let investigations in dark web drug dealing

12
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,320
Sim hijacking and other cyber crimes

13
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:33,184
I'm been a coup and this is cyber

14
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
So thank you for coming down to the

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
Vice

16
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
Studios

17
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:42,912
Thank you for having me not often we get the government in here without By Invitation

18
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
So thank you

19
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
Well I have a lot of problems is a time so I

20
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
Thank you for coming in

21
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,152
Under these circumstance

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,992
So you obviously

23
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
Cybersecurity and hacking

24
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,088
It's kind of gone through this hole

25
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,136
Transition of the last 4 years

26
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
You know at one place

27
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Really scary

28
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,464
Packers

29
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
Hoodies on in their pants

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,632
You know I think we're getting to a point where we're all

31
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,400
Accepting

32
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Finally

33
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,240
That's cybersecurity and cybercrime

34
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,544
Is not something that's sci-fi

35
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
But it's a real thing and it actually happens

36
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,176
Now I guess what I want to ask you about is

37
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
How is that evolved the last

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
Decade in terms of the authorities in

39
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,576
Then your Tia's office actually looking at

40
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
Cyber crime and then also

41
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah sure so I think one interesting thing about

42
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
The perspective of our office meaning

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,400
A local Prosecutors office as opposed to a u.s. attorney's office the FBI

44
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,472
You know where our jurisdiction is is really Manhattan

45
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,872
Right and we work with a number of agencies we do some cases in-house we do some cases with the NYPD

46
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,200
We work we do work with Federal Partners often

47
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Service

48
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
Homeland

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,296
Occasionally the FBI

50
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,112
But we're really a local office and so

51
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
When we

52
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,208
The cybercrime in when we talk about cybercrime

53
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
We're kind of seeing

54
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,304
Really every part of

55
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
Like the supply chain

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,424
In terms of the information that's being

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,472
Compromising kind of monetized

58
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Via the Cyber Network

59
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
Mark Streit we're seeing

60
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
That kind of end users who are going into

61
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
Retail institutions in Manhattan

62
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,712
Financial institutions in Manhattan

63
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,016
And using for example

64
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
Identity theft victims

65
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,392
Social security number to open a bank account using

66
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,208
Credit card number to buy a MacBook

67
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
You know what have you

68
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,096
And then we also see obviously kind of the

69
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,936
Step up from that the recruiters were going out on Instagram who are

70
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,752
Recruiting people to engage in this kind of conduct

71
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,312
And I'm kind of on the other end of the spectrum

72
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,152
We're also working up the chain and seeing the more sophisticated cybercriminals

73
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
Who are operating

74
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,760
With a high degree of anonymity

75
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Who are

76
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,160
Monetizing that information once it's been breached to a writing the malware that's responsible for the breach

77
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
So we're kind of looking at

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,024
This whole universe of people and and you're right

79
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
There is

80
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
Kind of a veneer of

81
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,447
Mystery and an anonymity particularly with respect to the more sophisticated actors in so

82
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,751
It's a it's a real challenge to unmasked

83
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
Funny when you say it's your very local in Manhattan

84
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,503
It's like when I think local police I think I'm from Orleans Ontario Canada

85
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
And I imagine that the Ottawa Police are not as such

86
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,111
Fisticated at this

87
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
As you are but also because you

88
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
Deal with

89
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
Everyone

90
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
I mean everyone comes to the city

91
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
Yeah that's exactly right I mean I saying

92
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,143
I think we do have a pretty sophisticated operation

93
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
4

94
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Hello compressor

95
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Computers office for sure

96
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
Part of that

97
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:04,127
Is you're exactly right Manhattan is a hub of Finance at the Hub of retail

98
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
It's a hub for Innovation so

99
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,735
You know we have a big Tech Community here

100
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
And with that comes

101
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,343
All the types of crime that are associated with

102
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,111
Those business

103
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
I think

104
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,767
Another kind of advantage that we have that we're lucky to have is that Manhattan

105
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
For the past several years has had really

106
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
Low violent crime

107
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:30,239
Our office has been able to focus a lot of resources on this particular threat right weave

108
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
We've really

109
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
The DEA

110
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Has been really

111
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
Supportive

112
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:40,991
And kind of cutting-edge in terms of devoting resources to both the prosecution of cybercrime and also

113
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,575
The prevention of this kind of crime kind of recognizing that

114
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,647
A crime prevented is obviously a lot better than one process

115
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,487
You know you're you're within the government and you're seeing it from their perspective

116
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:55,583
And I often wonder is there sort of that generational change where it's no longer

117
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,655
Boomer generation of looking at the internet like the

118
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
It's very

119
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:04,799
Spectacular weird thing they don't really understand instead of seeing it as though this is dated at life

120
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,823
Cybercrime is

121
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
Simply just crime

122
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
And we all have to

123
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,503
Yeah I hope so I mean I think

124
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
One of the cool things about our office is you have a really multi-generational group of people you've got people who have been there for 40 years

125
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
And then you got people who are right out of Law School

126
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,791
And I think I'm on everyone there's certainly a recognition that

127
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,839
Quote unquote cyber is kind of

128
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
Apart of every case

129
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,703
It used to be the case that might be rowood

130
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
Filled every

131
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,335
Question a request having to do with anything that was sort of on the internet like

132
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,919
How do I go on to Facebook or how do I

133
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,503
You know investigate someone who's using email to

134
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,599
In in furtherance of criminal activity and I think now there's really a recognition that

135
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,671
That's such a fundamental part of every case

136
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
That we all kind of have to be

137
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
Literate

138
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
In that regard

139
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
And I think there is an increasing acceptance that just

140
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,007
These Technologies are here to stay and that's not a bad thing you know cryptocurrencies not a bad thing

141
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,151
You know iPhones aren't bad thing these are all just technologies that are kind of

142
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,759
Part of our everyday lives and have a lot of good applications and we just have to figure out

143
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,575
How to how to investigate crime in this new space

144
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,671
Does that ever ever have any those those moments where you want to go to the iPhone and you can't cuz

145
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,463
Let me try to do that recently

146
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,839
Somebody tried to do that

147
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
In our forensic lab

148
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,239
Does different digital forensics for the entire office

149
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:44,639
It's not just for my pierrot although they sit in my Bureau so I do get a lot of kind of visibility into what's coming into that lab

150
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
Increasingly I don't think this would be

151
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
Surprising

152
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,855
To anyone but it's increasingly mobile devices right we're getting fewer and fewer computers

153
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,391
More and more phones

154
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,255
Yeah sometimes they're lock sometimes it's hard to get into them

155
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:07,935
Is a fascinating new report out on how the FBI managed to crack into that iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters

156
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,727
Pain professional hacker

157
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
And that's

158
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
Yeah that's a challenge

159
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
For us it's one of

160
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Many

161
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
Are you aware that you have to

162
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,431
Purchase any software in order to

163
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
Get access to those

164
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,759
Does phones or is it something you do in the house

165
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
So

166
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,415
I would say the bulk of our work is is done in-house right

167
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,487
But we also like I think most kind of

168
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,071
Larger law enforcement agencies use certain software sometimes

169
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,631
To get around you know to get into mobile devices

170
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,447
Obviously is always accompanied by

171
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,031
A court-ordered warrant or consent of the device's user

172
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:49,407
But yeah if in those circumstances we've gone to a judge we said hey there's probable cause to look in

173
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,687
Inside this phone

174
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,735
The judge says yes I agree

175
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,271
And we still can't get in

176
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,599
Then yeah sometimes will employ like one or more I guess

177
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,903
But you would call workarounds or software is to

178
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
To try to assess

179
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
Do you ever get any pushback From the Ashes

180
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
Tow companies themselves

181
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Software

182
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
Devices

183
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
Well yeah I mean apple is obviously sort of

184
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,191
Been out there a lot saying we're not going to

185
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
SS

186
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Lawn Force

187
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,287
And getting access to our devices

188
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
There's been a lot of back-and-forth over that

189
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
I think the reality is

190
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
They've kind of

191
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,735
Made their decisions with respect to how their

192
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,807
Technology is going to work and so we're kind of in the position of

193
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
Doing what we can to get that out of

194
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
Right when you're in the

195
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
Perspective of someone

196
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Who trying to investigate a case

197
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
You're never going to just say oh there's this

198
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:42,143
Potential Treasure Trove of information that would help me can I get to the truth I'm just going to

199
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,935
Say oh well I can't look at it

200
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
That's so you're going to try

201
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Obviously within the bounds

202
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,311
I know what you're authorized to do to to access

203
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,151
This scene is kind of a win-win in that way where Apple gets

204
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
Privacy first face and you guys get

205
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
Actually get

206
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
Beijing Yuan

207
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
I don't know I mean

208
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
This is

209
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
Just my opinion

210
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,647
I think

211
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,487
Look the Privacy aspect is obviously incredibly important

212
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,791
I think the downside is that you have

213
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,583
Companies making this decision

214
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
Write Caesar

215
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,935
Businesses that are making decisions for business reasons

216
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Arguably

217
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,519
When the outcomes are really public policy outcome

218
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,615
In my mind be decided by lawmakers

219
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,639
And not by

220
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
Providence

221
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
And there is a giant debates

222
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,111
I mean I'm sure you probably get this question a lot but what is

223
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
What are the more

224
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,415
Crazy

225
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Things you seen

226
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,231
In your Tanner

227
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
Yeah that's

228
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
That's an interesting question I mean

229
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
We've seen kind of

230
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,447
A whole range of things we handle a lot of

231
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,007
It's primarily kind of financially motivated

232
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
Cyber crime rate so identity theft bank fraud

233
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
We handle some kind of

234
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
Straight up cybercrime law

235
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,551
Online festive intellectual property or other

236
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
Data

237
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
We handle

238
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,975
Some online child exploitation cases

239
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,535
I'm some cyber stalking cases obviously

240
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
We both can be a little bit crazy

241
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
We had yesterday

242
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
Relatively large case announced

243
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727
Where

244
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
My Bureau was able to identify and take down three New Jersey residents who are operating a pretty low

245
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
Scale narcotics operation

246
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
And that was a first for me because we don't

247
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,575
Typically in the cybercrime and identity theft Bureau prosecute a lot of

248
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,647
Big drug cases but this was a case where

249
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,463
These particular defendants

250
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,791
As it's alleged at least at the stage

251
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:52,959
Operating a darknet sort of storefront on the dream market and also a specific site

252
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,751
That was accessible via tor

253
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,079
To sell Alprazolam vs xanax

254
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
Academy in

255
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
And possibly some other controlled substances

256
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
And they were

257
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:07,807
You know using the anonymity sort of afforded by that technology

258
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,111
Accepting Bitcoin and then laundering the pros

259
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,439
Then it was via the money-laundering angle that we should have came into it

260
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,535
And were able to take down this pretty significant drug organ is

261
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
So how do you go about

262
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
Intercepting the evidence you need

263
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,959
In order to build this case I mean

264
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,567
Is this I'm assuming that you are not doing this I'm assuming that you've got a team of what

265
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
Forensic type

266
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
People that

267
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Well then

268
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
Do you for you

269
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
Yes or Bureau

270
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,039
The bureau is supervised is actually a really dynamic

271
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,087
Group of people which is one of the things that allows us

272
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
Space

273
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,207
Obviously we have attorneys we have about a dozen attorneys who come with

274
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:51,071
You know different backgrounds themselves some of them are former narcotics prosecutor is summer former

275
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
Street crime prosecutors

276
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,703
But in addition to that we do have a forensic

277
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,031
Laba pretty state-of-the-art forensic lab that staffed by

278
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,335
About a dozen forensic technician

279
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,687
And those guys are really interval to the work that we do they're kind of like

280
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,039
The X-Men I think they're like each one of them has a different sort of specialty

281
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
Weather at

282
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,159
You know getting into encrypted devices or doing vehicle forensics

283
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
They're doing forensic

284
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
Exxon

285
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
You know

286
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,999
Android devices

287
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
Apple devices

288
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,375
That work is really important in terms of building these types

289
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,447
And then we also have a team of

290
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,263
Dedicated sworn investigator so essentially

291
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,311
Like detectives but people who works

292
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
Specifically for

293
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
The District Attorney's office

294
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,199
And they'll usually be the ones who do the kind of

295
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
Work that you're describing right like that

296
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,807
Val go online and conduct an undercover

297
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,367
Purchase of Contraband whether it's drugs

298
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Identifying

299
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
And so that's typically how we

300
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Get that information

301
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,119
The one burning question that I wanted to ask you and you

302
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
Personally I want your personal take on this

303
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
A bad decision your ad

304
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,263
So you get on the MTA

305
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
The New York Subway system

306
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
Do you log into the freeway

307
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,895
I would not login

308
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,735
The free Wi-Fi you would not want you would not log into the free Wi-Fi why is that

309
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:19,391
You know I'm not I'm not a technical person so I can't talk to the ins-and-outs of kind of cyber hygiene

310
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Decision

311
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
I'm doing that versus not

312
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
I've just

313
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
Thin enough cases of

314
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,375
People being compromised to such a devastating

315
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
Affect

316
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
From the MK Wi-Fi so sorry

317
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
I totally cool

318
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,895
I hate it but got to go on

319
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
Yeah any any open wi-fi I'm just

320
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Terrified of

321
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
You say no

322
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,111
How much I mean honestly cuz I think to myself too

323
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,159
Damara hotels here

324
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
How much are those

325
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Targets

326
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
For cyber criminals in terms of

327
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:58,815
Clearly you're getting

328
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
Very International

329
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
Yolk line hell

330
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
Yeah

331
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
Those must be

332
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
Absolute Honeypot

333
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,775
Not that I didn't think that

334
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
Hotel wifi

335
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
Cleaners at the hotel

336
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Hot tub

337
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,919
Right yeah I think that's probably

338
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
Analogy

339
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,551
We've seen yeah we've seen hotels being used

340
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
For that purpose

341
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
You know

342
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Both

343
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,975
5 people looking to

344
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
Take advantage of the Open Wi-Fi and and

345
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,167
Conduct some kind of intrusion or learn information about a Target

346
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
And we've also seen it used

347
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
By criminals

348
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,311
Looking to kind of mask who they are and what they're doing

349
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:46,687
And that's probably more frequently what we encounter right we're trying to figure out what who was

350
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Doing this bad Act

351
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Using

352
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
The IP address of

353
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
Such-and-such busy

354
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:55,135
And so we're typically trying to kind of unravel the thread from that

355
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,231
New York to tell me who but

356
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,559
Has there ever been anything surrounding Trump Tower

357
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
We

358
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,799
Interesting question has there ever been anything surrounding from power we don't have any open investigations that

359
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,919
Right there was some cyber activity there I think sometime in 26

360
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
Waterfalls in your jurisdiction so I thought maybe

361
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:24,575
Yeah I know I think that that's a fascinating story

362
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,415
I've read a lot about it

363
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
But yeah we don't have anything Act

364
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,535
With respect to

365
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,935
Are you seeing any Trends right now that you see something that

366
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,215
People should be aware of

367
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
In terms of

368
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Falling prey to cyber

369
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,799
Criminal within this city

370
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
That you say

371
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Yeah I think

372
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,455
I think there are a number of things that are kind of trending right now in the in the

373
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
Cybercrime space

374
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:58,367
I mean you guys have covered the Sim swapping phenomenon I think and that's something that

375
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,183
We're certainly seeing a spike in

376
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
I used to get those complaints

377
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:07,327
You know years ago when people were doing

378
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Sim swaps

379
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,167
Targeting kind of the OG handles or

380
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,727
You know traditional Financial

381
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,007
Again

382
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:19,615
But with the Advent of crypto and the increasing popularity of it increasing

383
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
Sort of legitimacy

384
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:24,479
Cryptocurrencies I think

385
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
We've seen a huge uptick

386
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
Infant slapping cases

387
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
You know partially because I think you have a lot of

388
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
People in Manhattan who are active in that space

389
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
And also just

390
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
The ease with which

391
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,375
It can be done and I think people to serve realizing that and and

392
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
Taking advantage of it

393
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,263
So that's something that makes me nervous just because it is such a devastating

394
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,591
And it's so easy to do

395
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
Another thing that

396
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:59,039
We see all the time that we're just getting inundated with our what people and kind of law enforcement called business email

397
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Email compromise

398
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Cases

399
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,879
So that's the type of fraud where

400
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
Someone well

401
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
Breach one or more email addresses

402
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Within

403
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
Financial transaction or

404
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
A real estate transaction

405
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
Something like that

406
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,887
Belle learn enough about

407
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
The transaction that's happening

408
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,287
I just want to be able to socially engineer one or even both parties and

409
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:24,895
So for example you know if you're my real estate attorney and I'm about to buy a house

410
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
A fraudster might

411
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Breach your account

412
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,551
Send me an email either directly from your account or from a spoofed

413
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
It looks like it and

414
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,903
You know kind of mimic your phrasing or

415
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,487
The end of the way that we typically correspond and say hey

416
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,815
The plan has changed instead of bringing a cashier's check to

417
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:46,655
To the closing just wire your down payment to this account

418
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
And

419
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
It happens a lot with businesses

420
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
But we've also seen it happen to individuals like in the real estate example and it can just be incredibly devastating because they're

421
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Entirely wiped out

422
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,759
And unlike credit card fraud were typically you have some coverage from your

423
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
Credit card company

424
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,135
These are transactions that the victims are authorizing and so the banks

425
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
Typically won't

426
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
To never get that money back

427
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,463
I usually

428
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Wow

429
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,047
Yeah so that's an incredibly

430
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,327
Problematic type of crime

431
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
We're seeing

432
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:22,239
Obviously New York City criminal syndicates are well known around the world

433
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,287
Various

434
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Tattoos of Dave

435
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,407
How are they leveraging

436
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,431
Cybercrime

437
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,479
I'm thinking of the

438
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,503
Typical players

439
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
How do they use

440
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
At all

441
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,927
The typical players meeting so I'm thinking like cartels and thinking Italian mafia

442
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
Thinking

443
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
You know

444
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
The various

445
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,767
Communities of

446
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Gangsters

447
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,583
Okay and how are they

448
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
Leveraging this

449
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:54,751
So I would say what we see is more chemistry crime organizations leveraging this

450
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
The staff so

451
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
We have a lot of

452
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:02,431
Defendants who are current or former gang members who

453
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,759
You know maybe even have long records for violent crime

454
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,063
Who suddenly will find themselves

455
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,903
Running an identity-theft organization and going on

456
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
Tour on two legs

457
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,743
Pescador jokerstash or one of these

458
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Higher

459
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
Profile carding shops

460
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,119
Buying credit card numbers and sending people out

461
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
To use them

462
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,447
And I think there's been a realization

463
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,263
Among criminal organizations bad

464
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,103
This is a much lower exposure higher-value type of crime

465
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,407
To do and so that's something that we see a lot

466
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
I haven't seen

467
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
You know more kind of

468
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527
Traditional organized crime

469
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,575
In the cybercrime space although

470
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
It wouldn't surprise me.

471
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
Going on

472
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,463
Missionary it sometimes you work with a national

473
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,487
Agency partner

474
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
Yeah

475
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,535
DHS

476
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,583
FBI unassuming Calaway CIA

477
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,351
Smother

478
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
And I said maybe

479
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,935
We don't really have

480
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,983
A national security folks

481
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
That's right so we're working

482
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
More more with

483
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
The law enforcement side of

484
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Of things

485
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,759
So while NSA and CIA are focused on National Security issues primarily we're focused on

486
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,783
Traditional lawn for

487
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
And so

488
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
Crime that happens

489
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,976
Usually in the United States with that affects the United States and then can be prosecuted

490
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
I'm in the Uso

491
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
We haven't really work

492
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,864
Match with National Security

493
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,936
Organizations I mean our interests are

494
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
I don't want to say

495
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,776
Even necessarily aligned you know

496
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:37,664
We will sometimes share knowledge about you know oh did you like have you survived realize that this

497
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,992
To exists or you know this information is

498
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
This is kind of out there but

499
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,320
Typically know we're working with traditional on

500
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,648
Cuz I'm just thinking I mean this is New York City you have

501
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
So many people coming in and out

502
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
Including some of the members

503
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
Agencies

504
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
De autos

505
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
Yeah and also you know you have the UN here

506
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Yep

507
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Right

508
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,984
So you know that you didn't have the UN Summit every year

509
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
When

510
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,800
Traditional law enforcement lock

511
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
What's this city down

512
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,408
In such an insane way I can only imagine that

513
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
You

514
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
Somehow Havoc

515
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,504
Affection

516
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,040
You know what enters your orbit

517
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
When that happens

518
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Since when you have UC

519
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
Jeep Summit

520
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,928
Is there any counter

521
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,744
Espionage counterintelligence or decide to

522
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
The work you do

523
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
No I mean we're not you know

524
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,936
Mayberry obviously we're s or a pretty sophisticated operation in

525
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
The cybercrime space

526
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,264
But no we're not doing

527
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:38,080
We're not doing Espionage cases we're not

528
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Really looking at

529
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,640
State actors

530
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
We're not

531
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
Investigating

532
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,272
Any kind of like nation-state attacks

533
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,064
Or activity or anything like that

534
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:54,720
It's it's a lot more more traditional and buy traditional you know I don't mean unsophisticated Wheatley certainly

535
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,280
We prosecuted foreign Nationals who are

536
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
Conducting

537
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,120
Attacks are committing crimes that touch

538
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
New York City

539
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,680
But it's

540
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
Mostly financially motivated

541
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
Cybercrime right it's not

542
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,848
Espionage it's not politically motivated for the most part

543
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,664
It's usually what kind of Financial in

544
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
How did you get in

545
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,016
Did you think you were going to be

546
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Doing

547
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:22,368
Cybercrime Giovanni background of that nothing I'm trying to you know

548
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,000
With all due respect I mean I'm not I have no technical I didn't

549
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,816
Take any computer science in University either

550
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,120
Yeah my friend

551
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
She didn't either

552
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,936
It's all right with the lawyer

553
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
The lamest

554
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,384
I call you guys vampires but lets you know what will play full play nice

555
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:50,016
We can talk about that later no I don't have a technical background at all

556
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
You know I

557
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
Majored in English in French

558
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,880
I came to the DA's office and

559
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,464
Starting out almost everyone handles kind of every type of

560
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
Crime that

561
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,048
That comes in and I personally found

562
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,888
The kind of complex Financial crimes and cyber crimes to

563
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:10,240
To be among the more interesting because they involved a lot of proactive investigation

564
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,848
As opposed to a street crime where they cannot come in the door and all the investigation is done

565
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,640
And you're just moving on to

566
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
To prosecute the case

567
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,480
So in my gyro we do

568
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
Kind of most of the

569
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
Work is upfront

570
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:28,160
Proactive investigative work so we're trying to kind of put together those puzzles and

571
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
The

572
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
You know if we can kind of put someone

573
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,536
As they say behind the keyboard or

574
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,888
Figure out kind of what the distribution network is with the money laundering that

575
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
And I just

576
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,008
Have I found that really interesting and have been really lucky that

577
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
Our office is incredibly so

578
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,664
Supportive of this kind of work and have gotten the opportunity to work on more and more kind of cool cases

579
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
In the space

580
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,296
Can you can you talk in Broad Strokes about some of the

581
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,088
Investigations you have going on right now

582
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,904
Yeah sure so

583
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
I think I mentioned that

584
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,792
We've seen kind of an uptick in Sim swapping and we have one active

585
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
Case that's

586
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,960
Been a little bit publicize where we had a a 20 year old Ohio man

587
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,312
Doing Sim swaps of Manhattan residents and others

588
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
As it's alleged in

589
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
In the complaint

590
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,640
Pick up a case is still pending

591
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,224
And we have a handful of other

592
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,528
Search similar investigations were Manhattan recipe

593
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
I've been targeted in

594
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
Similar scams

595
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,368
I could talk a little bit about

596
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:34,464
A few recent historical cases that are that are not active but that might be

597
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,256
Interesting

598
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:42,400
One case I think that illustrates was kind of like a breath of the context that we see was a case against

599
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
Originally 17 descendants

600
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:48,032
But only three of them went to trial the trial happened in 2000

601
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
13

602
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,872
It was a trial again

603
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:56,224
Well it was an indictment against a business called Western Express and then a number

604
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,296
Of people who were either employed by that business or used it

605
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,088
And this was in the days of

606
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,696
Pre cryptocurrency digital currency so things like e gold and webmoney

607
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,768
And Western Express was a business that

608
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,096
Essentially acted like an exchange for those

609
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:17,216
Digital currencies and you had people in the New York area

610
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,008
Who are using that business to

611
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:19,776
Hey

612
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Carter's

613
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,360
In Ukraine and Russia

614
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,152
To get compromised credit card info

615
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,968
And then that money was being laundered

616
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,064
So we were able to identify and prosecute both

617
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
These kind of

618
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
Local people who were

619
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:39,232
Find this information and then using it you know to buy cars to buy

620
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,560
Clothes to buy whatever and install stuff on eBay and

621
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
Kind of enrich themselves

622
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,400
And then we were also able to identify and process

623
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,520
That kind of credit card with a called dumps vendor right who is selling

624
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,056
Credit card information

625
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,664
Online and in our case he had sold about a hundred thousand credit card numbers

626
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,712
That have been used fraudulently

627
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
And that person we were able to

628
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
To apprehend

629
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
And increase and extradite

630
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,368
New York and try and

631
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,208
So that's kind of an example of a think what I'm talking about is like

632
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,000
This whole ecosystem kind of

633
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Converging

634
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
Manhattan

635
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,352
Yo it I mean I can I can imagine in

636
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,424
It's the nature crime rate at some point

637
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:25,568
International is going to end up in in Manhattan exactly was that was that a Greek national

638
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,616
He was a Ukrainian national

639
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:32,224
Who we had identified and we were able to learn that he was traveling to

640
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,576
And I think you see that a lot right people who are making a lot of money

641
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,648
Conducting cyber crime they want to

642
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,464
Have fun they want to spend the money they want to go on vacation

643
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
He was traveling to

644
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Degrees

645
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,792
And we are able to work with

646
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,584
International authorities in federalist

647
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
Do you see a lot of

648
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,728
Actors in Ukraine kind of involved with cybercrime here in New York

649
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,264
Yeah so we have

650
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
Part of our Bureau

651
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,592
Is

652
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,616
The cybercrime

653
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,456
Intelligence unit and so that's a small but very specialized

654
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:07,296
The people who are conducting these really long-term proactive invest

655
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
Applications

656
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
Into

657
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
The types of criminals that I just

658
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,976
Describe right people who are traditionally overseas who are

659
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,304
You know kind of this Elite

660
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
Group of

661
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,632
Cyber criminals who are

662
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,216
Conducting breaches monetizing the information that's

663
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Betaine VIP

664
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Breeches

665
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
And

666
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
I don't want to say those

667
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
People are

668
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,664
Necessarily located in Eastern Europe

669
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
But they're all

670
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
Frequently

671
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
Russian-speaking

672
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,576
Until we found that that's a that's a skill that that's important to have

673
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,392
Because that has sort of

674
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,184
Emerged as like the language

675
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,464
Pitressin

676
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
That's said that

677
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
Governor that

678
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
Yeah

679
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,704
Are you saying Russian hackers have been in the news recently

680
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,616
I don't know I feel like I read that somewhere the latest in the DNC email scandal

681
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:09,760
Is that the FBI suspect the hack was perpetrated by Russian intelligence in an effort to elect Donald Trump

682
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,088
Forgiving SNL's McIntyre jokes about Russian hackers

683
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,720
Yeah I think it's it has been in the news recently for for the kind of

684
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,328
Splashy politically-motivated activity that we've been seeing but

685
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,680
From the perspective of a financially motivated activities

686
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
It's obviously

687
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
For a long time

688
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,032
So another sort of

689
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,848
Case where we saw this kind of convergence

690
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,456
Transnational and local cyber crime was a case where

691
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:43,296
StubHub have been breached and they they identified

692
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,696
Thousands of user accounts that have been victimized by account takeovers to essentially compromise passwords and usernames

693
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,512
I've been used to log in and take over

694
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,304
Thousands of users accounts

695
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
And purchase

696
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,864
Pic of using music

697
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,656
So either using

698
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,056
The stored credit card information that you have on file to Stubhub or using credit card information that have been stolen and some other

699
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
Either way

700
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,640
Millions of dollars of tickets

701
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Were purchased

702
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,200
And then resold

703
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:16,064
And with the investigation found was that these local individuals were

704
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,856
Responsible for

705
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
Reselling the tickets

706
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,976
I'm at a much lower rate and kind of laundering the proceeds

707
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,328
But they were getting instructions and getting the tickets in the first place

708
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,632
From a Russian national

709
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,448
Who was actually conducting the account takeovers

710
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,032
The painting that compromised credentials conducting the account takeovers

711
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:41,408
Buying the tickets at kind of market value and then passing them along for resale

712
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,968
And the money was being laundered

713
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,992
In the United States

714
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,808
I'm in Canada in the UK

715
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,928
I'm in Germany and so that was actually a case that we collaborated both with

716
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,256
The city of London Police on with the RCMP in Canada

717
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,792
My best friend

718
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:58,816
Is that right

719
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,120
Yeah I know we're actually were in court together

720
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,960
I didn't get no like right now I got a court date

721
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
When this comes out

722
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
Albion Court

723
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,944
Wait were you the money launderer in Canada who is

724
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,992
Glad amazing at hacking

725
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,296
Really good at it

726
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,648
Yeah so that was that was another really

727
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,696
Cool example of

728
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,536
Working with International partners with local partners

729
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
2

730
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,656
To bring down not just the kind of end users of the information but the

731
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,936
The higher-value targets

732
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,752
It's right who are who are actually breaching

733
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
Accounts

734
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
The information

735
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,384
I could be mistaken

736
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,968
And my mind's a little fuzzy on this but I think the Mueller investigation

737
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
