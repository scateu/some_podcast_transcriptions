00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
And what was that like

28
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
And what were you doing there

29
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,872
It was really

30
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Weird

31
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,944
That's like the main way to describe it

32
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
It was super weird

33
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
So I went to China because

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
A few months ago

35
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,624
I saw someone

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
Tweet about

37
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
An open letter

38
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,304
That was posted in the Wall Street Journal and I think maybe the Washington Post

39
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
From a senior official at

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
Huawei

41
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Is this Chinese

42
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:47,936
Medications company

43
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,520
And the open letter was like you know hey

44
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,592
Is a lot of controversy around us right now but

45
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
We want to give people the facts

46
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
And Us Media you guys deserve to get the facts

47
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
So send us an email

48
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
We're going to give you the facts

49
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
And I was like

50
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,064
I like facts

51
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
That's

52
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:10,464
Literally my job so I sent them an email not knowing what would happen

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,768
And in the reply was like okay great

54
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
Come to China

55
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
Okay cool that sounds

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,168
Crazy

57
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
Back and forth for a couple months

58
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
And then they were like

59
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
But it was extremely bagel

60
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
And then this

61
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,664
PR guy came to the office with like

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,016
Head of US Government relations for why that I came and met with us here

63
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
A few feet away from where we're recording this

64
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,464
And they still didn't come to China

65
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,512
4 week and we'll show you stuff

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,072
About Huawei about yeah

67
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
And like we're just going to we're going to take you

68
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,400
Behind the car

69
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:51,936
And give you the tree

70
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,520
And also you'll be joined by 10 other journalist

71
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
More likeable okay

72
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,152
Yeah this could be pretty interesting

73
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,040
The jungle itself will be really weird so be good story and they're going to let us film stuff

74
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,136
I mean in the lead-up to the trip we had no

75
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,720
Like I had to get a Visa approved to get a journalist Visa approved

76
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
Which is

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Apparently extremely rare

78
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,839
And they weren't like they were not sending us

79
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,375
This letter we need

80
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
From

81
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,495
Their headquarters or whatever to take to the consulate until two days but

82
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,127
Yeah oh man so we can I go and I like to submit it and I can have

83
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Weave

84
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,991
And then like the night before my flight I still didn't have my journals Visa

85
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
So I told why I like guys I just

86
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,623
These are like you waited until two days before they're like that will work on it

87
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
Send like 30 minutes later I get a call from the car

88
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
Your Visa is approved now

89
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
I like okay cool

90
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:54,399
So I go and pick it up the morning if my flight was weird to me this company that claims have no

91
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,447
Allegiant Sartor involvement

92
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
To the Chinese government is like

93
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,055
Is able to quickly pull strings to get visas approved

94
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Yeah that was a weird

95
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
Pretense

96
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,175
And then you went

97
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,991
And was it what they had

98
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,783
Promise to you

99
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,599
Using look behind the curtain

100
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
So we started in

101
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,439
Oh God there's a whole other thing

102
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
Which I still don't understand why and I

103
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
I think my guess is like

104
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,071
For surveillance purposes

105
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
But they had a

106
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,215
Start in Hong Kong and then once we are in Hong Kong for they're actually going to start the trip in mainland China

107
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
In Shenzhen

108
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
Try to stay ran away Hong Kong one night

109
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
For no reason

110
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,895
So we went to Shenzhen and then we had a meeting

111
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,175
In the hotel lobby

112
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,711
The hotel

113
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
Was owned by Wawa

114
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,063
I was coming to Amber Plaza

115
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
It looks like a

116
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,647
Nice hotel but

117
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Company

118
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:55,327
Until we sit in the lobby was there anybody in its yeah there are a lot of people in it and it had its own little like Village of life

119
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,375
Like food and restaurants and stuff

120
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,167
And I mean apparently it's like

121
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,775
Huawei employees from around the world in like vendors and people that they bring to China stay there

122
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,615
Is there any way we sit in the lobby with the

123
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,223
Actually when we told you they were tender and was coming from places

124
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,759
Forbes and wired

125
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
What we actually man

126
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,343
Is a guy from

127
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,903
Telecom trade magazine and an Instagram

128
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:27,071
Black slacks that you flew all the way to China to hang out with an Instagram influencer

129
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:32,959
Just what you always wanted this guy was really nice but he didn't even

130
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,799
It was like a extremely alert ear

131
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,895
Instagram influencer and he did

132
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,735
He did ads for Huawei like he is receive money for them

133
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,039
And then the telephone trade guy

134
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
Was doing branded content for a while

135
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
So we were the only actual journalist on the strip

136
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,231
I wish we found out only once we were in

137
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
China

138
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Well

139
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,375
I mean I was you I'd watch the peace

140
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
And the one thing I kind of strikes me about it is that

141
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,495
You definitely have this sort of

142
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
Dislike

143
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
North Korean

144
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
Government junket

145
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Propagandistic

146
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:13,919
Feel to it

147
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,991
Maybe not as obvious he's extreme

148
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:17,759
But

149
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,111
I mean did you feel like it was something like that you feel like you were being spied on during the

150
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
This junket

151
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
So actually I had a lot of

152
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
Surveillance anxiety

153
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Going into this

154
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
I spoke with someone who

155
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,167
Was a reporter in China for like a decade

156
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
She was telling me like

157
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
Tell me the words to use for now

158
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
Forecast

159
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,271
So yes I had a lot of anxiety especially because

160
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,367
I know they were going to Fondren was fine whatever but I was also like

161
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
Going inside the company

162
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
That would

163
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:04,351
Like assist in building the technology and spying on journalists or like would have the capability or like Runza Networks

164
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,399
Feel like

165
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
I was going to be like Devil spider

166
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,775
Sorry I was having a lot of stuff and bring that a laptop with you

167
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,871
You know I brought a laptop but never opened up I brought a burner laptop

168
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,199
How can I just never, you swear on her phone

169
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,503
When I went to the consulate

170
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
New York City I didn't

171
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
Tight yeah and I assumed

172
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
4 compromise the whole time

173
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
This is actually not included in

174
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
The peace pipe

175
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,535
In the in the lead-up to me going

176
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
There was

177
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,631
Nike the DHS find out about this somehow

178
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
And I got like

179
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,567
I kind of like set up this call but they had already known about the trip somehow and we're like

180
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,591
Very keen

181
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,383
To know every detail of the Trap

182
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
What's and then at the end

183
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:55,807
Of the car were like yeah and you're just like assume that you will be on camera at all times especially in your

184
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
Oh yeah

185
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
I like

186
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,207
I guess it's like there's nothing I can do

187
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,535
Tell me I'm still trying to figure out if there's any like surveillance

188
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,143
Had experts listening to this out there we stayed in many hotels in many different cities

189
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,471
Every hotel room I had with always right next to the elevator

190
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Why

191
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,823
Why there's no way that's a coincidence

192
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,103
I feel like it's real

193
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
What time I left the

194
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,967
The Huawei own hotel at like

195
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
For I am mostly jetlite and I want like

196
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
Smoking cigarette

197
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
I had a guy like Follow Me Down

198
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Call me back

199
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
For one thing it could be

200
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,951
Is that

201
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,743
They put you on

202
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,839
On certain floors that they would put people they will see value

203
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,167
And they put you near the hotel near the elevator

204
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
But you wouldn't go down further

205
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
Into the into the actual floor

206
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
And see how there's nobody there

207
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Oh

208
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
That's

209
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,223
Yeah I'm heading Elsa could have rooms like that that are surrounded next to it that are also there in order

210
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Stern actually rooms there

211
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
Fake doors

212
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
That are

213
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:04,671
It's maybe it's somewhere where they actually literally like a backward right now staring at a

214
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
At a window where you can see

215
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
It could very well be that

216
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,815
Right yeah that's that's one way of doing it

217
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,399
I've heard a lot of weird stuff like I've had that happen to me in Russia

218
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,471
But one thing he's doing the Cold War was

219
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
I used to go in

220
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
And take a s***

221
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
In your hotel

222
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Room

223
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
And just leave it there

224
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,455
Like mind as a like

225
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,015
We can do whatever the f*** we want to do

226
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,439
There's a lot of weird tricks but I'm sure you were a hundred percent being spot on

227
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,231
You might have been hot honey potted

228
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
I'm sure they probably tried to see what was going on there

229
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Yeah

230
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Yeah I mean I really

231
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,143
It was weird because I was like

232
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
Maybe

233
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
Like I'll get a glimpse of it

234
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
In some way

235
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,127
Like a tweet they took us to this the state-owned Telecom

236
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
China mobile

237
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
China mobile

238
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,503
Crazy has like 900 million Subs

239
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Lycoming Street times

240
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,855
Population of America

241
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,439
They were showing us like 5G antennas on the roof

242
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:15,839
And there was this guy with like a huge DSLR just like taking pictures

243
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,399
Like this guy's taking pictures of it I don't know who this man is

244
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,775
And then like a PR guy at the end of 00 he's just like from some communist

245
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Oh okay

246
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
Picture

247
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,431
Yeah it is it is very weird

248
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,479
It is all happening

249
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,759
Surrounding service

250
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,087
You know if you're listening to if you listen to Trump he wasn't even other

251
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,927
Punnett on both sides of the aisle

252
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Yeah you know this

253
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
5G

254
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,583
Who's going to win ultimate battle I've seen it described as

255
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,887
Ask parallel to the new clear

256
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,983
Race or parallel to the military-industrial complex that we're trying to get

257
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,799
Countries to buy our stuff and not Russia stuff

258
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
Now it's China but now it's wires

259
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,127
It's the internet

260
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,151
I mean

261
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,503
It's clear that like Huawei is also under attack

262
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Yeah

263
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
Yeah I mean there's just like really fascinating dynamic

264
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Going on

265
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
In that

266
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,743
5G supposedly this revolutionary technology the internet speeds

267
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Dance master

268
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,559
But no one else

269
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,119
As it stands like in this current moment

270
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
Really has the capacity to build a fire

271
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,495
There's Huawei

272
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:29,823
China and then there's like Nokia and Ericsson and you're up

273
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
But they're like

274
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
12 to 18 months behind

275
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
So

276
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
You know unless you really want to be

277
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
Super late to this you kind of

278
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,087
It seems like you might have to go with Huawei

279
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
And there are

280
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,695
You know Western countries that are happy to do that like Germany

281
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
Is

282
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,023
Proceeding even though the US

283
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,327
Intelligence agencies are telling Germany that

284
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,375
We might share less intelligent

285
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
This extremely valuable

286
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
Your intelligence

287
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,751
If you use

288
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
Huawei products

289
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
Jeremy doesn't seem to have

290
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
A problem with that

291
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
There is a lot of like

292
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
Really smart people

293
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,807
Who questioned the accusations that the US

294
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
How does it make you feel when you hear the rhetoric from the US government when they imply that Huawei technology

295
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
When she has a back door in it

296
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,607
And not Chinese surveillance agencies could

297
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,423
Use that technology to spy on people around the world

298
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
Will Jada

299
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
Inkkas shoes

300
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,311
Beagle

301
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,407
Salem111 argument rights of scenes I think it's

302
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,503
I think this might be the most accurate and I'd love to see what you think of this

303
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
Is that

304
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,367
The concept of them using those networks and spying on us

305
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
It would likely won't be any easier

306
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
Or harder than it saw it already is for them

307
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
And

308
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,583
To protect intelligence to protect your Networks

309
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
Do you really need

310
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
Huawei American

311
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
Cables to do this

312
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
Like it'll probably doesn't matter either way

313
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,055
But the question is

314
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
Does global influence matter

315
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
More

316
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
Importantly then

317
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,431
The sort of intelligence

318
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,015
Right I mean that that's certainly part of the question because it's like

319
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,039
Will be here

320
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Make a ton of money

321
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
I think

322
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
There's also concern

323
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,927
Lyca leverage points

324
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,487
When your Networks

325
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
Manufactured by the

326
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
Chinese company that

327
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,399
And clearly has some involvement with the government

328
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
Some capacity

329
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,471
It gives them leverage in

330
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Negotiations like the trade deal

331
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
Where they can

332
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,103
I don't know what the last software update

333
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
Or patch

334
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
To your mobile network

335
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Degrade them

336
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Or if you want to get

337
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
Like really apocalyptic

338
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Turn them off

339
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Yeah like

340
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
Or like how Russia right now even

341
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,695
Even though I will threaten Eastern Europe

342
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,255
Every once in awhile that. Shut off the Natural Gas

343
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:01,119
Cops yeah yeah I mean just like any of the stuff that Russia has done to Ukraine over the

344
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
IMobile

345
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
So I mean

346
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:10,591
Is there a backdoor embedded into every

347
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,871
Chloe motherboard

348
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Bike hard to say

349
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
Well will it give them leverage if

350
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
All the Americas Networks

351
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
Use

352
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
Their infrastructure in technology

353
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
Yeah I think that's a good breakdown

354
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,487
It's almost like they're using this this this siphoning of information back door

355
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
Argument

356
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,047
As the more compelling

357
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,095
Argument against them

358
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
Weather Network Phyllis rating

359
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
The best that you can sell to the

360
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,983
You think like that mean in Chinese

361
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
But how about the Chinese kid

362
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,335
Stop you from

363
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Engagement internet if

364
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,895
Something goes awry

365
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,943
What is harder to sell

366
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,735
Like you kind of sound

367
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Make a crack pipe

368
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
When you say that

369
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:56,671
I mean you know it's true it's probably the more plausible argument of the two but they're like

370
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:03,839
Like when you can just you know it helps your argument rhetorically when you don't have to really explain it because you'd be like

371
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
Listen is classified in like

372
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
The Chinese are doing Espionage and

373
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
All the stuff is top-secret and listen live

374
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,799
We're telling you the best stuff we can hear

375
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,639
There is a top secret document there is a lack of information

376
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
How to backup

377
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
That is just like

378
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,319
That's the biggest thing to keep saying that

379
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,135
But getting to that this has been going on for

380
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Yeah this is just

381
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
This year

382
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,487
I mean the US government

383
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
Along with most five eyes countries

384
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Have

385
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
Ben

386
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,423
Sort of excluding Huawei from bidding on things like emergency service Networks

387
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
4 years

388
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:44,543
And they been doing the same things in brief inverted I'm from Canada Red briefings

389
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
But the conservative government did had

390
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
Years ago saying

391
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
We cannot let Huawei

392
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
Get access to

393
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,551
Our Network's cuz they will spy on us

394
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
Security top secret

395
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,879
This is not a new thing it's almost

396
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,999
It's coming to a head I think really and I mean like

397
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
China mobile the state on

398
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
Telecom has been petitioning the FCC

399
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,399
To enter us markets

400
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
For like

401
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,239
8 years now and just got denied

402
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,775
Very recently

403
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,311
Time this has been something

404
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
Keep playing out for a long time and is now

405
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
Now being Amplified by

406
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
The fact that

407
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
5G Networks

408
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
And and I think

409
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Relationship

410
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,391
But the really funny thing is is that

411
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
I think what we're describing is

412
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,463
Especially given your trip

413
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
China

414
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,583
So you couldn't really get any answers from Huawei on anything

415
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
And then oppositely

416
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
Here in the US

417
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
From our government

418
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
They're doing the exact same thing

419
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
Yeah they're saying beware of

420
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Chinese spying and not really

421
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
Providing any real evidence to that

422
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
So it's it's kind of

423
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
Case of what's going on

424
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,295
I mean what were you saying that the US government has lost

425
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
Sister bounces well

426
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Yeah

427
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:06,463
Right yeah I mean and and they're not willing to actually disclosed the surveillance that Huawei

428
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
Is or isn't doing honest

429
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,791
Which I'm not

430
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
Obviously

431
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
Agree they probably are but

432
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
They're not providing anything

433
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,751
To substantiate that in a very public debate that is actually going to call

434
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,287
Serebii

435
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,079
Very important going forward

436
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:26,687
We've been we've been like you theorizing here a lot but there was

437
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,991
One thing that I I found out

438
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
For sure

439
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,807
That fits like shotgun

440
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,647
That day it was set I mean we all know it to be true

441
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,695
But it was so shocking that they

442
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,303
Like fumble this so hard and let us film it was kind of incredible

443
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,119
So there's this amazing Dynamic on the trip

444
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,983
There are Chinese people people people who works for Huawei and lived in China and work in China

445
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
An American PRP

446
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,287
There is a time

447
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,639
There is an American who lives in Hong Kong when he lived in New York and one who lives in terms of

448
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,991
And set the chase fellow chase ya Chase

449
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
Cisco

450
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,575
And so one night

451
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,391
All the pr people go out to karaoke

452
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
And get really drunk

453
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
Until 4 a.m.

454
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
We did not go out

455
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
We were like

456
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,047
Resting is studying and

457
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Camping guide

458
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,679
Breakfast we find out that they're all super hung up

459
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,751
Which is amazing

460
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
And so great Ambassador question

461
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:31,199
And so like no one really knows what's happening on that day or the Torah like eating breakfast and I'm just kind of like

462
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,783
What's going on and no one really knows what they're doing that morning

463
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,831
Eventually a Chinese proficiency

464
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:42,207
Let's go to our store in the mall it's like 20 minutes down the road so it'll be fine the American PR people are like

465
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,279
Great we've never been to one let's go

466
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,607
So we walking in a camera drawing

467
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,191
And it is an exact replica of an Apple Store

468
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,591
It is not inspired by or influence their similar to is literally an exact replica

469
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,687
The wood grain on the tables the badges that the employees were wearing

470
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,991
The way the products were aligned

471
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:11,903
And I was like oh my God I just interviewed a senior official the company yesterday who told me that the company does not steal intellectual property

472
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,231
They were standing in this like church of solid Electro property

473
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:21,631
And so I saw the video and you were very frustrated it is and it you are completely right

474
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:28,031
Apple Microsoft

475
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:34,431
I'm Samsung and I'm pretty sure everyone has very similar Concepts and terms of the stores

476
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:47,231
Fundamental differences in their stories

477
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
Do you

478
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,607
Stupid do you think we are like this is

479
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,263
You're being very rude to me by bringing me here at the straight-faced I'm not appreciating this

480
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,103
American Handler said that to you

481
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,455
This isn't this is there's an amazing memory the American Handler

482
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
Chase the pr guy is like

483
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
Smart outlet

484
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
Samsung store in Microsoft store

485
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,391
You know what really differentiates

486
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
Is here is the product

487
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Products interesting

488
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,328
And I turned to my right and there's an exact airpods knockoff like the exact

489
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,608
Just a Huawei

490
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,752
And I like how that up and I was like all I just kind of just like put these in your ears and like they float on are they just like

491
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
Locked away after

492
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,568
He was not

493
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
My friend with me

494
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,456
Ask. We did not have any more casual conversation

495
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Well

496
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
You know

497
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,624
He was wearing Shades inside the store actually in the in the in the peace

498
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:53,280
And I didn't clock that but now that I know that the backstory podcast

499
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:58,656
There was that PR guy we had a WeChat group of just like the pr people in US

500
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
Coordination

501
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:04,032
At like 3 in the morning he sent a message to that WeChat group. Just said

502
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:10,432
No it's just that help really just a help

503
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:21,696
At what what did happen they went to karaoke there's this with one last PR person there

504
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:27,072
Has helped others just layer of weirdness to me is just like

505
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
Dislike bumbling operation of trying to convince us

506
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
And it was just like

507
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
Falling apart at the seams

508
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Every minute

509
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,312
McNeil no knew what was happening and why we are going your way

510
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
I mean

511
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,920
This is also like that that service theft

512
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,968
If a property is

513
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
Is also very common

514
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:52,416
But the Chinese government Source said that this isn't true it never happens and you bring out like the j-20 fighter for example

515
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:58,048
It looks exactly like the F-35 the same thing man

516
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
When

517
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
Chinese five-spice

518
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,144
Exactly

519
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,984
And there was another thing that I'm I'm actually not

520
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,824
Sure about that I don't want it I don't want to like strongly make this allegation

521
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,408
But they but they took us to an R&D facility

522
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,504
RR testing their smartphones

523
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:21,344
And there they showed us a video and it one point the video showed kind of this

524
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Mechanical arm

525
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,952
Touching a screen a bunch of times to kind of test

526
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,488
You know that the screen works at

527
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Price of the million times

528
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,888
And I wasn't sure if this is the exact same product but one of the things that Huawei is a LED strip

529
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Stolen is

530
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
Then call Kathy

531
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,264
From T-Mobile which is a device that test

532
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
The screen a lot of times

533
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,848
And I was like is that

534
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:49,760
You are not authorized to ask this question I was like what are you talking about

535
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:55,136
But this is by the end of this year but I was like okay well we weren't even allowed to film in there so I was like okay mental no

536
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,696
Yeah they showed us the thing that they bite

537
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:02,816
I got to say your frustration really like in the peace

538
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:09,216
You can see this the steady decline your color as a glaze

539
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,520
Yeah you're the weird part about it is like

540
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:17,920
It went down it was down down down as miserable I want to come

541
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:24,320
Because we went we went to Shanghai and I didn't notice but we are staying at the Ritz-Carlton oh my God

542
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:29,952
It's like they brought it you know they brought us there and they would have paid for it like a

543
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,280
We had let them they would have paid for these very fancy

544
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
Hotel rooms

545
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,608
And they did pay for it for everyone else who's on the jump

546
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,936
Trademax influencer guy

547
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,776
They had all their food and lodging pay for any we paid for it because

548
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Ethics and standards

549
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,408
I just like being there in this room that I could never hope to afford

550
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,248
On this trip that taught me literally nothing with 17 hilarious

551
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,296
So that I mean that's why there's a CNY

552
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:01,952
Laying in the bathtub

553
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:08,608
That's when you've lost your mind

554
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,400
Yeah

555
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:15,008

00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,568
I watch the unedited footage of that

557
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,872
Seeing them in the bathtub the other day and I was like

558
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
I forgot about this but I was literally cry

559
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,200
