Eagle one package being delivered

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
Known that the simple alphanumeric password or just the simple password wasn't enough to secure our identities on

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
Online nowadays stuff like two-factor authentication and send jacking I become a real thing

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
Step verification help save others from accessing your account Improvement

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
Red 2 online identity management IRL lives in

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,112
Inseparable in the midst of an online identity crisis

7
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,416
Maybe

8
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
On today's show we're talking to Wendy nather and OG the infosec world who knows a thing or two about identity

9
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,584
Daft

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Vacation

11
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:14,752
She's with the top people working on this problem for the successful startup Duo security when he Central problem

12
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,616
Which is all really everyone's problem can we actually secure our identities online

13
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
If not can we manage to fall out of constant breaches I've been Mac who and this is cyber

14
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:31,648
English opening

15
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
How are you doing

16
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Good good

17
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,072
So we wanted to talk about the Integrity of your online identity but I wanted you to take me back

18
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,656
When did passwords in the internet for personal accounts

19
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,192
Really take shape

20
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,240
When did they really take shape well

21
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,824
You know I think somebody decided at some point

22
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:55,712
When there was only one system you could log into that just remembering the password was going to be okay

23
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:01,088
And so you know using fallible organic matter for primary credential storage

24
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
What's a good idea to

25
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
But it's not anymore

26
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Clearly

27
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,976
Cuz all of us have

28
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,280
Are dozens or hundreds of accounts now

29
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,912
That's the thing is like how you keep track of all of your password people use password managers but even that

30
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
Interview bit of a pain

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
It is really difficult

32
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Because not

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,848
Everything works seamlessly together across all the difference

34
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
Devices

35
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,176
Susan platforms that you want to use or application

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
So why did the password itself

37
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Become you don't like

38
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
The username and the password

39
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
Become the norm

40
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
Will a

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,928
At the time it was the only thing that

42
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Wasn't

43
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
Dependent on

44
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
Physical security so

45
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,424
It used to be when you logged into the Mainframe the only way you could do it was by going into the building where it was

46
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,496
And getting access to the terminal that was hardwired

47
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,336
And the Assumption was if you could get in that far you were supposed

48
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
Used to be there

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,128
Do you mean

50
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
Back when the internet was first created

51
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Abacus

52
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
For the internet

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Was created

54
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
It's like when the first computer

55
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
Was credits

56
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
How far back

57
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,184
Yeah yeah pretty much

58
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,256
These computers are more accessible you can get your hands on them

59
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,024
You would

60
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,608
Be able to work with him or maybe all of 20 minutes at a time

61
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Flipping switches

62
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Putting info

63
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,168
Paper tape

64
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
For something like that

65
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
By the 1960s

66
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
Computers has become very

67
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,592
Inaccessible in very difficult to use

68
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,920
Because everyone was so worried about the economic

69
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,016
I learn programming on Mainframe computer

70
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,808
In 1974

71
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,880
The whole basis for the username and password goes back to the

72
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Physical

73
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,720
The actual physical act of going into a building

74
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,024
And having to login with your name

75
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,048
And your past

76
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,144
Yeah absolutely until that the only thing they figured out was

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,240
Well let's make sure that Wendy can't login as Fred

78
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
So let's just

79
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,288
Nino

80
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
Give Fred a password and tell them

81
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,944
Never to you no tell it to Wendy or anybody else so that was the one Secret

82
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:03,968
That nobody

83
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
Share with you

84
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
The only thing that was only yours

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
And

86
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,344
At that time again it was

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,368
Consider good enough

88
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
Then the internet

89
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:19,071
Hello virtual reality

90
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:25,471
Interactive appetite searching for a website

91
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
Write an in even been when the internet or what what later became the internet was first being to

92
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
Developed it was still on multi-user systems that everybody logged into it one system

93
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
And everybody shared that the

94
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
Personal

95
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
Computer wasn't the thing yet

96
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,487
So you still needed

97
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
Individual password

98
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
For those

99
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
For those users

100
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
M&e personal computer did come into play

101
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
Play and so did the internet

102
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,447
We just by the fact okay

103
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
Kept the same

104
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,239
Password

105
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
Security measure

106
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,543
In places we did

107
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,615
Right if you had one PC

108
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
And you had one

109
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
Someplace else you thought well I'll just

110
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,503
The same password it'll be easier to remember that way

111
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:15,903
That really didn't change for a long time because I mean even if I think about it for my own standpoint

112
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,463
Like two-factor really

113
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,023
Only was widespread I would say

114
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
Is a widespread

115
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Very

116
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Nervously

117
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
Like 5 years ago

118
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,495
With 95% of breaches involving account takeover

119
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
Two-factor authentication is the most effective method

120
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Prevention

121
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:39,199
Yeah you will five years ago I started using two-factor authentication with hard tokens

122
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
About

123
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
24 years ago

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,551
Wow

125
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,599
But I mean mainstream use

126
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:46,879
Chestnut Inn

127
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,231
Right right so we know it was an Enterprise usage

128
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
For very sensitive

129
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
Critical systems

130
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
And it didn't become a

131
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
Consumer thing until recently you're right

132
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,215
Is there any notable acts that happened

133
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
In terms of Internet Security

134
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Where

135
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
We were forced

136
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,079
2

137
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Username and passwords

138
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
System doesn't really

139
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,991
Well it became

140
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
You know it is

141
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
As the web

142
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Spread

143
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
Peoples

144
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Your consumers

145
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Started using

146
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
More and more

147
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
Different websites

148
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,791
You know by default again they started using

149
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,351
The same passwords across all of those

150
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
And not only

151
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Where are those passwords

152
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
Generally easy

153
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Gas

154
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,591
If you knew anything about the user they became easy to reset

155
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Because

156
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,663
Again the more presents

157
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,735
People had a mind the more you can find out about them

158
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
And use that demography

159
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,135
To pretend to be that person and reset the password

160
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
At the same time

161
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,975
Criminal started stealing

162
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
Passwords wholesale that weren't being

163
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
Stored securely

164
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
So they didn't necessarily have

165
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,887
Crack them

166
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,775
War it was very easy to crack them and then they could go around trying them everywhere

167
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,103
So is this the 90s on this first of it happening in terms of utilities

168
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,383
Identity theft

169
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,247
Passwords and crackers yes pretty much

170
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,319
You know if they have you ever seen war games

171
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,975
Where the character David Guetta found out where they wrote down the password for the school computer

172
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,839
They change the password every couple of weeks but I know where they write it down

173
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
There's lots of different

174
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,679
Or finding out somebody's password but that's

175
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
We started back then

176
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Cisco's back

177
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Pretty far

178
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
It sure does and it's

179
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Just now reaching

180
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
You know critical mass

181
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
Where it is

182
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,247
Becoming an everyday occurrence

183
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
It's the people's

184
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
Passwords are being stolen in different ways

185
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:53,855
And

186
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
You know that there are a lot of just

187
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975
Problems that we're running into

188
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
When we need to let

189
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
People use those accounts

190
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
About hours

191
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,607
For good reasons but

192
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
Don't need to be able to show

193
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,167
That we gave

194
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
Information that they didn't just

195
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
Spray control

196
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,127
So he was back in the 90s and obviously you've been around infosec for for a long time you're in the game

197
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,967
Weather experts like yourself who are sounding the alarm saying look like

198
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Like this

199
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:24,063
This pattern of username and password is really not

200
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,599
An effective way to

201
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Peoples

202
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
Online

203
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Identities

204
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,999
Oh yeah absolutely people have been saying it for decades

205
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
And why hasn't changed

206
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
Because the risk

207
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,375
You know the impact

208
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,911
Breeches

209
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,543
Hadn't been strong enough to get people to move away from what would otherwise be a vegan

210
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Convenience

211
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,639
If you need somebody start memorizing different

212
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Strings

213
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
Of of passwords that was too hard for them

214
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,295
And they figured well it's a very very

215
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,063
Small wrist

216
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
That I'm going

217
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
Since I'm just going to keep doing the

218
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,951
It was easier for me

219
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,743
For the most part at work

220
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
But we finally got into

221
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,839
The point where anybody

222
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,631
And get breached wholesale

223
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:12,959
And now people are starting to think well maybe we better do

224
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,031
What are the alternate

225
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,615
What we are working on a lot of different options

226
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
So

227
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
The measures that we've had up until now

228
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,223
Using different fact

229
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
Indication like tokens

230
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
Or apps on your phone

231
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,623
Those things are getting better

232
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,999
Some people still find them to be very clunky but we're working on additional standards like Web author

233
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,815
Also called

234
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
Where we hide a lot of that

235
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
Machine-to-machine

236
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:47,519
Negotiation from the user so they don't have to do it or type it in themselves

237
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:53,663
If you think about all the users who are just using Touch ID or face ID on a mobile phone now

238
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,503
Because it's so much easier than poking at it really tiny keyboard

239
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,039
You'll see the direct

240
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
That we're going in

241
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
To get rid of past

242
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
Two biometric Olmos

243
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,535
Facial recognition Biometrics or Oregon yubikeys things like

244
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
Physical toll

245
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
That you can plug into your

246
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,887
Computer and just have to say

247
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
You know yes

248
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
I'm here please log me in

249
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,727
It's almost like we're going back to

250
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Physical options

251
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Refused

252
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
For time immemorial

253
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
You're right where

254
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,895
Kind of going back and forth and trying

255
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Print things and

256
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,503
And saying you know well the ER this is lot easier touching it is

257
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Easier than typing it

258
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
So

259
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
Can we just do this instead

260
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,415
I do remember watching Demolition Man

261
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
In the 90s

262
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,095
I think it's Wesley Snipes character steals an eyeball from somebody who has their eyeball

263
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,167
Recognition and remember thinking to myself there's no way

264
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
I will live in reality

265
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Eyeball red

266
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:55,615
Will you would think so it actually I just saw a trailer with the new Fast and Furious movie

267
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
Where one of the character is

268
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
Yo has an unconscious person in

269
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
Slamming his face up

270
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
Thanks and it keeps saying access

271
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
Denied Wham

272
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
Access denied

273
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,231
So if you know that's that's still part of our pop culture and

274
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
That's going to be part of our daily life

275
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,631
Would you say that we are right now at a crisis

276
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
Online identity

277
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
I would not say it's a crisis

278
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
But we are getting to

279
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Maybe discomfort

280
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,823
It's a better thing or

281
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,895
Is that the problems are getting wider and

282
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Ben Weider

283
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
Spread

284
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
So what one of the examples

285
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,575
If you need to let somebody else access

286
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
Your account for some reason

287
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,951
There isn't a really good way to do it you know if you have

288
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,767
A two-factor authentication app on your phone

289
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
But they need to get into your account do they switch it to their phone or do they use your phone you give away your phone

290
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
And then what about

291
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,775
The application that you're trying to log into that

292
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
Trying to detect

293
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
Weather in attack

294
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Got a hold of your password

295
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
Prodigy

296
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,711
Are you going to run up against their fraud

297
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Detection even though you have

298
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,015
Permission to be in there

299
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
That's a big problem that we haven't solved today

300
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Uses for the exchange of a

301
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Accounts

302
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
That seems almost unheard of to

303
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
2 Exchange

304
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Credentials could essentially mean

305
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
Eaton said she packed.

306
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
Medication it's like

307
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,631
I'd give my account name my username and password

308
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
And my two

309
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
Two-factor to let's say

310
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
My partner

311
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,335
All the sudden and they have to change my number from also my number

312
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
It gets very complicated

313
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,967
It really does and I ran into this problem when

314
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,295
I had to take care of my parents after they were in

315
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Capacitated

316
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,391
When my father had a stroke I had to break into his

317
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Computer

318
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,999
And into his email account so I could reset his banking passwords

319
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
And continue to pay their bills

320
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
Because there wasn't a good way

321
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
To say

322
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,959
And you know to go to the bank and say you know he's been incapacitated

323
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:57,983
Can I

324
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
Can I take care of this because

325
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
He wasn't dead

326
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
I wasn't

327
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
The inheritor of

328
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,175
I just needed to get in and help out

329
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,759
So what we don't have good mechanisms for that today

330
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
Yeah

331
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
Simpler icing people there's

332
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
Has been controversy around people

333
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,415
Losing your Instagram

334
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
Instagram

335
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,719
Has

336
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,743
Time of

337
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
Your password or

338
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Decide your

339
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,607
Breached

340
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,423
And it's no longer yours and proving it's yours

341
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
I mean things like that are happening and

342
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
And it seems for the

343
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Simplistic

344
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Because you think to yourself

345
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
It's just an Instagram

346
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
But the way that we live our lives right now

347
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
I mean our online lives

348
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
These are very much are

349
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:40,479
In real life

350
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Lights

351
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
Yeah yeah very much so it's

352
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
It's yourself it's your identity it's your reputation

353
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159
And

354
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,975
You know we know how crazy things

355
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
Guess when something goes viral in the

356
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Romwe

357
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
I don't want to be a Luddite

358
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
Or something but part of this

359
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:04,799
The obvious question to ask is Will should we just sort of quit parts of the internet and go analog like should I just

360
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Go back to the 19

361
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,919
81 and you know right things.

362
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
Not use the internet as much as I Care Limited

363
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,855
Yeah I I don't know if that the Bible answer I know that that people pulling back from using it

364
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
White so much

365
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,183
Can be you know very healthy

366
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,535
But yeah for all of the business that we have to transact online

367
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,863
I don't know if there's any good way to go back

368
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
Now without

369
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Really severe distress

370
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,495
Is there really anything we can do in terms of

371
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
Staying ahead of hackers it seems like

372
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
Such a game of

373
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,079
LeapFrog

374
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
You know you got

375
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Two steps ahead and

376
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
LeapFrog you and then you

377
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Program in Saint sauveur

378
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,575
Yeah it is very difficult and I know that there are people who are working

379
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,391
To try to

380
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:56,255
Figure out ways to create identities that are less hackable

381
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
And

382
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,607
To protect against fraud now identity theft

383
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,887
Prodigy buried if

384
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Things

385
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,447
They're often

386
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,495
So confused for one another but for

387
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Pretending to be

388
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
He is different from say

389
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,639
Stealing my credit card number and using it to pay for something

390
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,479
You know that's not actually pretending to be me

391
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
That message

392
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
You know fraud and Theft

393
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,319
So

394
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
We have to address these thing

395
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
In different ways

396
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,511
With we have to address the issue of identity

397
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:31,583
And figuring out how to separate that for

398
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
From access

399
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
So that you will know that

400
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,423
If I need to give

401
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
My

402
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,031
Teenager access to my account that we can tell the difference

403
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Between us

404
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
You're not pretending to be me

405
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,383
They're at getting access

406
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,687
My resources with my permission

407
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,295
So we have to work on separating those and making those easier for consumers

408
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
To do

409
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
What did you first

410
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,391
See this as a major problem

411
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
You thought yourself

412
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
This is not going to work

413
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
Was there a moment back

414
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
Sandy 80s

415
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
We thought this

416
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,447
No I didn't think about in the 80s and in fact

417
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,983
Took me a long time as

418
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
Security professional

419
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
To understand the

420
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
Perspective of non-technical people

421
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
Would come

422
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,151
Complain and I'd say what

423
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:18,687
What's your problem

424
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
But

425
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
And you don't ask things

426
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,039
As things progress

427
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
And I started having

428
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
Try to manage

429
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Not just for myself

430
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,695
But for my parents were in

431
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Acetate

432
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,047
For my children who are still minors

433
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,863
Didn't know how to manage their own accounts yet

434
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
It multiplied so much that I finally

435
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Initiated what the problem

436
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
What would you say are

437
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
Some of the things of the most

438
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Horton saying

439
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
That

440
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
People listening to this

441
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Should take away

442
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
From you and turns

443
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
They're on Limited

444
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
The way that they keep their password

445
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
What they can do to

446
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
To further secure

447
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,063
Their own

448
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,879
Well one of the

449
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,463
The worst things I think we ever did as technology professional

450
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,767
To everybody else is said first of all

451
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
You have to memorize

452
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
These passwords

453
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
They all have to be

454
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,215
They have to be really complicated and you should never ever write them down

455
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
That that was just silly

456
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,079
Because nobody can hold that much in their head

457
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,407
It is perfectly okay to write something down

458
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
And

459
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
Secure it

460
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,527
The same way that you would you know your credit cards

461
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
Like if you have to write down a password

462
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Put it in your wallet

463
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
With your

464
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,487
Or keep it at home in a drawer because at this point

465
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,583
The danger of somebody breaking into your house and finding that book

466
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,631
Passwords is much smaller

467
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Then the danger of somebody

468
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:50,079
Going through and brute-forcing guessing passwords online

469
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
From a disc

470
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,199
So you are perfectly okay to be writing

471
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
Passwords down and keeping them at home

472
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,319
The other alternatives

473
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,367
Courses to use a password man

474
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,183
And that will get you a lot of the way

475
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
Towards

476
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
Securing those passwords

477
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
But also

478
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
You know use your influence

479
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
As a consumer

480
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
With

481
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,727
The different entities that you're doing business with and say

482
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,567
You know it is what they are asked

483
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,383
Love you is difficult you should push back

484
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
And say

485
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,735
I need an easier way to do this can't you set up a biometric

486
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
Can't you make this work with my password manager

487
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
Because

488
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
Consumers do deserve

489
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,671
An easier experience

490
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,975
When it comes to managing online access

491
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
And I mean just

492
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
Finding a way to

493
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,815
Do it where I don't

494
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Don't feel so sad

495
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
Stressed out about

496
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
When I changed

497
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,167
Phones for example

498
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,287
Coming to figure out how to get all my accounts on my it's almost like the biggest

499
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
The biggest hassle them all

500
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,407
Beyond

501
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,807
Yeah yeah it it it it kill most feel worse than getting hacked because you're just being frustrated everyday

502
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
Nothing to show for it

503
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
For coming on the show

504
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,887
Thank you very much for having me this week's episode was recorded and edited by Dean white produced by

505
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:24,287
Lorenzo franchetti BK and hosted by me you'll be hearing from us next week
