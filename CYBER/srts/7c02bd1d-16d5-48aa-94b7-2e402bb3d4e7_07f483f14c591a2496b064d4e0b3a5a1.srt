1
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
Virus

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Eagle One

3
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
The package being delivered some American politicians have been known to well

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:35,328
Not totally understand the internet sample who can forget when Republican senator Ted Stevens from Alaska

5
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:41,728
Famously said this in 2006 while debating against net neutrality

6
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,920
You know current president seems to rely on Aging stereotypes of

7
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320
What a hacker is supposed to be lots of other people could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400

8
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:01,440
It's okay that said there were few American politicians who know the internet

9
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,256
On this program we've had Senator Ron Wyden

10
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,304
Key for all intents and purposes

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,888
Is one of the biggest surveillance Hawks in the history of the US government

12
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:16,288
An issue after issue too many of the leaders in the intelligence Community have not

13
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:22,688
The Congress in the dark Congress has been given an inaccurate statements in effect and actively misled

14
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:27,296
But on this week's episode we're going to be sitting down with Dutch new member of Parliament

15
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,832
Beretta shotgun

16
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,160
She's well-known infosec Community as a politician

17
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,720
Who knows the ropes of cybersecurity in a way that

18
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,000
Beaufort colleagues do

19
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,560
In the past Chaka has been

20
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,424
And called on International laws governing the sale of cyber weapons

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
Government spyware

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
And exploit

23
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm done nakuu

24
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:54,944
So thanks for being here Marietta General wanted to talk about

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,760
Sort of the proliferation of spyware

26
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Nation-states

27
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
And how the

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Affected global politics and also

29
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Human rights but

30
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,928
You recently wrote an op-ed

31
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,976
About the regulation of government spyware

32
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
And I wanted to know

33
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
Being who you are and in your

34
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
Government

35
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,912
Why is it such an important

36
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:21,568
This has been a concern of mine for many many years and I've been pushing for changes in

37
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,616
The EU laws to make it more

38
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
Control

39
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,200
Who gets to buy

40
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
These you know

41
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
Police

42
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
Level

43
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,344
Hacking tracking tracing and surveillance tools

44
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
After looking closely at what happened

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
During the popular uprisings

46
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
North African and Middle East and how they were cracked out

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,816
Very clearly was not only

48
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Individuals

49
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:44,864
Students

50
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,144
Journalist

51
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
Human rights Defenders were empowered by the use of

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,032
Technology mobile phones and connecting and self-organizing

53
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Documents

54
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Human rights violation

55
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,360
But it was

56
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
Clearly also

57
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
Dictatorial regimes

58
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
Military Intelligence services

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
And their beliefs

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,528
That were using

61
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
New technologies

62
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
In ways

63
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
To repress

64
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
And the more I started following the thread of

65
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,488
What technologies these exactly were the more I

66
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
Trace them back

67
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
And

68
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
To democracy

69
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,912
And so I think it is an unacceptable boomerang

70
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
That has has allowed to

71
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
Continue

72
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
When

73
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,872
You made or us made or israeli-made Technologies are sold

74
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408
To repressive regimes

75
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
Clear violation

76
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,808
Septicology that NSO group it has developed on

77
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,856
Spell ceiling

78
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,672
Dictatorship States like Saudi Arabia

79
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,208
Is being used by Visa

80
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
States in order

81
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:48,352
Tattoo as spy after activists a4u merized journalist

82
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Like your message

83
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Specific

84
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
Marketplace

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
It's very much reflects sort of this

86
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Conventional Weapons

87
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
Industry

88
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
And you think

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
It means you think the two

90
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,688
Are the same word or two have a lot of

91
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,456
Similarities

92
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,552
Yeah I think they have in the sense that you always have the risk that win

93
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
Weapons or Technologies are

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
App record for

95
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
Controls

96
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,303
A rule of law Anchorage use like for example countering terrorism in a country like the Netherlands

97
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,887
Country where the rule of law certainty protects people and

98
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
Where are the thresholds for the use of

99
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Very invasive

100
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,239
Technologies is high

101
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:32,127
But if there's them proliferation and and the same technology turns up in in a handful of other locations then

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,407
Its fins out of

103
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
Control and that is a

104
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
The same with

105
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
Many examples that we've seen in the image

106
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,527
Traditional weapon ended

107
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
And what's interesting is that

108
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
Used to speak about digital arms

109
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,487
Ulta to make it clear to my colleagues who may not be working on technology on a daily basis

110
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
Do you know why this is

111
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Serious problem

112
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
And I got a lot of pushback especially

113
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,095
Savefrom

114
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
Human rights groups

115
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:59,263
She said you're militarizing the internet as Etc but I actually think that the mechanisms of proliferation

116
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
And the Harms

117
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Is caused by

118
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,151
These hiking and masturbating stools are actually very very

119
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
Comparable to the traditional arms in

120
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,807
I completely agree and I think it is difficult for p

121
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
People to

122
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
Stand that

123
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
These

124
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,671
Tools really do a navel

125
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,951
Militaristic

126
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Acts

127
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,303
Price same way an AK-47

128
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
Help

129
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Sight words

130
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,191
What helps repression you know it gives more power

131
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,263
To the kind of dictatorial Human Rights for press

132
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,335
Singers names that are already so powerful that they can silence

133
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,127
Descent and now they can do it in it

134
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:40,479
Near the invisible way I mean normally the world cries out when there is blood in the

135
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Sum when there is

136
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
Bullets fired and

137
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
You know when tanks roll

138
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
Roll on on public

139
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
Squares but here

140
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:52,255
The silencing and the tracking and the dragon people out of their homes

141
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,839
Listen to torture chambers and prison cells happens nearly invisible

142
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,423
And it sits on top of that enable by

143
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Western made

144
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
Technologies

145
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,079
So I think there could hardly be a clear case for the need to really rich

146
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
Prix fixe box

147
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
Citrate

148
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,199
When you look at something like the Boston or agreement of Mount Hope IMAX

149
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Pronounce this correctly

150
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
Actually. Tell me what is the Boston agreement how does

151
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
How does it affect

152
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
The spyware malware ended

153
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,047
So it is an agreement between a number of countries including the US a number of European countries of Russia in August

154
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
The broad set of countries in other words

155
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,167
That have agreed on certain list

156
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
That enter into

157
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
The force when there's like an embargo

158
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
So it's basically preselection of embargo

159
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Tools

160
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,127
And

161
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
There are some

162
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
Technologies in the Dual use category on

163
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
The Boston a list

164
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295
But certainly not all

165
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,135
Because of these business or breed once every couple of years and

166
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:57,535
I personally believe that's European countries do European Union because it is a democratic and it has high

167
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
Human rights standards

168
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Should go much

169
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
Further than busting our because the bus in our Arrangement is

170
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Originated in

171
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
Security concern

172
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,823
And the concerns that I believe we need to have our also very clearly human rights

173
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,431
So should there be something that's that's more expensive in terms of

174
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,223
Governing the trade

175
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,503
The Cyber weapons

176
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Trade

177
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
Should be International agreement

178
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
Well I mean what we've done here in the European Parliament is already gotten a majority behind what we

179
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
I believe the new EU standards

180
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
So

181
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
That means

182
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,375
One listing more Technologies as

183
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
Needing to

184
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,983
Obtain a license before export so you basically

185
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
Credit check

186
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
Before you know just allowing

187
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
Export to anyone

188
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
Who wants to purchase

189
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,967
And then secondly you assess whether there is human rights

190
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Concern

191
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,271
And we suggest

192
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,855
To do that on the basis of existing criteria existing combination

193
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,903
Human rights violations so that it doesn't have

194
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,463
How to become overly politicized and complicated

195
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,231
Would really

196
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,023
It'll when when certain condemnation

197
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,119
The violations of already happened then it automatically means that you cannot just

198
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
Self

199
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,935
As a letter Italian or French

200
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
Or a German company

201
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Systems

202
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
To the authorities in those,

203
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
And what we've also done

204
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,127
Is recommended that there was much

205
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
Stricter control of the end-user

206
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Because they're there seems

207
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
To be a lot of leeway

208
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,063
When you for example sell to the government

209
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Avocado

210
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,903
Maybe on paper

211
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
For countering terrorism

212
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
But it made

213
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,231
Practice Act

214
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
CB

215
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
2

216
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,327
You know find critical journalist

217
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
To track them

218
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,447
Let you know where they are to know who their networks are their sources are and then to

219
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
Use that information

220
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
Can against them

221
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
How to build a case

222
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,615
To torture them to accuse them etc etc so

223
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,431
We need much more clarity also on who

224
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Who gets

225
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
These Technologies

226
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
For what for

227
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
You take something like

228
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
The hacking humans

229
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,111
You know key years ago

230
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
Such a

231
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Story in that

232
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
We saw a company

233
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
The recruiting spyware and selling it

234
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,535
Repressive regimes

235
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,607
The software allows for hacking team to basically infected

236
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Infecting in the sense of

237
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
Put a virus on our on

238
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
Essentially have full access

239
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Bacon

240
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,591
Thanks I can download files

241
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
Like you like you said

242
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,271
The Technologies are are proliferating do you think that

243
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
There is

244
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
A hockey team in Europe

245
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,159
Right now that we don't even know about that is doing the sets of Faith released

246
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,207
I would bet a lot on that

247
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
I think that it's

248
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Completely in transfermarkt

249
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
That is now estimated in billions

250
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,863
Heroes of value

251
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,167
And a lot of these companies

252
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,471
Have no interested in having their reputation

253
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
Should know you know they go to trade fairs

254
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,591
They they deal in the dark corners of

255
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
States with with

256
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,711
You know track records of very

257
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,479
Repressive

258
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,271
Actions against

259
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
Human rights Defenders or dissidence

260
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
Opposition figure

261
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,719
So yeah I'm I'm sure that there's a lot we don't know yet and

262
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,511
I think transparency house

263
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
To be another Alamo

264
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,351
Because what we've also seen you mention hacking team win

265
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,143
Used to operate from Italy

266
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,447
There was also Aria Spa another

267
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,007
Italian bass company that that's old

268
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
To Syria

269
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:25,151
To the Assad regime when the crackdowns on the popular uprisings war well no

270
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:29,247
And you know it is not only the selling of Technology it's not like a box

271
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
Your ship from a distance

272
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
It often involves

273
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Consulting

274
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
Training

275
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
On-the-spot assistance

276
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
How these technology

277
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
Abused so

278
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
What we need

279
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Besides

280
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,815
A transparency on which companies are active on the market and selling what

281
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,631
To which buyers we also need much more

282
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
Accountability

283
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Avi export

284
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,703
Controls Authority

285
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,471
Because

286
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:53,311
Perhaps it's no coincidence Perhaps it is because of good journalism in Italy

287
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,079
But perhaps

288
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Subnautica

289
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
That there are a lot of

290
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Very active

291
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,967
Companies in the hacking and surveillance

292
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
Technologies in Italy

293
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,343
And that there have been a number of incidents on covered where they actually sold

294
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Despite sanctions

295
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,207
Two countries that were not even allowed to receive these

296
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,231
Technology so

297
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,583
The need for oversized and the need for transparency is very urgent

298
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,887
On the part of companies but also on the part of governor

299
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,959
What do you make a something like NSO group

300
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,031
Right now that's me that's been in the news for multiple reason

301
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
How come this this company is

302
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
Just been able to

303
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
Continue to behave in

304
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,991
Beatley improper ways and

305
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Yet

306
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
You have government still buying their stuff

307
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
So on the one hand

308
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
The problem is that our laws are lagging

309
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,159
Behind

310
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,439
So even though

311
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:43,999
You and I and many people hearing this my

312
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
Immediately agree that

313
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
You know to have a journalist

314
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,119
Triton Tracen later murdered

315
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,703
With the help of these Technologies is not a desirable out

316
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
It's also ironic I think that an Israeli company is

317
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,103
Is providing Arab dictators you know their so-called enemies

318
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
With with their weapons

319
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Choice

320
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:04,991
But the point is that even if we think it is

321
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,575
Unjust and fundamentally wrong

322
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,927
The laws do not forbid it that was so I think we need to step up the laws I would have liked to

323
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Seymour European leadership

324
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,231
In the parliament weave

325
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
We spelled out how we think

326
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,071
You know much better safeguard

327
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
Should work but the member State Governor

328
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
AR

329
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Very reluctant

330
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,263
That may also explain why this NSO group has been

331
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,567
Getting so much space I mean

332
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,639
I would be surprised if there aren't very good relations

333
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,431
Between the Israeli authorities and the

334
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
This company

335
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,015
Because I'm sure they would have landed in if they if they would have

336
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
Had concerns and

337
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
I believe

338
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
The company is now in

339
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
In the hands of

340
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
European investors

341
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,999
So I think we need we need to ask them to tough question

342
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,071
Sounds like what is going on are there no ethical

343
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,375
Benchmarks are there no limit

344
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
What's to the cynical sales of these

345
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
A tools that have

346
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
That have clearly

347
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,287
Let the way to the murder of a journalist

348
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,359
Forgive me for being pessimistic but it's also sort of this

349
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
This feeling that

350
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
You look at the top weapons

351
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
Stealing countries in the world and their all

352
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,015
Some of the most

353
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
Respected democracy

354
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,391
Where people have socialized Healthcare Etc

355
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,439
And their countries and yet

356
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Sweden

357
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Sell tons of weapon

358
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
Different countries

359
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,095
And the same sort of goes for

360
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
How we allowed this

361
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
Someone wants to make money off of

362
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
Cyber weapons or surveillance

363
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
Tools and

364
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Word

365
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:38,431
I think there's a couple of things that we may want to look at as well as one

366
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
That there's most likely

367
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,295
Even though this is obviously not discussed on the front pages of

368
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,343
Newspapers but there's probably

369
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Quite close relationship

370
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,903
Between the intelligence service

371
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
Is off some of these countries

372
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Is and

373
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:50,975
These companies

374
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,791
That may also enable in a other use

375
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Their Technologies once they're in the hands

376
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
I think that's an area

377
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,495
Scrutinize more I can't do that as a parliamentarian but I think during the

378
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
Smite or

379
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,591
Whistleblowers from these companies might I think that's

380
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
That's something that might explain

381
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
Why governments are so relaxed

382
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
So I think that's

383
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
The Death Clock

384
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,855
Simply Market power you know not to not to

385
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
Barriers up

386
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Against companies

387
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,463
Is it still an argument that

388
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,023
Also brought her business associations have you

389
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
I spoke to a number of

390
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,911
A business associations who were upset when we wanted to put

391
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
Stronger controls

392
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,959
Complacent

393
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
We're dealing with a very

394
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,799
Specific Niche this does not

395
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,335
These measures do not impact

396
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
You know the vast majority of

397
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,455
It is just about

398
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
Standing for

399
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
Principals at end end

400
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,599
They should have meaning and I fully agree that

401
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,927
The same lack of responsibility on the part of democracy

402
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,231
These can be seen when it comes to Conventional arms

403
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
And when it comes

404
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,839
New surveillance technologies that aren't by the way becoming faster

405
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Smaller and

406
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,375
Cheaper everyday

407
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,959
So you would say then you have this situation where

408
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,727
Intelligent agent

409
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
These are working

410
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Hand in hand

411
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Companies

412
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
To ostensibly

413
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
Cell

414
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
Surveillance tools

415
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
2

416
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
Regimes that they're trying to back

417
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,551
Well I don't know the details of the relation I think it deserves more

418
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:23,391
Investigation I don't think it is necessarily the ones they back maybe it's

419
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
The ones they wanted

420
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
Information on

421
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
I don't know exactly about the link

422
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
And thighs

423
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,071
Because I just don't have the overview a lot of this

424
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,631
Is anecdotal because we have no food transparent

425
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,935
Which is a problem in and of itself

426
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
But I do think it is

427
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,031
Curious that now

428
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,591
The member states of the European Union

429
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
Are not moving ahead with

430
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,735
Putting stricter rules in place even though there was a clear majority for it

431
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Is your pee

432
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
Can Parliament I work for

433
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
Security researchers

434
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
No making sure that's for example we would

435
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,903
Speak of exfiltration

436
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
So not

437
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,951
Natsu

438
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Put up

439
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Problems

440
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
For pentesters or

441
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
For you know

442
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,167
Good face hackers that are trying to help improve the cyber

443
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,191
Security of

444
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,799
Accompanies and then institutions but really to focus only on the illegitimate

445
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
An unauthorized

446
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,103
Accessing of

447
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Devices

448
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,455
And I'm taking out a data unknown

449
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
For example right so we

450
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
We worked with civil society

451
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
With Security Experts

452
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
Across party lines

453
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
The cross nationalities to get

454
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,695
Get to a better place

455
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
We suggest also

456
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
Judy list

457
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
Encryption technology

458
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
Another We're updating the Expo

459
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
For control list so I think it is really

460
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,799
Much more up-to-date but the governments of the EU member states are nothing but also I really hope that more journalists will look at why

461
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,847
Countries like Sweden

462
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,151
Finland Zara

463
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
No part of the majority that wants

464
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,967
See progress here

465
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
Seated scribe

466
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,039
The situation for your software

467
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087
You need to get some support

468
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,623
From the government and from

469
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,415
The EU Parliament but there was sort of this

470
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,463
Misunderstanding with some of your colleagues

471
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,255
Just fundamentally didn't understand

472
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,559
The way that the internet works I mean

473
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,863
You're leaving now the EU Parliament

474
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
If I'm

475
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
If I'm correct

476
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:15,519
Yes which is unfortunate I think you know you have the infosec community in ND

477
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
I mean

478
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,567
Citizens

479
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Of the Worlds

480
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,151
Who really need politicians who understand

481
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
The internet

482
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Because

483
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,247
Right now even to this day

484
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
In the United States around the world

485
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,367
Politician still fundamentally don't really understand

486
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
The internet

487
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Why do you think that is

488
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:37,535
Why I breathe very important to bridge the gap between the world of technology in the world of politics but it has to

489
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
A two-way street write a lot of Technology

490
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
Expert

491
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
Honestly do not understand government

492
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,287
Either so let's try to extend a hand both ways and I will be committed to

493
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,847
To Bridging the Gap and whatever else I

494
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
I will do next

495
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
And I'm confident that in the next

496
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
Class of members of Europe

497
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
Can Parliament there will be more tech-savvy

498
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:58,783
Members of Europe

499
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,575
Parliament's included because

500
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,671
Part of this is is a natural element of of

501
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,511
Apartments I mean I don't know so much about agriculture even though I do vote on it

502
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,071
And also you always have a division of labor

503
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
And on the other hand it's

504
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,911
Might be a little bit of a generational issue

505
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:18,751
That's just to keep up with all the latest Technologies

506
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,847
It's it's a bit of a challenge if you are further removed from their use

507
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
Or

508
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,943
But I agree it is very urgent

509
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
To have

510
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,319
Up-to-date knowledge before people start

511
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Proposing

512
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
Regulatory intervention

513
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,719
Search United States there's definitely this war on whistleblowers

514
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
That's been going on August

515
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
The Trump Administration is

516
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
This is gone after

517
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,071
Journalist

518
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,655
In any way that you know both Obama and

519
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
George W bush

520
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
Didn't do released

521
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:50,751
Extent of it

522
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
What do you think right now the situation with

523
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
Assange and

524
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
How

525
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Governments

526
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
Are starting to criminalize

527
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
Not only journalism but

528
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
Whistleblowing

529
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
Why I think whistleblowers needs

530
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,415
To be protected I believe press freedom is one of our greatest Goods in Europe

531
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,231
We have our own set of challenges all the

532
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,023
Asean countries like Hungary

533
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
Italy

534
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
You know where

535
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,631
There's a lot of pressure

536
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,959
Poland yearly weather rule of laws on

537
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
Under Pressure so

538
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
I think we have

539
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
To all be very veggie

540
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
To protect

541
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
Freedom of expression

542
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
The Press

543
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,711
Space for independent press also with a crowding-out

544
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
Of advertising

545
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
By the Big Tex Flats

546
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
So

547
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
The Whole Health

548
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Abdomen

549
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Percy and The credibility

550
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Of democracy

551
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
Globally very much

552
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Depends on

553
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
It's well being at home

554
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
And we have

555
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
We have works

556
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
Pharmacy you're on your way out

557
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,423
Government right now but where do you see sort of

558
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
Nation state hacking and

559
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Surveillance

560
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Generally

561
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Do you see this

562
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Adidas shoes

563
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,919
Getting better for the public or do you think we're kind of headed down a road that

564
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,711
That is not so good

565
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,807
I've been consistently surprised at how little attention

566
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,879
The commercial Market of surveying

567
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Barstools and

568
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,415
Fuse

569
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,207
Of these tools by government

570
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,559
And then the proliferation of these tools really actually gets so I'm very happy that you were

571
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Focusing on it in the

572
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
I see big

573
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
Ferredoxin

574
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
You know hypocrisies

575
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,495
Between

576
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,567
The outrage that I hear when another

577
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Inno setup

578
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:34,175
Steps by the Chinese authorities Visa V minorities were in the use of

579
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Facial recognition

580
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
Ocean Technology or

581
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,343
AI is being reported I mean we're clearly worried about the buildup of the survey and State

582
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,135
China I'm worried about the two

583
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,207
But I don't understand why there has been all the link back

584
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,303
To assess hey what are we doing here and you're up and why is our markets

585
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,863
You know nearly unregulated

586
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,655
Near the unregulated and

587
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
I also believe that those

588
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Stu

589
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,007
Phenomenon will come together because

590
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Imagine

591
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,103
Just imagine that other countries are going to

592
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,919
The more Innovative ketchup

593
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,735
With the levels of technological progress

594
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
And will be market leader soon

595
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
So let's say

596
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,135
American European Israeli companies may lose their Edge

597
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
And will lag behind

598
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:21,792
And let's imagine that our markets are going to be flooded with commercial spyware that's

599
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,352
You know Chinese authorities are going to sell to

600
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
Criminal networks or

601
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
A big Corporation

602
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,520
Other non-state actors who knows right I mean

603
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
We were done probably

604
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,336
Beat ourselves

605
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,176
Looking back why we did not put in place more

606
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:44,576
Control of this Market in the first place which would then give us a much stronger negotiating position internationally would make it much more credible

607
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
If we would halt

608
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,416
Search in Chinese technology if we would have began

609
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,184
To halt

610
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,208
Some of our own

611
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:55,072
One final question I have to ask because obviously you're you're a member of

612
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,096
EU Parliament

613
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
And it's

614
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
Serve the burning question surrounding

615
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
Do you and

616
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
The UK right now

617
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
How how is

618
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,312
Brexit going to affect

619
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
The internet in your

620
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,640
What is very much depends on what the

621
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,456
Brits are going to do at the end of the day because

622
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,736
Clearly

623
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:17,600
There's a large group of people in the UK that believes that the country can compete better

624
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:21,184
On different standards and different criteria so let's imagine

625
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
That they would lower a data protection

626
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,096
And all kinds of data related

627
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,632
Standards right if they would you

628
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,680
Start of a race to the bottom

629
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
Then you can have an impact

630
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
But my sense is that

631
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,312
Contrary to all the political one-liners that you

632
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
You here

633
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,664
Relation between

634
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
The British

635
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
European markets

636
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
The dependents

637
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,600
Since therefore of the UK on EU standards is so

638
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
That it was

639
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
To be very difficult for them to Simply

640
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,768
Pick and choose and

641
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
Have other standard because they may gain

642
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
Some trade with

643
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,168
With third countries but they would lose

644
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,728
Compliance and alignment with your

645
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,752
Key market so

646
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
I hope

647
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
That the shocker

648
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
Effect will be minimal

649
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
But I could imagine

650
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
Choices will be made which would

651
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
Include lower standards and

652
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,248
It'll perhaps they want to become

653
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,320
The hub for commercial spyware who knows

654
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,856
I have not heard that tape

655
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,392
Before that it's possible that brick

656
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Could be

657
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,976
They could be the commercial spyware hub

658
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,560
Well I don't know either I hope not of course but

659
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
You never know I mean something

660
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,752
Something will probably change if they want to have a new Competitive Edge and there have been speculations it also

661
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
Much depends on which government

662
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
Are going to be in power

663
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,664
You know that they may lower the center for data protection

664
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,688
And then

665
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,248
Who knows what that would lead to

666
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:55,648
Right well thanks very much for coming on the show and we will continue to look at the car

667
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,696
Commercial spyware industry around the world and

668
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:04,096
It's unfortunate that you're leaving the EU Parliament but I'm sure you're on to great things as well thank you very much

669
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:10,496
And enjoyed discussing is very important topic with you thanks so much have a good day

670
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,896
Today's episode was recorded by Dean White

671
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,176
Francesca Pizzeria

672
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:22,016
And of course posted by me that neck
