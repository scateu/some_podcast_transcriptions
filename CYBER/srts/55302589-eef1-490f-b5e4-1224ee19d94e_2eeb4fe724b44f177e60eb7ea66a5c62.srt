00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Eagle One

00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Package being delivered next to the best iPhone hackers in the world

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:33,024
That's the question hundreds of people watching him we're all wondering

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,424
Bueno just one thing before thing thinks the white elephant in the room exact

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,192
Did we get it

7
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,216
Well

8
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
Could ask us next time we talk

9
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:53,248
Smile as you wrapped up one of the most anticipated talks at the black hat security conference in Las Vegas

10
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:58,112
In August of 2016 in attendance

11
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:03,488
Researchers from a company that sells iPhone crack and services to Cops around the world

12
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,304
Packers and apples own employees

13
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,960
Soilmec had dumped explored the secure Enclave processor one of the most closely guarded secret app

14
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
Apple encryption

15
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
On the iPhone

16
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,336
No nose how we did it

17
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,664
Motherboard senior staff writer Lorenzo franceschi because

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,968
I spent the last few months solving a mystery

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
And in doing so he stumbled upon a hush-hush iPhone

20
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:32,160
It's become one of the most important rules in the multimillion-dollar iPhone hacking industry

21
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,000
This week I'm talking to Lorenzo about his investigation

22
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,560
We've also scored an interview with a dealer

23
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,888
Clandestinely sells prototype and rare iPhones

24
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
On Twitter

25
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,984
I've been a coup in this is cyber

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
Lorenzo

27
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,432
Breaking the iPhones and Apple products

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Not very easy

29
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,320
Yeah used to be easy but we're talking about 10 years ago or more

30
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
These days breaking into an iPhone

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,440
May actually be the hardest thing you can do as a hacker

32
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,304
Almost everyone agrees that the iPhone is the most secure computer on Earth

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
It's the most secure

34
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,144
Yeah I mean the most security can get your hands on

35
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,192
Because I don't like back in the old

36
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
Hacker scene

37
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,520
Like jailbreaking an iPhone

38
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
Big deal

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
Like you're basically

40
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Human walking across

41
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,664
You know the infosec community

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,944
What was that guy's name

43
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
The kid who broke it

44
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,552
Gmod I interviewed him

45
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,624
Yeah I used to be that people would just like post

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,648
Get out there

47
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
Bedazzle

48
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,000
Be dozens house hacking iPhones on Twitter or YouTube

49
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
And brag about it

50
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
These days people don't do that and it's all because

51
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,888
Not only because it's harder

52
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,192
But also because

53
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,008
The Diwali of that is so high

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,848
UW just don't give it away on Twitter or YouTube

55
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
Let's look at something like vulnerabilities and the the price for is your day on the black market Iran

56
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
The open market

57
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
Very high for iPhone

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
So

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
What is this winter Jack was talking about like millions of dollars millions of dollars

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,048
Crowd fans and stuff like that

61
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
They offer literally like three four million dollars 2 million 1 million depending on exactly what vulnerability is bad

62
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
We're talking about

63
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
Yes at least six figures

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
In some cases

65
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
7 figures

66
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
Which leads us to

67
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,128
Your latest story

68
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
Which is to say

69
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
Maybe it's not so hard after

70
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:38,112
Yeah I still hard but one of the things that make iPhones really hard to hack

71
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
Is that they're basically

72
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
They're almost Black Box

73
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Price

74
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
You cannot

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Just connect your iPhone to your computer and start like

76
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,656
Going through the file system read the kernel or whatever

77
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,936
I guess is not bought

78
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,544
And that's because apple does not want you to do it because one of the

79
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,080
Strategies that apple

80
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,992
Employees to make it to you know make their phones more secure is to keep the to make them very obscure

81
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,064
It's what's called a security biopsy

82
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
Security

83
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,368
A lot of iOS

84
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:16,256
Is impossible to read as a user at Seminole just found an iPhone and connect to the computer

85
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,631
So what we found is that there are special iPhones if you will

86
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,727
Some people call them prototypes some people call them development iPhones

87
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,847
The more Technical and probably accurate way to call them is a fused iPhones

88
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,175
These are iPhones that have security features

89
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
Either turned off or that you can turn off

90
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
So

91
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,343
Assault describe them as a pre jailbroken iPhones

92
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,671
Play centuries are iPhones with fewer security

93
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
Measures enabled

94
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
So if you're somebody researching

95
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
And iPhone

96
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
Din tai fung researcher

97
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,167
Going through this phone and finding vulnerabilities on it

98
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,727
Far easier than if you were to have

99
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,055
An actual just off the market off the shelf

100
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
IPhone yeah I mean it's still complicated is still something and not everyone can do and like you know you still need to know what you're doing

101
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,783
But essentially the barriers of Entry are lowered

102
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
You know it's like

103
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343
Breaking into a house

104
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
Where the

105
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
Lock is already like

106
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,695
And I'm broken or something like that

107
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,279
That's a terrible metaphor

108
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
Yeah I mean it's nothing infosec

109
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:30,239
Yeah I mean you still need to do the work and you still need to find an ability you know exploited and whatever

110
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,079
I cannot see buddy that is the first time that that allows you to

111
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
You have a head start

112
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
It's a little easier than it is

113
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,199
If someone just sends you an iPhone

114
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
But now

115
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Who has Beast

116
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:47,135
So far as we can tell everyone who does security search on iPhone

117
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Asda

118
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
But this includes also some very

119
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
It's very almost in city of companies that

120
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,815
We've reported on

121
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:55,839
That also

122
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,191
You know use this information maybe for the dark arts of infosec versus

123
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,519
According to our sources companies like cellebrite

124
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,079
Have them and abused them in the past

125
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:14,015
These companies don't like to talk about this security researchers don't like to talk about this like the sources that we have in the story are most

126
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:14,783
What's the anonymous

127
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,855
FR multiple reasons but also because

128
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,647
It's kind of a

129
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:21,439
Open Secret in that community

130
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,791
So people who hack iPhone for living know that these devices exist

131
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,839
They know that their friends have them

132
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,119
They seen them

133
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,935
But they don't like to talk about it in public

134
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Because

135
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
First of all

136
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
It's unclear

137
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
If it's legal to

138
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
Even have them

139
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,383
Because

140
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,503
These phones essentially the or the way that my sources have described it

141
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
The fall of tracks

142
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
Or they like Escape

143
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Shenzhen

144
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
So someone in China is like

145
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:57,023
Taking these phones and getting in getting them on this underground grey market

146
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,327
And selling them to celebrate

147
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,351
Companies like

148
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
Potentially NSO group correct

149
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
Maybe

150
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,287
We don't know about any self example celebrate we're pretty confident

151
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,615
What kind of companies are celebrating NSO group what do they do

152
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:18,015
Yeah these are companies that essentially their whole business is hacking iPhones or providing tools to hack

153
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,623
Do iPhones or remind the kids of satellite they also do Android hacking and stuff like that

154
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:29,023
But these companies don't just do that they also support some pretty brutal regimes they sell these tools to whoever pays

155
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
So we're talkin about

156
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:36,447
You know celebrate used to have a male celebrities rumored to be the company that broke into the

157
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,751
Some of the famous San Bernardino iPhone

158
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:45,151
Where if you remember the FBI wanted to read the date on inside of this locked phone

159
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,479
I belong to the terrorist to kill the

160
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,551
2000 people in San Bernardino in that 70

161
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
So these are companies like we're talking about the the other company that was named in the store is called coralium

162
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:04,351
They're not as well-known as cellebrite and they're not exactly and and iPhone hacking company what they do is

163
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:10,495
They provide a platform where you can emulate iOS on a computer

164
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
So you essentially connect to

165
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,871
Grantland.com if you have an account there pretty expensive

166
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:22,527
But and then you can just create virtual Machines of iOS which until now and they're the first

167
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,831
Odoo it was impossible

168
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
It was impossible because apple as

169
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,951
Specifically designed the iPhone to make that almost

170
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:37,375
So coralium is used by people such as a security which is a company we wrote about last year does it cost

171
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Can I profile them

172
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,567
And what is asthma security vulnerabilities into Android iPhone

173
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,639
Homes and then sell those tools and tell those vulnerabilities

174
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
Governments around the world

175
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
What kind of government

176
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,759
In the case of Azimuth were talking about five eyes

177
00:08:54,271 --> 00:09:00,415
So NSA CIA FBI MI6 and MI5

178
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,511
Responding agencies in Canada and Australia

179
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,327
But yeah they're like Anna so essentially there

180
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
During that business

181
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
They are selling things to government

182
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:17,311
Define vulnerabilities and instead of reporting reporting them to the companies where they found a polyp in

183
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
They sell them to government

184
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,407
So that you can use them to hack people

185
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,223
And I guess that's the thing to about something like this

186
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,551
When companies that typically make money

187
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,831
Selling

188
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,903
Ways of breaking consumer goods

189
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,695
Like the iPhone

190
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
I'm not reporting them to Apple

191
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
But rather

192
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,303
Using them to sell

193
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
The government set a reviews than four

194
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,655
We can only imagine what reasons

195
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,727
This presents a pretty big problem to Apple

196
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
That that sells itself

197
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,799
Asbestos

198
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
Security by obscurity

199
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
We're better than Android Androids buggy

200
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,967
It's insecure don't use it where the best

201
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:00,063
Cuz that is essentially just undermines I have this whole Underground Market that

202
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Has

203
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:07,743
Basically call Bush on that has long touted the security of its products

204
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,143
As a marketing tool you don't like I mean they've used this literally as marketing you know years ago it was those famous ads

205
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
Where do you know the younger looking guy was making fun of the older looking guy was like supposed to be windows

206
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,383
And it was like oh you have viruses I don't you know cuz I'm a Mac

207
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:31,295
You know more recently at CES this year Apple put up like a giant

208
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,623
Adding Las Vegas saying what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone

209
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,743
Basically saying you know we respect your privacy but also our phones are more secure than Android

210
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
I know they are like they still are

211
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,375
I mean we could probably the Bates weather

212
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
A Google pixel is

213
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
Almost as secure as an iPhone

214
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
The point is that you said

215
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,847
There is a growing industry whose job is to hack into iPhone

216
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,431
And it is fueled by these devices at least in part

217
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,735
Are you part of the suit for me is like

218
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
It's typical

219
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,039
Hacker

220
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
Behavior to its

221
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
You tell them you can't hack something is

222
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Scared for you it's

223
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
Difficult to get into

224
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,487
And then suddenly now you have this

225
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,535
Group of very intelligent

226
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
Possibly nefarious

227
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Minded people

228
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
Court and 10th

229
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
I'm breaking into the iPhone

230
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
And they

231
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
Sounds like

232
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
They will do everything they can to do it

233
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:30,943
And some of these people may be the same ones who apple is invited to the

234
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,223
Bug Bounty programs

235
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,783
Which is not going very well as the reporter in the past

236
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,903
And this was Apple's just to remind your audience Like in 2016

237
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,559
Apple launch the ID IOS bug bounty program essentially asking the iPhone researchers independent

238
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
Independent iPhone researchers

239
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,679
To reach out to Apple and Report bags that they found

240
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,751
So that they would be rewarded with

241
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,103
Pretty good rewards and I were talking about off 220 and $50,000

242
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,639
And the

243
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
For around a year

244
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
Program basically

245
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
Did not gather any reports

246
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
As far as we could tell

247
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
Because no one wanted to

248
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,927
No one wanted to record this box because they're not that

249
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,207
Cheap

250
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,999
Essentially what what apple is

251
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
Offering is too long

252
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,887
Or what you can actually get in the tub multibillion-dollar

253
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,679
Apple which I think is it is

254
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
One of the most

255
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,591
I think it is the most profitable businesses in all of America and all the world

256
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Is getting peanuts for these

257
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
These mess up

258
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:40,063
Xiamen Peanuts movie is not the right word for you

259
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
Elsewhere

260
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Money Talks

261
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,975
I mean it goes back to like her who pays more and

262
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,303
Yeah what are your priorities the only feeling iPhone researcher

263
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,167
Do you want to give the back to Apple and get like you know a tenth of what you could get

264
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
If you give it to

265
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
Cellebrite Lawrenceville or

266
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
The roadium

267
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
I know you know

268
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,311
Some people

269
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,871
Will tell you that they prefer to get paid less

270
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,151
And reported to Apple

271
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:11,295
Some people will tell you well you know I'm going to get paid more and I'm going to go help the good guys

272
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
Aunt Paris and bad guys

273
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
Detective companies that say

274
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
Did you list we can have the terrorists

275
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,487
We all know just like weapons companies

276
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,535
They use the same sort of subjects

277
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,607
And it's quite often not quite true

278
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,399
Cuz we don't love these different types of

279
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,471
Organizations are described are also in touch with

280
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,799
Repressive regimes that use it to track journalist or activist

281
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,127
So when Apple's n

282
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,479
Advertises itself as the most secure platform if your

283
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
If you're going to buy a cell phone you have to buy cell phone that is but

284
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,319
If you're going to

285
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,343
Goldust

286
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,879
I mean

287
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
This really blows kind of the cover off of

288
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
Maybe it's not and

289
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
It's certainly

290
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
You know

291
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
The Apple Store

292
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
That seems to be sort of this church

293
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
Of Secrets

294
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
Stand power

295
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
Is not so powerful as we think it is

296
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
Definitely I mean like let's put it another way like if I'm an iPhone hacker or someone work

297
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
Which of these companies

298
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,271
And I and you know my living is finding his own abilities

299
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:17,855
Or I want to find and I want to hack a iPhone for whatever reason

300
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,647
I can just go on Twitter

301
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
And their sellers like we

302
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:28,607
Like we talked to three different sellers will advertise this device has openly on Twitter you found one of these

303
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:33,727
The other three of them actually so

304
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
It's not that hard to find you know like if your

305
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,127
If you know where to look and we're talking about twitter.com we're not talking about some

306
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:46,527
Obscure website dollartree.com Auntie Moyer on the Tor Browser

307
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
People are already are if you do this work

308
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:55,487
And then you can just DM these people maybe they'll ask you to like talk another Channel at some point but

309
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,559
Essentially you DM on Twitter and you say I want one of these

310
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
And they tell you okay

311
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,631
It's $5,000

312
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
You give them $5,000

313
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,727
And a couple days later you got it in the mail

314
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
And you can start packing I

315
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
Yeah if you know what you doing

316
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,175
Yeah and that you also need a special cable which these guys also provide but

317
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
That's like the cheapest paying like it's $500 for the cable

318
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
You know that that is not the problem

319
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
So

320
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,111
Again all you need to do

321
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,391
Talk to other guys

322
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,183
Get the device and start hacking

323
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,255
The question is does Apple have any idea about this

324
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:33,631
Apple knows about this as far as we know they did not talk to us for the story but

325
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:38,239
We know that they they are aware of the fact that there are some of these devices out there

326
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,055
And we also know that they're trying to climb down on it

327
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,383
How they're going to do it it's unclear and also

328
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,479
Is it even possible it's also unclear because again the problem is that

329
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
Apple produces millions of iPhones in China

330
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
It's impossible track all of them

331
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:57,695
And it's impossible to keep tabs on every employee who walks into Shenzhen

332
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
So

333
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,047
Take this device has somehow escaped

334
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
As as my sources of put it

335
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,167
Escape the factories and they found their way on Twitter

336
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,263
Can apple actually track them down take them all down

337
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
We probably not know it's just a

338
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:16,639
Epic scale problem the others too many iPhones are there

339
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,663
And

340
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
It's just impossible to keep track of them

341
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
But they also want you to think that

342
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
Their phones are easy

343
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:29,183
Easily the most secure phones out there and there's almost no way of breaking into them cuz even the FBI will have to

344
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,023
Ask for permission from Apple to get access

345
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,423
Yeah I mean what apple is doing this probably not I mean obviously they're trying to stop this flow over

346
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
That fuse devices on the market

347
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,519
But what they're also trying to do is

348
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:47,871
Make the iPhone just harder to hack so that even if you have one of these devices

349
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,527
You still you're still going to struggle so you know they're improving the security of the device itself that I'm improving

350
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,623
The security of the processor that improving the security of like the hardware itself

351
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
Are making the hardware like

352
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,743
Even harder to analyze and even if you get a knife when you open it up

353
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:09,887
You can just connect to we know the processor or RAM and like start analyzing it

354
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:15,263
So every year they try to make it harder and harder and they don't without relying on

355
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,823
The security of the supply chain which clearly

356
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,383
It's not that secure because this all ends again

357
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,663
You can just buy them

358
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,759
And as long as you have 5,000 15,000 $5,000

359
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,039
Whatever they ask you

360
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
You can find them

361
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:31,647
Which can be pretty profitable if you're somebody looking to

362
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Turn that

363
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,719
5 $20,000 into

364
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:38,047
Mp3million for vulnerability that you sell to somebody

365
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,887
Yeah yeah exactly I mean $20,000 for someone who's going to sell

366
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,167
The product of that work

367
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,215
Or like a million it snow

368
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
If that is kind of peanuts right

369
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
That is not that much

370
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,847
So you've arranged for us to actually

371
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
Meet one of these

372
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
These

373
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
These dealers

374
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
Cancel one of them lives in New York

375
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
And he's actually going to be on the show

376
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,535
Okay so

377
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
Why don't you tell me

378
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
What do you do what brought you here today

379
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
Security research

380
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Shandong

381
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,263
Lot of Apple journalist

382
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
Security research is that what you call it

383
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
But as I understand it

384
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
You get

385
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
I mean you get used sexually

386
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,223
Jailbroken

387
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,575
I grant you a break free jailbroken iPhone to say like

388
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,135
Apple's very secretive about the way that they keep

389
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,695
Their security very tight around their products

390
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,231
Able to get some of these

391
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Tobocman

392
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
Like

393
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,583
Device that Engineers use

394
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Or

395
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,423
Factory use for testing

396
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,495
And you can use those device that you have a lot of like

397
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
Sports that's not normally open

398
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Now you can do

399
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,615
Do a lot of cool stuff

400
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
Which you can find vulnerability

401
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:01,759
Yes it is finding vulnerabilities and iPhones as you know as a security researcher

402
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
Very very difficult

403
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,647
And those ass is mine you know iOS is pretty much like

404
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,415
Epoxy

405
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Reach

406
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
And dos

407
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
Opening like those

408
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Quartz

409
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
Is pretty much the

410
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
The Portugal in May

411
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:17,887
They got louder

412
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
You can dump the entire file system out

413
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
You can find

414
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,311
Jessie all the clothes and everything is compiled but you know

415
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
You still can find

416
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
So

417
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
Okay

418
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
How do you get this device

419
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,783
Connection with flight

420
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,063
People work for

421
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Accompany

And also

423
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,415
You get more time to China

424
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,439
Fun Factory

425
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
Dumb Junction Heights

426
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,095
We have a Ops Team

427
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
Pretty much they do a lot of development

428
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
Like the dybala

429
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055

00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,319
Okay so you get these devices from these people at mean is this at all legal

435
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,647
I mean for those I don't know how they got out but

436
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:12,671

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,519
Pre-production just to make sure like they are the manufactured

445
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
It's good that you go before you know

Yeah but then you get them though I buy them

463
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:07,711
You buy them from those from those people and then you sell them for how much

I don't know probably like

472
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,616
It depends on the device if it's like a DVT or like

473
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,968
Engineering validation like that that that CVT

474
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
You got

475
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576

Yeah we'll cuz they're buying and if we're going to look at sort of the history of Chinese

494
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,936
Text companies quite often they rip from American companies

495
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,240

Dropil or utility to release

499
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,968
I don't know release like a jailbreak like

500
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,736
Pretty much

501
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
To the public

502
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,552
So do you think I mean

503
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,648
Should I question for you do you think something like the Chinese government Chinese intelligence

504
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,304
Mickey size in 2016 things because they'd like to be able to break them when they have to I'm not sure

505
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,096
Government but I'm sure the scump

506
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,680
Maybe definitely do you know what the companies are doing that means the government are doing it

507
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,032
Yeah I'm not sure but you know maybe

508
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,872
You know Huawei those kind of like Huawei

509
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,896

00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Audible

511
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,480
But all those kind of companies are there buying like

512
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,320
Ambient reverse engineering those sites Hardware as walking out

513
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
You know what happened

514
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:28,256
When do you know when iPhone 10 come out camera and two lanes and their vertigo

515
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
And

516
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:32,352
When iPhone 7 come out the all dual

517
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,632
Horizontal cameras

518
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,704
Those people those company

519
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,776
Why those prototypes and then you know the

520
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
Pretty much

521
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,384
Just recreate themselves because you know people want

522
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
Stuff that's closing Oaks

523
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:49,760
I mean stuff over here like I phone bill cost around like

524
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
Hundred dollars

525
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,344
What are you trying to

526
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
It's like

527
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160
6000

528
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,440
8000

529
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
And again we just people antenna

530
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
Fortunate people want something similar

531
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
But wait for tomorrow

532
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:09,984
And in order to do that before or a little bit right after Apple release a new device

533
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,520
I have to get their hands on you know

534
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:19,200
Do you have any idea how much this would piss off Apple sending you were doing that I mean absolutely yes

535
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:25,600
Infuriate them are you worried about ever getting any legal repercussions because of this because they've got a big legal

536
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,160
I got a lot of money to throw people but I'm not

537
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,696
I'm not

538
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,280
The person who did this I'm not a person who getting them

539
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,632
And I'm not a person who do the vulnerability I'm not a person who hurt their business

540
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
I'm just

541
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,936
Research

542
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
Wanda

543
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:46,080
And you sell them off like you you advertise on Twitter do you know

544
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,408
Some predator on eBay used to but you know

545
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Apple is getting

546
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,016
Sirius on

547
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
EBay dolls Amazon

548
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
So you know deep deep and people

549
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,160
You still can fly

550
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:05,280
A short amount of time that people who sell listing I bet there's a decent on people food

551
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,840
Other handsome photo guy device or like

552
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,120
Pre-production device

553
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,472
But you know more likely people sell them

554
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
Like to solve

555
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
Server order

556
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
Collection

557
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,176
When you see apple advertising itself as the most secure

558
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,712
Device

559
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,808
Company that creates lots of the iPhone or

560
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,088
You know MacBooks

561
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,416
Being the most secure versus Android or PCR

562
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,512
Deep but you still think it's kind of b******* the fact that you're able to find these devices and

563
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,584
And find vulnerabilities and sell these phones to people who

564
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,912
Then we'll do the exact same it is not because you know

565
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
4liker

566
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,216
Production device

567
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
For like a release device

568
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,824
You actually cannot do anything

569
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,872
All the ports of logs

570
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
That means you can

571
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,224
Funny Bone ability and also those device came with

572
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
Dupree like

573
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:03,904
Pre-release version of the iOS so it lets us a iPhone D20 prototype for the pointy

574
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
Is

575
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
Pretty much iPhone

576
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
8

577
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,256
Whatever the farmer came

578
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,864
Before release is what exactly you know when device came out release

579
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
People have to

580
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,472
Spend time to find out availability

581
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,544
Apple just push more firmware updates

582
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Then

583
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,152
So

584
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,456
The only thing that people want

585
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:32,320
Like security research rice Ace Hardware vulnerability and they seemed very rare

586
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Are you see those

587
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
Hargrove on like that

588
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
Psiphon for iPhone

589
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
Freaky eyes

590
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
Bootrom exploit

591
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,304
There's naturally no way to fix it

592
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,608
Unless you release a new

593
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,216
But you know those things became very very hard to find

594
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
And they're getting very good like

595
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
Apple have their own

596
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
Swd table

597
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Like

598
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,408
Software development table.

599
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
Those special cables

600
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,736
Special software

601
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
They're getting

602
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,808
Very smart and the

603
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:08,160
Use like server-based even if you have the stolen Hardware

604
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,488
Or like the hardware store you are not supposed to get

605
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
You still work

606
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,816
Don't be able to do a lot

607
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,912
Because a lot of things require a server Authentication

608
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
Required accountant

609
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
She don't feel like what you're doing is

610
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,336
Is hurting Apple new devices

611
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,360
It's not

612
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
But you know

613
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,688
You can if you want to but

614
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,968
I don't want to

615
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
Stuff like that

616
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
What about the people you sell these devices

617
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
It depends on

618
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,880
Weather

619
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,952
I mean that sounds a little bit like you know I'm going to

620
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:48,352
Yeah I guess some people from fentanyl unlike what they do with it what they do with it you know they could like

621
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,168
I'm not doing it for profit or

622
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,448
Something like

623
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,008
Find vulnerabilities not for me

624
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
Threatening

625
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
Apple or anything like that

626
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:59,104
But you know it's always hard to get a

627
00:27:59,360 --> 00:27:59,872
Piece of

628
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
Divisive

629
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,736
Piece of things that you would not normally be able to get in the morgue

630
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:06,784
Collector

631
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,856
So it is interesting to sort of for you to do

632
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,416
Put these out there at the stuff that

633
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,488
Go to the break at 2

634
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,560
Which is this classic handkerchief

635
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
Exactly what it

636
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,912
And these devices are widespread across the end

637
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:27,520
Some of them are more rare than the others

638
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,800
Gbtc

639
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,872
The last stage is it's a lot you know

640
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:35,968
Did you get your hands on one side

641
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,624
Well yeah you can find

642
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
And all

643
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,000
You know a lot of even high school kids

644
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,304
Interior very affordable

645
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,096
They're pretty much

646
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,888
Close to the retail

647
00:28:55,168 --> 00:29:01,312
Has Apple ever contacted you personally to tell you to stop doing this no but their lawyer did took down my listing

648
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,360
That's it

649
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
See that you're literally not afraid of that s*** at all you're not afraid to get

650
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
Do it

651
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
And I'm not

652
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Fronting the money

653
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Right

654
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
I'm literally just collector

655
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
And summer collection

656
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
A better way to look at it

657
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,584
So what which ones have you sold reason

658
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
Which iPhone

659
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,192
The recent one is sold at Yuan

660
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
Person Florida

661
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,008
It's very famous

662
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
Like

663
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
Running iOS

664
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
Illinois no wise device

665
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,992
I'm pretty much like a virtual machine that runs iOS

666
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
One of the r

667
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
It's pretty much like a

668
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:46,880
BBT

669
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:51,232
But it's before that it doesn't have a very very

670
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
Industrial look

671
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,352
Enclosure it's not a regular enclosure I so that

672
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:58,144
Northside store

673
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,168
The Peabody Opera

674
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
To some collector

675
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
How many busy cell year

676
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,360
Like 20-30 of those

677
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,152
Depends on people

678
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
Really like depends on

679
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,784
Can you have an in in China

680
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Buckets

681
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,856
Devices

682
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
The device and dumb

683
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,696
The either ship to them directly

684
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Or should I

685
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:26,560
To me directly and not use those like profits you feel myself

686
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
2

687
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,864
Get my hands on

688
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
Verix

689
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,240
It's almost like

690
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
Apple screwed up by sending Albans

691
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,568
Device

692
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Manufacturing to China

693
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:45,248
Because now yeah you know insecurities are coming out of it because Factory workers

694
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,016
They're not

695
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,808
Airline employee

696
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,392
Carryover by

697
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
Prophet

698
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,256
So yeah those people ready you know hate their jobs

699
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:01,120
And now they're trying to make a little little bit more cash bite you know

700
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,656
Game of survival

701
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
Which

702
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,240
What do you call yourself by the way

703
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Online

704
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,056
Online

705
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
On my Twitter is like

706
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,128
Pretty names like

707
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
Apple internal

708
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
Score

709
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
Pretty much

710
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,992
Apple internal store

711
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,040
Almost like you're actually part of Apple

712
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,880
Right but Apple internal is actually a apple

713
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:26,976
Internal it is is that is a term that he called but you know

714
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:31,584
The store is busy they selling those devices or selling stuff like that

715
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:38,752
And there is also somebody named like a Point journal app store their busy side of Wonder Labs

716
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:46,432
The prayer for me I'm some Harper Vision me this week's episode

717
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
