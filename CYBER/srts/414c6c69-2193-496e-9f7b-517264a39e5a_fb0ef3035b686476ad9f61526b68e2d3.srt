1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Eagle One

2
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Package being delivered

3
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:35,328
National Security reporter with Vice and this is cyber a podcast for motherboard about hacking

4
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:41,728
Yet again

5
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:48,128
There is stall over the place how did this happen I mean did this just jump off of a truck somewhere or

6
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,944
Is this

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,344
It's almost Christmas which means Nintendo fans are anxiously awaiting the December 7th release of Super Smash Bro

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,112
Brothers ultimate

9
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,416
The company's biggest game in years

10
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,000
But earlier this week the gaming World got some unexpected news

11
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,560
Pirates at the full copies

12
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,144
The game online weeks before anyone was supposed to get their hands on it

13
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,216
The week was one of the worst Nintendo's history

14
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,312
Can a company quickly begins lying to get copies of the fighting game taken offline

15
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
But the damage was done

16
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
Super Smash Brothers leak is spread far and wide thanks with small group of hackers on a piracy server called

17
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Xanax

18
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,112
Nintendo switch all about dropping games early

19
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,976
Motherboard senior staff writer Joseph Cox recently embedded in the switch piracy community

20
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,256
P****** games are leak

21
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,304
We found was much crazier

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,864
Reminiscent of the early days of hacking turf wars

23
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,056
Some people in the Nintendo gaming community

24
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,336
Weak games

25
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:56,736
I mean they're basically two ways the first one is pretty standard where

26
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:02,368
If you're in America and the game is coming out a day or two earlier you get someone in Australia to buy us and they'll dump it

27
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
The Conch Richmond

28
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
Interesting

29
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,024
Is when people will download the game from Nintendo servers

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
Beijing Kryptonite points in the complex

31
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
Solo ReliOn

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,632
Journalists

33
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
Games reviews

34
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
YouTube is

35
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,008
Diesels of people that Nintendo is trusted

36
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544
Review copies of the game

37
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104
To Dentistry the code to unlock it that way

38
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
There's a big overlap

39
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
Between

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,968
Religion list in the YouTubers on the review is

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,504
And the piracy

42
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,808
A community as well that definitely don't mean

43
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
Okay if it turns out that some people

44
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,464
Are actually pretty toxic and going after each other using hacking

45
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Yes

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,864
Community you think will be lovely innocent with Mario and Zelda from whatever maybe

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,656
There are parts of it that will

48
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
Package of a

49
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,544
Doxy Choppers and publish information online and just generally really screw

50
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
Isha price

51
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
Like if they have

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
Some sort of rivalry

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,408
The really going to act

54
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
Give me example of this happen

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
Between

56
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Packers

57
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
Nintendo game in space going

58
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,880
One case was a Geico

59
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,672
Put Simon he makes a

60
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,256
Tool which lets your PC talk to Nintendo says when you could

61
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,560
Download games okay game updates

62
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
It can also be used for piracy though

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
And try to get games earlier

64
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
Someone on full-time and I'm ready

65
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Posted the wrong version

66
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,312
They included special codes

67
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,128
It would steal files from anybody he's used to it

68
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,688
I know he could then use those files to download even more games

69
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,992
So who's trying to piggyback off

70
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,040
Qualities of a Nintendo fans

71
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
Kid games freedom and screwdriver

72
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,368
And tell me about the

73
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
Piracy group

74
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:46,304
Yes OU you have my individual Pirate's who people who just download games will distribute the most ever Maybe

75
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,584
Then you have fees

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Games

77
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,632
And group

78
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
Beaufort MO

79
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,728
There's a lot more attention that is 1 cold

80
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Teen X

81
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Asakusa

82
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
Babe

83
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Released a tool that

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
Robber ironically if you didn't pay for it

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,408
Hayward temperature

86
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Killswitch

87
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,480
Which of course is Right strange when we talk about pirate

88
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
It was stealing games in the first place

89
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
If you stole this off where they didn't like that

90
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Destroy my sweater

91
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:13,696
And then they both have stolen code from other developers included that in the products as well

92
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
And then in another case

93
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
You'll have these open source communities

94
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,423
Does rivalry that because when one group is selling a product and everyone's distribution for free that's not ideological

95
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Frictionless

96
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,263
And then that's the coolest when you get back in adults

97
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
These people where do they find it

98
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,639
Probably the majority of this community

99
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,431
Twerking and discos

100
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
Be gaming

101
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
Social chat platform

102
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
So you be logged in in

103
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,879
If you're playing fortnite or Minecraft at the same time it will stay that next

104
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Profile

105
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
Y-disk

106
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,231
I mean why not take a gaming forum

107
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,255
I guess

108
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
Seoul today

109
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,327
Privacy social benefit to it

110
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,887
You send someone a link you click it you're in the chat room

111
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
But you typically handle into that

112
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
Private space unless someone send you the link

113
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
And then ease of access

114
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
You look into a Discord server your time to come out on

115
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,151
And then the said was massively give you a list

116
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
Okay

117
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
Fazoli's free Nintendo games you can just download

118
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
So they really like

119
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:16,415
Automated and organized to protest not just of guessing the games also distribution them as well and that's intimately tied in with her

120
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
How they communicate

121
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,487
This type of hacking that these

122
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Individuals

123
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
Are undertaking I mean is this kind of

124
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,887
Flexicrew Kitty stuff is a sort of basic or is this actually

125
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,655
Sophisticated

126
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,447
So when it comes to hacking the switch

127
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,215
Self

128
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,239
Is pretty dimes

129
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:31,775
The cases they have

130
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
2

131
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,615
Get possible that these protections on the console itself

132
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
They have to find exploits

133
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
They have to then

134
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,967
Find a Weight Watchers levers Lowe's

135
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,551
An entire Community around developing the software

136
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
To use those and then

137
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
To download games as well

138
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
It's a really complex

139
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
Supply chain

140
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,511
Different hack is doing different things. Ultimately download game

141
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
Forgot to ask why are these hackers

142
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
So sophisticated

143
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
Vacated and going after

144
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
Nintendo switch

145
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,727
I mean why not use that for something more

146
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
Either lucrative

147
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,823
Or I mean hey one that works

148
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,175
Yeah it's definitely not the most lucrative hiking job I mean nobody's really buying

149
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,271
Nintendo switch exploits on same way they bike ride Zero day or maybe

150
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,575
I mean at the end of the day I love it.

151
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Comes down to

152
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
These guys are in

153
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:19,903
Sanely

154
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Passionate

155
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
About Nintendo

156
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
Is Hardware software

157
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
Chinese games

158
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
And that comes out for the full moon

159
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,167
They want to understand how old is console works I want to understand how the ecosystem works

160
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
And

161
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:37,311
Some of the people don't think I'm pirate games they may just have to consult and really enjoy understanding how it works

162
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,847
Villanova's go to the next

163
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
Stop stealing as well

164
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,175
Why does this keep happening

165
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Nintendo

166
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,319
Some of the big difference between the Nintendo switch in the Nova consoles like

167
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,391
The PS4 and the Xbox One or whatever maybe

168
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,975
Those two are pretty much connected to the internet all the time

169
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,327
Online connectivity is like an essential part of the products in online gaming as well

170
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
Switch is possible

171
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
So it's not always going to be online

172
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,519
When you connect to the internet those consoles can check his best empires in games

173
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Best doing it

174
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,591
Suspicious connection whatever maybe

175
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,615
With a switch that doesn't

176
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
I mean

177
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,967
Nintendo will still ban people if they tax it

178
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:19,039
That's probably easier to get around those tracks

179
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
Switch news on the PS4

180
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,903
So is Nintendo even aware that there's

181
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
Users

182
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
Of their products being duct stenosis

183
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
Hacking war going on

184
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,839
The mouse game between the Pirates

185
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
Nintendo

186
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:36,959
There was a old floor in Monastery switch chip

187
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,823
710 to eventually fix and that if you buy move multiple switches cause it's to piracy on it

188
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,431
They also change how the service where I can host switches communicate with Lowe's and that's will spank

189
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
Proof that being said

190
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,271
It is pretty easy to guess around

191
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
Elise Nintendo's

192
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
Scans for pirated games

193
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
Xbox One pirate who

194
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,463
If you have loads of games and that's like Donkey Kong was that was a

195
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
Don't get banned immediately

196
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,351
If he changes Nintendo to Nintendo and just put a bee in the

197
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,631
Company is even nicer

198
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
So is really rudimentary Tech

199
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,447
Song

200
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
Ashley furniture

201
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,823
Joseph you're somebody who I know is almost an Espionage expert

202
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,175
How did you get tips to the Nintendo gaming Community hack Wars

203
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,063
Yeah so we gone to the story originally because my just had a Jason Cutler wrote about Mario Party

204
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
Releasing two days earlier

205
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,439
And we feel well that's pretty interesting but then he gets a Torrance

206
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
Twitter direct messages

207
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,279
People killing in this community being lights

208
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,863
It's a lot crazier than that most games

209
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,143
Will come out 2 weeks

210
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Before

211
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Street dice

212
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
The strange thing was

213
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,335
Someone was apparently got around to these Discord servers

214
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,871
Messaging people saying

215
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,943
Hey I'm Jason from overboard do you want to chat about that

216
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
That was

217
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
Someone impersonating already

218
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,063
Clearly trying to get information

219
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
11 people makes dogs them

220
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
Maybe they make motherboard look bad

221
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Stop

222
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
Instantly

223
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,767
There was something else to the screen and see like a Shadyside

224
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
This is like counterintelligence

225
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,095
Yaya counterintelligence

226
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
Counterespionage amount

227
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,423
Please switch piracy

228
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,847
Almost just make you laugh like you normally report on some really serious stuff and all the sudden you're getting into this Nintendo

229
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Hacking War

230
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
Cesspool and it kind of looks similar

231
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
When you deal with hackers

232
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:29,855
Who would like not nation-states and no organized by becoming also the people who

233
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,671
I'm still the same numbers all the switch hack is whatever maybe

234
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,975
They can be technically sophisticated

235
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Give less of a s***

236
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
And they will do more outrageous

237
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,583
Stuff like this

238
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
Presentation please may you know of course

239
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,959
Hold themselves back will they organize themselves back

240
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,287
These guys have less inhibitions about f****** each other over

241
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
Anika manifests itself in

242
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
I mean let's talk about this

243
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
Doxxing a

244
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
Aspect is it something else

245
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
Across-the-board

246
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,807
What are some of the examples of these guys doxxing each other

247
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
So one case with some sort of internal doors

248
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
Disagreement in the largest Nintendo piracy

249
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,511
7 we not exactly sure what happened

250
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,863
But it ended up with people with non-disclosure agreement with Nintendo

251
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,143
Probably Developers

252
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Open maps

253
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
Employees

254
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
Bing.

255
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,263
This is how people sold

256
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
Debates

257
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,847
When they consulted by hacking or Sober by Tool King

258
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
How to buy dogs

259
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
And then

260
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,175
In another case

261
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
Some of the doxxing is

262
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Pretty transphobic

263
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,367
As well I mean you going to have this in a loss of communities and lost it for hacking communities

264
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,159
Particularly

265
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
Virulent

266
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
In Nintendo switch

267
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,047
You see this transphobia that clearly comes through

268
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,607
In the comments of a post with Lee passing information

269
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,143
And let's talk about this

270
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
The transphobia

271
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
Watch Friends movie

272
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,263
To say that

273
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,287
This isn't

274
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,895
You know I'm seen in The Gaming Community we know that misogyny and homophobia kind of

275
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
Very much

276
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
Is pervasive

277
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,759
Yeah it's hard to say about Lee

278
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,551
Aqi motivations of the

279
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,135
Individual DOCSIS I didn't get in touch with them but

280
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,975
You can definitely tell as a heavy transphobic vibe

281
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
From the comments posted

282
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:17,119
Orthodox think this happens in communities elsewhere as well

283
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Particularly pronounce

284
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Penguin

285
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,495
Multiple trans people get dogs

286
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
And then

287
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,799
Really talkative

288
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
Pacifically full.

289
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
It's almost like they would talk to his not just

290
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Because

291
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,759
There was a disagreement in the Nintendo switch hacking scene but really because I trans as well

292
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
I just a question I have to ask is

293
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
You know

294
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Why

295
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
This is all just because

296
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
Somebody or

297
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:42,975
A group of people

298
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,999
Really really

299
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,791
Super give a s*** about a game

300
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
I mean it's the same way when you have

301
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:53,471
The Minecraft that is ddosing each other at the end of the day that is just a video game

302
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
Some people really want to screw out

303
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:01,151
Some people really care about the reputation of the rain said some people just want to watch the willowbend sometime

304
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,735
And in this case some people really care about the reputation tour in piracy group

305
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
I mean the end of the day elevator

306
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,319
Comes down to

307
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,343
Prize

308
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,135
I mean how many times you heard of

309
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
Hacker

310
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
The Dark Knight

311
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,279
Call rights

312
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:20,607
Men just want to watch the world burn

313
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Thanks for listening to cyber
