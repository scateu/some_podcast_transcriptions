Eagle one package being delivered last week a video of Mark Zuckerberg

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
First online

00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
What are you saying didn't seem right I wish I could keep telling you that our mission in life is connecting people

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
We just want to predict your future behaviors Spectre showed me how to

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
For free

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
Yourself the more we own you really just admit to the ubiquitous and Godlike powerful

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,280
Facebook exercises over modern civilization nice try but no

8
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
He did not because the video was a deepfake story about

9
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:18,080
How group of artists in AI Engineers video of Zuckerberg saying things you would never say

10
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Then upload it to Instagram come in the wake of the Nancy Pelosi deepfake video controversy was amazed

11
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
Major troll one of the most powerful people in the world to expose how the Silicon Valley judge controls

12
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
Jesus to take steps against the proliferation of fake news on its platform for this week's episode salmon

13
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
Tell us more about the hellish world of deepfakes and whether or not it's done made Facebook think twice about a con

14
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:50,080
Who in this is cyber

15
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,688
Price of Sam the deepfake beat you own it

16
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,736
New York Times even bites your stuff

17
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
Let me know

18
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,368
Would you say that this is maybe one of the most

19
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,208
Maybe the biggest defect story that's happened

20
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,560
So far one of them

21
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,352
Recent months

22
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
Yai

23
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
I've been really

24
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,544
Fascinated by how big this has gotten as far as people talking about it and using it as like

25
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
A way to theorize how deep

26
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,152
The future in a really tangible way

27
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
We haven't seen

28
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
It's actually

29
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
How did you first get into

30
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,024
Yeah that is if you like Asian his right now but in late 26

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,864
Teen motherboard found someone posting

32
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
Algorithmically generated p***

33
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
On Reddit

34
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
So that's

35
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,592
Can I wear that began because I was on the sex work and Warren Beatty and also

36
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
So interested in AI

37
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
So

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,248
Yeah that was a perfect Confluence of those things

39
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,040
Discover right place right time

40
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,136
Evolved from service revenge p*** ass back to where

41
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,696
People put their ex-partner or somebody there were just

42
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,744
Morbidly obsessed with

43
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,304
Into a p*** videos that are this

44
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
Extorted Ave

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
You know

46
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,632
Troll

47
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Venge

48
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
Revenge fantasy fast forward now and it's like his dr. Berg is actually talking about ruling the world C face

49
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,152
Which is maybe not uncommon like untrue

50
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
But

51
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,736
I think we're now I mean

52
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
Tell me if I'm wrong

53
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,344
We're bordering on to the the fact that this is actually going to start effect

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,368
In politics and

55
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
Society

56
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah I mean I think it already has affected Society in a way and definitely mean politicians were talking about it I think

57
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
Biden said something about deepfakes like

58
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
This weekend

59
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
I was never going to make a deepfake 2

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,680
Brotherhood

61
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:57,568
Yeah it's that was the the origins were using women's images

62
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,616
Without their consent

63
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,432
It was celebrities and reformers to

64
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
Crib set

65
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
Have tons of them business out there

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,064
So yeah it's

67
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,136
It's been really interesting to see what kind of evolved into being

68
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Panic of life

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
Deepfake

70
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
Tomorrow weather

71
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
I just I just thought about that I was like

72
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,495
Shadman I don't know like maybe

73
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,895
Have a caveat with that it's like it's not going to happen but like one day I'm going to eat my words as like

74
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:38,527
We're heading to The Fallout Shelter

75
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
Zuckerberg one definitely

76
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,391
It's kind of made its Force Facebook to

77
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
Restate and reevaluate how they

78
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,791
Deal with misinformation they've had like misinformation policies

79
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
4 years

80
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,959
It's really made them kind of

81
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,519
Assess

82
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
How they're going to handle things like nolita videos

83
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
Look like one

84
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
And then

85
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
Recent examples of that

86
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:14,879
SodaStream particular though the goal of the artists and the AI Engineers that were the basis

87
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
Six video

88
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
Did that before

89
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,975
What were they trying to expose

90
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,559
They just came up like an art project

91
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,607
In UK

92
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
It's

93
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
An installation where you go in and they use

94
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
Your data to show you

95
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,311
I'm not really sure what things about yourself I think

96
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
But

97
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
That

98
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,223
The Jeopardy fake was part of that are insulation going to promote it

99
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,551
They didn't explicitly say that they were trying to like

100
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:45,599
Make

101
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,183
Facebook do anything they were just putting it out there as like

102
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
Here's an example of

103
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
One of the biggest

104
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,279
Like

105
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
Leaders in Silicon Valley

106
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
Same things that he never said

107
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,423
So really just kind of charge anyway

108
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,215
Speaking to the power of

109
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
Pot Farm

110
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,823
So yeah I think that was their intent with this

111
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,359
This is the kind of poke

112
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,431
The Beast a little bit they definitely sick

113
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
So yeah that's

114
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
The video if you watch it he's talking about like control of Stilton still in data and like controlling the future and things like that so

115
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
It's very ominous it's very ominous I also seems like something he would say or like

116
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,983
It's what he's thinking about and breathing heavily

117
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
What are you saying

118
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,823
Is what took it off to being fake I don't think that

119
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
Like if it's

120
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
Volume has going for your feed

121
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
I don't know if

122
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
It would look like a video of Zuckerberg like

123
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,527
It looks like him

124
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
It doesn't seem not like

125
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,975
Right for sure

126
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
But

127
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
I also

128
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,095
Maybe I wouldn't take the time to really verify it I don't know

129
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
Videos on the neck raising your feet

130
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,983
Like a lot of people who just pitched share like rush to share it

131
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,335
Yes a lot of like share share first ask questions later

132
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Do you think

133
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,407
That this really came off of

134
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
Videos of the Pelosi

135
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Controversy

136
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,831
I think so I think they're working on this before the pussy video

137
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Came out but

138
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
Yeah I think that

139
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:30,559
It got the reaction that it did because of that video because that wasn't an art project that was

140
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Meant to be

141
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,191
To trick people into thinking that she was drunk like that was malicious intent definitely

142
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,079
Yes albums of people shared that millions of views on that

143
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,615
So it was just

144
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:48,735
Fortuitous timing I think on their part to release the Zuckerberg one right after that

145
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,295
Because they're not really dead

146
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,367
Hershey's questions forward and can I say okay we'll Facebook

147
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
Take this one down because they didn't take down the clothes he won

148
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Dunedin

149
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,559
So has this video actually

150
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,839
Force them to

151
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,655
Rethink what they're doing what what is Facebook done

152
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
In the wake of this

153
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
I mean they're we know that they have

154
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,055
They have said they have told the artist

155
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
Who made like a brick one

156
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
That's

157
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:22,527
Because of all the media scrutiny because they're under a lot of pressure about misinformation that they are having two kind of

158
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,367
Evolve these policies basically

159
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
And they're constantly

160
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,207
Influx in changing internally

161
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,047
So yeah they might not be like a policy that played out

162
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
Publicly that they are changing but

163
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
They're definitely thinking about

164
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
If their policies are robust enough

165
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,959
In the future

166
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
To prevent this kind of thing

167
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,287
They told us

168
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:49,407
Their official stance on this is. They're going to treat all of these videos the same no matter who's in them

169
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
If

170
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,575
Fact Checkers Martin is false then they down rank them so they don't show up on like

171
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,367
Hash tag on Instagram or

172
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,671
And stories

173
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
On Facebook there

174
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,791
Less likely to be like tomorrow dead by the algorithm and your feed

175
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,071
If their balls

176
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
So that's kind of

177
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,935
Desert Sands now

178
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,031
I think it's a lot more complicated than that

179
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
Internally for Facebook but

180
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:23,711
That's what we know why have you been so reluctant on this I don't I don't really get it

181
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,783
Reluctant to take on the videos yes

182
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
Seem like it's so obvious to do that

183
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,671
For the Pelosi video also you know there has been videos

184
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,767
Deepfake that's deleted edit Aveeno Trump likes

185
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Speaking really

186
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
As if he's drunk or something

187
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,887
You know there's some videos out there that have been

188
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,959
Borderline like woah this is kind of

189
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,495
Misleading

190
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
I don't want a fake news a minute

191
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Pacific news

192
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
But

193
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
I don't understand Zero Tolerance policy on the

194
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,711
Yeah I mean It's tricky because

195
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,807
I mean they're really they are in a catch-22 about this

196
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,391
If you start giving Facebook the power to take down everything that's

197
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,999
That you deem is fake or satire or you don't like that they're mocking your

198
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,535
Favorite Canada or whatever

199
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
That's definitely I mean that's not a road we want to go down

200
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,399
So

201
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,679
It's

202
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,007
I mean I think that a lot of experts agree that it's

203
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,823
Better to leave these things up and make them very clearly

204
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,639
Marked as not real

205
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
Two experts do agree that the best way to sew

206
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,759
Sports Adventure

207
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Videos is to say

208
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
Explicitly all know

209
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
These are false

210
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
These are not real

211
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:40,255
Yeah definitely yeah I mean a lot of a lot of my first year so yeah it's

212
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,815
It becomes kind of a First Amendment thing it's like well

213
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Is this

214
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Beach

215
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
That should be protected or not censorship if we take it down

216
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,983
The answer is usually

217
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:50,751
Yes

218
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,591
So yeah there right now if you share something that's

219
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Later deemed as fake

220
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,663
On Facebook and get a

221
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,479
Notification that sounds like something you shared

222
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Yesterday

223
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Is

224
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Not real

225
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,111
Here's some more information about it

226
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
The best

227
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,975
Way to handle it right now

228
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
I see these things are evolving so fast

229
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
It's really hard to say

230
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
What will be best

231
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
Pretty sure but it's just damage control

232
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Right now

233
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
I'm throwing this information on file

234
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,495
Of course you know the story is not about

235
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,775
Hacking

236
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Some sort of

237
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,335
You know shadowing group

238
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,151
Steal something which is what we're usually covering here but

239
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
One thing I think that it really shows

240
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
Is the Integrity of data

241
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,783
Going forward

242
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
And how

243
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
Once

244
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,855
It presented the public

245
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
And how we interpret it

246
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Means every

247
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:46,559
So you know I'm wondering a lot of people when it's fashion 2016 when you first started reporting on this

248
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,119
A lot of people were saying you know sort of

249
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
Sound in the apocalyptic

250
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
Alarm bell saying you know

251
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,567
Deepfakes are going to ruin Society ruin our lives ruined countries

252
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,919
There is growing alarm over the use of altered videos online

253
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,479
Especially those known as deepfakes

254
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,807
Which are highly realistic-looking and inaccurate

255
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:13,439
There are concerns about their growing sophistication and the risk they posed a national security

256
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
Do you think that's actually possible being

257
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,351
Someone who's so closely reporting on it do you think it does have posed that threat

258
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
Quote on quote to democracy to

259
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,495
Online

260
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:31,359
I think it was the threat but I think the threat is how we perceive

261
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
What is real and what's not

262
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
I don't think the threat is

263
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,951
Yeah I think that's definitely the biggest rat is educating people on

264
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
How they share things

265
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,327
Looking at things closely before they share them

266
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Yeah it's

267
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
It's definitely

268
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
Arthritis far as

269
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,567
Coming up to the elections like what will be seen

270
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,335
As

271
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,895
True and what's not an especially

272
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
If you can put something out there

273
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
Real and people say oh this is fake

274
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
Doctor

275
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
Whatever

276
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
And if everything is fake nothing

277
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Nothing is Vegas kind of that

278
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
That kind of excitement

279
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,791
I think that this is definitely not a new problem

280
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,863
We're dealing with the same kind of stuff as we were dealing with

281
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,703
Like the early internet like what is real what is real life

282
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
So I mean

283
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
It'll be interesting to see how

284
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
How does

285
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:33,823
Play the

286
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,615
If are the elections but I don't

287
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
Things are going to see like

288
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
People

289
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,223
Making fake

290
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
People Mass

291
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
Believing them because

292
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,623
We have had them at awareness about

293
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,743
And that's part of why we were born on it and a lot of research now is

294
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
I'm including like ethics statement

295
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,071
Which isn't really cool to say

296
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
Data engineer

297
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Before they put it up

298
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
In the wild

299
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
When what where

300
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
What do you mean

301
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,151
I mean you know you put a research paper in it would just be like opens or whatever

302
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,687
Are you very open about

303
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,759
What you're done and what you made but like

304
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,831
Then you leave it to the media or at the store

305
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
Yeah there's groups a kind of

306
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,303
Grapple with how to deal with it in society and now their questions are being asked like in the papers themselves like lbs

307
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
Action on

308
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
Ethics statement

309
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,375
Think like that

310
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
It's kind of

311
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
You're getting ahead of

312
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Free

313
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:39,871
Preact addressing the questions OB surrounding the technology

314
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
Just doing it because we can die for doing it

315
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
How to raise awareness online

316
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Methods

317
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Or

318
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,551
Improve eye protection

319
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
Things like that

320
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,903
It almost seems like deepfakes in terms of political

321
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,927
Medical standpoint

322
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
Could easily just be sort of this

323
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
Evolution of rumor

324
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,583
How people spread uses spread rumors about

325
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,887
Counter candidates that they're against

326
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:06,495
Except this time you have an actual what could be like Donald Trump saying something racist

327
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,311
Jackson.

328
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,407
Something you know I don't know what else like declaring war on someone

329
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,943
You know it

330
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,759
It seems like it's a sort of an evolution of that

331
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,807
And it's really up to us whether or not we're going to be

332
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,671
Did anyone believe that you know of at least a mess

333
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Believe the Zuckerberg video

334
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:32,863
Did anyone report on being like Zuckerberg said this I don't think so because we set the tone on that like we were the first

335
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:38,751
About that so we broke up

336
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
So ain't that kind of

337
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,943
That's something I've seen a lot of people talking I like how it looks so fake because it's obviously fake who would fall for that since I well you know it's fake because

338
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
Cuz I told you it was fake like

339
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,343
Exactly he was saying something else he was saying something really boring

340
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,159
And it was like his voice

341
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
But yeah

342
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
His mouthing everything is not his words

343
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,583
Do you really believe it it also looked pretty real

344
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,935
I don't think I keep seeing with this ever since I've

345
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:15,359
World with aware of defects is likes just how close closer and closer it's getting I'm not singing is like a

346
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Is this

347
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
Video itself perfect yet

348
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,455
Wow that's getting

349
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
Closer and

350
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Closer to

351
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
The possibility where

352
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
A deep fake looks

353
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Exactly like

354
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,879
Reality I think that's the thing that I

355
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
Waiting for cache

356
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,535
You know I if you look at these fake Natty look at that one in particular versus one that was a year ago and

357
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:34,815
Still at

358
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Massive differ

359
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:41,983
Improve so much and they're improving as far as the mess the message that they use them or they make them with

360
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,127
They can make something with fewer images now I used to take a dataset of like

361
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Thousand

362
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,943
Before and now it's

363
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
She was like 1 to 8

364
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,575
How was the one they made Mona Lisa

365
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
Yeah

366
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
So

367
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
That's been really interesting they're making them with just

368
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Text input

369
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,047
Now you can just type in what you want them to say and it'll

370
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Generator

371
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
And the UK cities is like

372
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,471
Cannot read cut a scene or is not required like

373
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,239
Something

374
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,519
Jamaica Movie

375
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,359
A long time in a lot of like Manpower but you just

376
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Let's change that line

377
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,479
But I mean it's

378
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
That's very easy for

379
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
I want to do

380
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
So you say that Biden

381
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
Waiting on this

382
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
In terms of

383
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
He actually said his campaign ever pretty

384
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
How do you see this

385
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
Affected employee

386
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,959
Landscape going forward I mean this is something that a lot of people

387
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
I've been wondering about

388
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,031
I can tell you

389
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
Spokane wanted

390
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
2 disinformation people

391
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,199
And they can't tell me exactly what 2020 will look like but

392
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
The consensus is

393
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
It's going to be a hot mess

394
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Chaos

395
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,111
Do you think you fix will pay partner

396
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
I mean yes

397
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,791
I think so I think just the fact that we're talking about it means it will stay apart

398
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,143
I think that Congress people have been using prefixes like a

399
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,191
Buzzword almost to talk about

400
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,751
Using it interchangeably would like this information

401
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
So yeah I

402
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,151
I do think that it will

403
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
Play heavily in

404
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,015
The political Affairs but I

405
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,087
I don't know it's hard to tell how much of that is

406
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
But

407
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Panda tree and how much is

408
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
Real

409
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
Yeah

410
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,071
Because he's always this this this concept and I want to ask you about it

411
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
How

412
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,143
Potentially a nation-state could start using

413
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
Deepfakes to sort of

414
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Plant misinformation

415
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
About

416
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
Certain people within

417
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Other

418
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
Dislike her

419
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
Targets of their Etc

420
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,919
Do you think they have you seen any evidence of that or

421
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
Is that something you think could happen

422
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:05,087
It actually it happened in Malaysia there was a

423
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
A video

424
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
Eyewear

425
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
I it was hard to tell if

426
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:16,351
The video of the deep fake or not and it was being reported on like is this any fake we don't know

427
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:20,703
Think it ended up being real at the end but that's kind of that example of like

428
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,031
Everyone questioning real thing

429
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
It was that was caught having sex with another man right there is a video going around

430
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,831
People saying Muhammad azmin Ali has denied

431
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
Reports on ASX

432
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
Video puppet sings implicate

433
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Kim

434
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:47,071
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening he said quote I categorically deny this vicious lie

435
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Upon me

436
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,167
This is nothing but a nefarious plot

437
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,703
Assassinate my character

438
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,983
In an attempt

439
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,567
To destroy my political career and then another video is posted where

440
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,895
Would like giving address and saying

441
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:05,503
She confessed it was him or not he was like giving address about it

442
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,295
MP4 like oh that's

443
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
That could be a debate

444
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
Right which

445
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:15,231
I mean

446
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
Intrust Bank

447
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,095
Yes I think we are saying it

448
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,911
Used in other countries

449
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Butts

450
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:28,543
You're not super widespread yet but just the fact that it exists in is out there

451
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
I guess I could be

452
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,359
The future is

453
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,223
Will tell whether or not a real weapon

454
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
Yeah I think

455
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
Writing

456
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
Brightwheel

457
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,111
How to disable wait until you but

458
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
Girl out of people smarter than

459
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,487
Me working on this

460
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,767
From

461
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,679
An intelligence operation standpoint and I would say the real value of it isn't to sort of take down someone because

462
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,007
I think eventually when something is fake it'll likely be

463
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,847
Exposed to space

464
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,127
Photos

465
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
It's tough one by that was

466
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Complete acceptance

467
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
Truth

468
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,783
Manipulated by installing a Morales

469
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,111
But I think for one thing if you look at

470
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
The weather in Russia and how it's it's

471
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
It's actually undertaken

472
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
Influenza outbreak

473
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,280
Misinformation

474
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
To try to promote chaos

475
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
Within a system

476
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
Tennis serve break

477
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
But too disorganized

478
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,776
And I see deep fakes a sort of a potential for that he look at this one in particular

479
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
That's what it is

480
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,128
Destabilized Facebook

481
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,688
Even though it wasn't something that Facebook

482
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
Gotten

483
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,760
Yeah I mean yeah that's

484
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
Definitely

485
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,368
I really good point just that these are not necessarily

486
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,464
It's not that we need to have an answer on things are rather a true or not it's

487
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
That the questions being asked to begin with

488
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,584
And there's is uncertainty

489
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
In the air about it

490
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
The fact that Facebook is kind of

491
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,360
Just because of this one

492
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:16,576
Amazing multibillion-dollar company Sprint challenge by group of artists

493
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Kind of impressed

494
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
Where do you think

495
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,280
You know deepfakes are going to go next at a lot of people are not

496
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:33,216
Question I mean I think they're just going to keep getting more and more realistic

497
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
The pace

498
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,008
This is crazy

499
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
As far as health

500
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,616
It's gotten more real

501
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
I think

502
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:47,552
Yeah I think we're going to see more just manipulated video.

503
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,112
Like with the pussy one that wasn't a deepfake that was just

504
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,720
A video for slow down a little bit so she was slurring Her speech

505
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,536
So I think we'll really see more

506
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
Of that

507
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
Yeah

508
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
I don't know it's

509
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
It's hard as I I mean

510
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
Detective

511
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,032
Seeing so many people working on this issue and I trying to detect it

512
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,568
Detect fake videos in

513
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
Turn and democratize

514
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,384
How that works

515
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Has been

516
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,480
Really fascinating to see

517
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:21,088
Are there any more like private companies get it on this game the

518
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,416
One of the groups that made the Zuckerberg one

519
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:27,232
Is basically like an ad agency they're like

520
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
They're making

521
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Buy custom

522
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,608
Bespoke defects

523
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
So it seems

524
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Not

525
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,640
What's capitalism will find a way to exploit something super evil

526
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
Natural stuff

527
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,736
It was always going to end up being

528
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,088
Metabolism just like everything but

529
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,624
Yeah I think that

530
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,696
That normalizes it a little bit

531
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
This is like

532
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,024
What is the value of a

533
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,072
50 facts thinking about it like what's

534
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,400
What good does a deepfake bring what good could it bring

535
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,520
Hollywood uses deepfake all the time like they

536
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
The use of

537
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,568
To swap in like

538
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:18,176
Carrie Fisher in Star Wars and I think I got us kind of example are we to bring. But

539
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,224
It's always been like a big

540
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
Budget

541
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,784
Yeah

542
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,808
As far as like

543
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:30,976
The Greta Van also hardly seems like a good thing

544
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:37,376
Like that are definitely I mean they're not

545
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,400
They're definitely

546
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,448
Interesting and

547
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,496
Worth talking about

548
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
The gutter

549
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,824
Making them and improving the technology is

550
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,896
A lot of times just having these conversations and talking about

551
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
Things like

552
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
Temperature

553
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:54,528
Body autonomy online and

554
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
The guy who owns

555
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,088
Your face

556
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,648
So yeah just

557
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
As I

558
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,208
As a thought experiment

559
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Good

560
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
I don't know good as I do

561
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,656
So weird working forecast

562
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,472
Telling that this technology really emerged

563
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,496
Interests

564
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
To exploit

565
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,872
Yeah exactly

566
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:24,736
Yeah that's kind of let me know it's kind of felons the Wayside as far as how we talked about the face

567
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,552
It's now it's a lot of like

568
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,856
Politicians and who will

569
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,416
Who will influence the election by using a deep fake butt

570
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,976
Angry singing There's a journalist in together

571
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,024
Does Target have ID fake and

572
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
Harbor Fallout 4 map

573
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
So yeah I think

574
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
It's still happening

575
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,056
All the issues around it as far as like who owns are images online

576
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Things like revenge p***

577
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,992
What's up big issues outside of your face but do you guys going to bring some to the 4 or so

578
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:01,600
Yeah I guess it's a good outcome of this very fuzzy top

579
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:08,000
Well on that note it was good to have you in cyber again glad we weren't talking about PewDiePie

580
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:14,400
