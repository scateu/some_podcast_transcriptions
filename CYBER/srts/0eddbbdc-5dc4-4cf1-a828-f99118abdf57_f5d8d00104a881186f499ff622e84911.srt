Find json Keppler editor-in-chief of motherboard

00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
And this is cyber are podcast about hacking

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,512
I'm feeling in this week for ben maku

7
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,912
Good morning what's the number of mobile devices explode so does the number of attacks on our cell that may be easier to hack into

8
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:45,312
A personal cell phone then you might think

9
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
Call recorded a private conversation and said that recording to a random contact which in the coming weeks

10
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:58,112
Millions of people will get new phones computers Amazon echos Google Home Smart coffee makers

11
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,416
And other Internet of Things devices

12
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:04,512
All these gadgets come with their own privacy surveillance and hacking risks

13
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,328
But there are steps you can take to minimize your exposure

14
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
Suicide be a good time to talk about the motherboard guide to not getting hacked or comprehensive advice on digital security

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,384
We release a new version of the guide every year for the last three years adding and changing things as hacking threats and security

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
Best practices evolve

17
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,248
Here with me today to talk about the guy is Harlow homes

18
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,832
Director of Newsroom digital security at freedom of the press Foundation

19
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:34,976
And Lorenzo franceschi Baker I a senior staff writer motherboard who wrote a huge chunk of the guide

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,120
So we recently published our third edition of the motherboard guide to not getting hacked

21
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,168
Eldorendo can you talk a little bit about

22
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
Where this project

23
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
Began three years ago and

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
Where it's at now

25
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,824
That's a good question actually

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,872
I don't really remember how we

27
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
Thought about doing this but

28
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,224
The question that inspired us to do this I feel like was

29
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
You know what do you tell people

30
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,880
About how they can protect them

31
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,928
It's like if someone comes to you and says

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
How do I not get hacked

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
What do you tell them

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,584
And the answer for us was like a

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
10000 words

36
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
Article

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,008
Which maybe is not the best answer all the time but that was the

38
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
I guess I was dead

39
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
Yeah maybe a little Overkill

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,688
But yeah I edited the guide the last 2 years

41
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Send

42
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm

43
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
I think

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,808
For me it's something that is growing out of arm

45
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Reporting where

46
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,160
You know Joseph and Lorenzo and other people at motherboard are often

47
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
And talking to hackers

48
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Getting sources

49
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,584
And generally being paranoid about their own security but we don't do a whole lot of

50
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,120
Journalism storytelling

51
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Pokeball how to put

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Check themselves

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
So you know we're not we're experts in this only in that we try to Fort

54
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,288
Macaron

55
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
Data and information answer

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,152
But especially grata bus

57
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
Writing like

58
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:58,944
What we do

59
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Forest house

60
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,016
And that's a ways pretty well into

61
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,576
Harlow what you do day today which is

62
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
Teach journalist

63
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Indeed

64
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,512
And I would actually say that

65
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,632
Seeing your guide and other articles that other news organizations

66
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,704
I'm is kind of the best line of defense

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,032
That we have in you know like a advancing that message

68
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
So not a lot of

69
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,408
Journalist and not even just journalists Everyday People

70
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,272
Whatever hat you're wearing at the time can afford

71
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,064
2 or know about

72
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,904
At the type of digital security education that is out there

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
I'm and so it was really really heartening to see members of the press actually like promote these messages and

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
And promote these

75
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,608
Tools and practices

76
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,936
And also just like make it consumable

77
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,800
When people come to you at freedom of the press foundation and say hey we want help

78
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592
What are they usually asking

79
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,200
Well it depends and usually have a

80
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,272
A conversation with the news Oregon

81
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
Two kinds of assess what it is they at

82
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Actually do need

83
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
Sometimes it is what we like to call the low-hanging fruit which is mostly what's represented in

84
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,863
Guide such as you are so such as how do we address

85
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Credentials

86
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,399
Security

87
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:27,007
And sometimes I ate it actually over the years it's

88
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,847
Become a little bit more Nuance in a little bit more granular so

89
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,687
Sometimes we have reporters who either

90
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,807
At the request of their news organization or individually just because they're concerned

91
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,111
I have questions about how

92
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
Shoot further protect themselves

93
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,999
After you retaliated against for something that they print online

94
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,303
Wherever

95
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
And so we

96
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,911
Do I work on things like reputation management

97
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
Defense against doxxing

98
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:03,615
Defense against a lot of tactics that we did see him grow that was covered by so many of these news organizations

99
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
Such as yours

100
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,967
I'm growing out of like in 2013 onwards

101
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,783
Sometimes it has to do with source

102
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,135
Communication I prevent myself as much as possible so if I do

103
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,671
Say it let me know

104
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,975
I'm but I prevent myself from saying

105
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,023
Source protection because it stinks

106
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Credibly in

107
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,375
Incredibly difficult time and it depends on so many factors

108
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
But Source communication

109
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
10 is

110
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Another thing

111
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,007
That people reach out to us

112
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:37,407
As for the reason why is because there's a lot of nuances it's not only like what you know technically what you should

113
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,175
Should be using

114
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
But it's also you know

115
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
What we like to call the first Contact

116
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
Conundrum witches like

117
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
How do you properly

118
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,927
I'm prepare a a source or a potential source

119
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,023
When all they know is like you know how to DM you on Twitter

120
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,119
And how to like level up their security in order to have them or confidential

121
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
Communication

122
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,447
We also

123
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
Talk to people about like

124
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,567
Metadata and Genevieve

125
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:10,687
The pluses and minuses and using it in a journalist

126
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Practice

127
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,271
We have sometimes like the Morris

128
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:20,671
Extreme stuff which I find absolutely fascinating and is what really really in passions me about this job

129
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
Because I love gadgets and getting away with

130
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Stop

131
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,863
You don't like the word stream stuff like

132
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:33,727
Sandboxing and air gapping and extreme travel scenarios

133
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,383
Yeah I learned that you've done some extreme travel scenarios I think you know you want to do a big story about Kaspersky

134
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,151
Ski town in Mexico

135
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
Chicago Avenue

136
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Prepared

137
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,783
You know you made like a throwaway email address to use talk us through what you did to

138
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,623
Therefore that yeah I was a little paranoid about that trip

139
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
So

140
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
What I did for the trip was

141
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,463
I got

142
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,743
A burner

143
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
Phone

144
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
Which is also I guess

145
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:06,751
Like a water that doesn't mean exactly what you think it means I also have trouble with the term burner

146
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
I like to call it a travel phone

147
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
Yes I got it I got to travel phone

148
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,687
I didn't use my work email while there

149
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
I

150
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,063
Has Jason said I created an email

151
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
Difficulty for travel

152
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,159
And I just

153
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,487
And I told my significant otter to

154
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,607
Expect communication from certain people if something happened I was

155
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
Probably being too paranoid

156
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,495
I don't know it was a it was a good exercise to think about

157
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,799
You know what I should worry about

158
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,567
And that's it

159
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,383
And an ultimately I feel like that

160
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,431
The key question

161
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
You know I think a lot of people try to

162
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
Think about tools as Solutions

163
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
And tools can be a solution but they are not

164
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Always this

165
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,767
The first thing that you have to ask yourself is what are you trying to protect

166
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
And boyfriend

167
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,351
Indeed

168
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
Saying you signal you store is not always there

169
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,799
So that's this concept that kind of goes through our entire guide witch

170
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Threat modeling

171
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
And I think

172
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
One thing I like to bring up

173
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
From time to time and I think it'd be

174
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Considered light

175
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:23,039
Very insecure messaging but in a very

176
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,319
Situation at

177
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,343
Who is quite secure

178
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,903
Which is I knew someone whose

179
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Boyfriend was

180
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Surveilling

181
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
Her phone

182
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
And

183
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
You know

184
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,071
Was looking at her messages and looking at her

185
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Chaste looking or emails

186
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
And so she would message on words

187
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
With Friends

188
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
Which had its own mess

189
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Farm

190
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,495
I wish

191
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
You know that guy didn't

192
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Know about

193
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
And that's a very specific and extreme

194
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,895
Situation like you wouldn't think

195
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,919
Words With Friends

196
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Is very secure message

197
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Platform

198
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
Can't start probably doesn't

199
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
But

200
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,319
You know she was trying to

201
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,087
Hide

202
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Certain things

203
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,135
From him

204
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
And that was enough

205
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:02,719
So

206
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
Sweetheart would you guys talk about threat modeling with

207
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
Journalist

208
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
What can the average person

209
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Take away from this

210
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
Idea of like water heater

211
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
That is

212
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Fascinating

213
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Anixter

214
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
I had not

215
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,151
I was unaware of the words with

216
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
But it's

217
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
Exemplary of something that we definitely Duty

218
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,599
As Lorenzo said you know the old adage

219
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Did you signal use

220
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Is taurine is

221
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,743
Kind of like insulting to a variety for variety of reasons

222
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,023
I'm and

223
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
The reason is not because like any of these

224
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,887
These Technologies are bad and they're actually the state-of-the-art

225
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,447
But that's only on the technical level

226
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
And there are so many kind of concessions that you have to make in order to have an

227
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Ineffective

228
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Conversate

229
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,735
So what we actually do in our trainings as we t

230
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
Teach this along a major

231
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
So if you can imagine like an X and A Y ax

232
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,903
And along your y axis

233
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:09,023
You actually know that's the vertical line what you have is like

234
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,631
How effective a particular platform is

235
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,983
In allowing you to have you know the kind of confidential conversation that you need

236
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,567
And so you know they act like once again like signal does

237
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,639
Really really well at that but then we also have other

238
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,735
Applications out there such as like WhatsApp such as Facebook Messenger

239
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,527
Such as Words With Friends

240
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Apparently

241
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:36,159
But then and you know they they all have their different rankings on how

242
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
True they are

243
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
To you know

244
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,047
Technically speaking maintaining the confidentiality of a conversation

245
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,143
But as your attitude points out there's also this XX

246
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,775
That's where it's like how available something is and how applicable it is given a certain situation

247
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,103
And this is always going to be subjective and so

248
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,127
For instance

249
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:59,967
Signal is really really awesome but like you know like it's

250
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
Really

251
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
I guess it's

252
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
Mostly prevalent and mostly accessible from

253
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:09,183
The hacker Community because you saw that episode of mr. robot or whatever

254
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,511
I'm so there are only going to be like a certain subset of

255
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,583
People who can have a confidential conversation with you

256
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Over signal

257
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:23,007
And also I'm not only like this apply to people who are in a domestic violence situation

258
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:25,567
But also applies to

259
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
People who might go through a border crossing

260
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:33,503
If someone sees signal on your phone you're going to be open till like extra questioning if not worse

261
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:39,135
Or if you're in a country where you know like actually you can't reach

262
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,183
The Google Play Store because

263
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
You know Absentia

264
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
Whatever and so

265
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,047
Being as like signal is not available

266
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:46,815
Currently

267
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
Over any other means

268
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,167
That's going through you know bar you from using

269
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
And so

270
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,495
I'm this is why you know

271
00:11:55,007 --> 00:12:01,151
Maybe like something like WhatsApp is a little bit more appropriate for the situation just because the the

272
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,175
Fact that it's so ubiquitous

273
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,967
Gives it a lot of cover

274
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
Right by MetaBank City great

275
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
Place to have a certain conversation

276
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,975
Even though we know that there are you know just kind of flaws and implementation in WhatsApp but you can just kind of

277
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:15,999
Get around it that way

278
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,279
I'm as long as

279
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
People are just

280
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
If not using

281
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,583
Unibasic

282
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
Text messages I think

283
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
There's a lot of wiggle room in

284
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,775
Right so I think I in our guide we say over and over again the reason that the guy does

285
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Is 10000 words and not

286
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,127
You signal used tour end of story

287
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,223
Is there's an excellent gift though where it's like Bart Simpson just like

288
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:42,111
Banging a pot saying you signal used her you could have published that should have done that

289
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,183
But I think the answer is always

290
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Plate it depends

291
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,487
Depending on what you're trying to

292
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Protective

293
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,863
You know but there are some sort of like overarching best practice

294
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Is why the guy that

295
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,167
Is that all

296
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
I think

297
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,215
You know I don't want to

298
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,031
Run through the entire thing here you can read it on motherboard if

299
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
If you're interested but

300
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
Some basic stuff is like

301
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
Use two-factor authentication for most things

302
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,247
Unless you are possibly subject to sim hijacking

303
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
Which is our first episode on Cyber so

304
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,367
If you are subject that use a different

305
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
Sometime two-factor Authentication

306
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
Lorenzo can you talk a little bit of

307
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
About that

308
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,303
Yeah I mean to factor is a great example of

309
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
Server and advice that I want as always

310
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,679
Given everyone when you know

311
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
But like

312
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:35,615
If people are relatives they know it Christmas or Thanksgiving ask you like what should I do not to get my email hacked

313
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,431
Like two-factor multi-factor is a good answer

314
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
But the pitfall is

315
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:45,087
You may depend on your phone number and your phone number may not be as a

316
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Secure as you think

317
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,951
And that's all we talked about in the first episode and we reported on it

318
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,231
For a while

319
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
And that's a great example of like how

320
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
A tool or rather a concept that is

321
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
By itself good

322
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Can still be weak

323
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
Or rather has a week

324
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
And you know we go back to you single you store like

325
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,615
You know tools are tools and it depends on the situation it depends on

326
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
It depends

327
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,175
Who is going after you

328
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
If you wanna put it that way

329
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
Yeah so this year we beefed up the two

330
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Two-factor Authentication

331
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
Transection of this

332
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
Send recommended

333
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
You know most people

334
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
You should probably use

335
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
An app base

336
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
Two-factor

337
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
An or a

338
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,119
You know with the app it's not really that much

339
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
More difficult than using

340
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
SMS

341
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Just a matter of

342
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Setting up sass

343
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Some settings and

344
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Internet

345
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Harlow

346
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:43,711
A job and that's another place where there are also like a lot of nuances that actually have two

347
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,527
To do with you know the way that people actually use things

348
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
I agree 100%

349
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,903
That locking down

350
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,279
Your phone number so you don't have to rely on SMS messages for two-factor Authentication

351
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
Is

352
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,423
The best like you should definitely be using an app-based or hardware token

353
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
A solution

354
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,591
That said there are a couple of things that people should think about when they're doing two-factor Authentication

355
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
And this

356
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:18,271
These are tips that I've learned after like you know years of working with it and making mistakes myself and also seeing people

357
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Struggle with it

358
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,599
The first thing that you should know is that

359
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,719
Most people go for you know Google Authenticator as their go-to for

360
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,559
The software token the the app-based two-factor auth solution

361
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:36,447
Just know that you know there are cases where those will not be backed up

362
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,031
So if you drop your phone in the toilet or like it gets

363
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:46,431
You drop it in the subway you're going to struggle because you will not have access to those two

364
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
Actor off tokens and so

365
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
Migrating over to a new device

366
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,831
Is something that you have to plan for in advance

367
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,415
I've been in situations where I have kept phones

368
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,231
4 years in a drawer because like I mean

369
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,071
The two-factor authentication codes from off of that device before I move it over

370
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,399
And also like the more accounts that you use

371
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,679
The more cumbersome that beat

372
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
So just be aware of that

373
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:15,615
There are apps that are alternative like coffee for instance or 1password

374
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,967
Which will allow you to you know like I keep those

375
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
Two-factor auth codes linked

376
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
To an account

377
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:28,927
And that means that your two-factor off codes are synced online and that means that your your security of those two-factor auth codes

378
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,719
Are linked to the security of

379
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
That platform

380
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,535
That you're using and so that's another thing that you have

381
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,303
Have to wait

382
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,959
Finally I always want to remind people that whenever you're setting up two-factor authentication which is

383
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Is amazing and you

384
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Should continue to do so

385
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
Be aware that there are backup

386
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
Either you know in the case

387
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,479
Google there might be like 10 codes that you can printer download to a file that you

388
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Somewhere safe

389
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,575
Be mindful of that

390
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,391
And do take the time to print out those back up

391
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,975
Codes because if ever you get like totally locked out of your account

392
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
That's going to

393
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
To help you out of

394
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:11,167
I think we're doing this episode now because it is around the holidays when a lot of

395
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
People buy new device

396
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Isis and

397
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,311
Also our hang out with family who say how can I avoid getting hacked

398
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
You're playing grandkids sysadmin

399
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Witches

400
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
What I like to call

401
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,943
Yeah it's great

402
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,503
Hello what do you do when you get a nude

403
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,295
Device like what are the first things that

404
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Tattoos

405
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
Pura d'Or

406
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
Migrate to settings

407
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Name something you set up

408
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,671
Years ago

409
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,023
I kind of like to do it manually because

410
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,583
I'm a little bit of a masochist in that way

411
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
But a table. It depends on the device if it is a new phone the first thing that I do is act

412
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,775
Actually go to the restrictions

413
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
This is

414
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,847
Speaking from an iPhone perspective

415
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:56,223
Go to the Restriction setup that restriction pain which is now like buried Within

416
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,759
Screen time for some reason

417
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,903
And I use that there parental controls that prevent an iPhone from doing anything fun

418
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,791
And use that in order to just kind of rain in the apps that are going to be on your phone

419
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
Another

420
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,911
Let's see whenever I get an Android device

421
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
I like

422
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,983
I just have a look

423
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
At

424
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:25,407
The apps that are on there and make sure that like I'm using the granular permissions in order to rein them in as well

425
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:30,015
I think another thing that actually so like

426
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,039
People are going to get

427
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,647
Internet of Things devices like you know I was smart coffee machine or

428
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
Light bulb

429
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,743
That you can program or whatever

430
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,047
They're so pretty colors

431
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
They're super cool

432
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:48,703
I guess like this isn't necessarily something that you do with those

433
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,751
But be mindful of

434
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
The fact that they

435
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Cher

436
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:00,223
Internet connectivity with other devices like your phone like your computer or whatever that you might want to protect

437
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
A little bit more

438
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:06,623
So cool thing that you might do is actually setting up an extra Network on your like home router

439
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,743
In order to just like enforce a little bit of separation between the the the coffee machine

440
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Gene and you don't like

441
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
Like the phone that you call your mama on

442
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
Let's see what else

443
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,447
I don't know oh yeah and like you know who be Alexa and the

444
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,543
Smart. You know the Google home in like all of those things

445
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,663
You can also like you know do the same thing exercise caution that way

446
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:36,063
But maybe that's the coolest thing that you can do is like when you have visitors over the holiday let people know

447
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,647
Conversations might be monitored and something Google

448
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Yeah I mean

449
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
The way that I come down on

450
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Google home and Alexa

451
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
Psoriasis

452
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
Not even once

453
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,863
It's like put it in the trash

454
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,727
And I mean I might be being a little bit too paranoid and especially because

455
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
Some companies are better than others like

456
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,615
You're probably a little better off with a homepod then you are a Google.

457
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:06,527
Isn't even Google. Is that right is that it's an Amazon Echo.

458
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,087
And to actually one of the things about that is

459
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,647
If I get all kind of falls down to account

460
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
And so like when you think about

461
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
How awesome Google

462
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:19,839
Is in giving you control over how your data is managed

463
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Rather how your

464
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:27,775
Count is managed and safeguarded they're far better than Amazon at that and so like if it all

465
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,079
All falls down to you know like how

466
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,943
Yeah how easily configurable my account settings are

467
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
And like yeah

468
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,575
Go with Google although like I totally agree with you but it at all

469
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
In the trash

470
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:47,487
Yeah I mean we not to get too far into this but I do feel like I'm buying one of those

471
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,511
As a gift is

472
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
A little NF

473
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,375
Just in the sense that you are

474
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
You should have to opt into

475
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Now putting us

476
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
Speaker in your home

477
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,311
But at least some of the privacy setting

478
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Targeting

479
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,919
Better so hopefully you didn't buy your mom a

480
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,199
A Google home

481
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,527
But if you did make sure the settings are all set up on there

482
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,879
This is an interesting conversation because I've been thinking about getting

483
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
A surveillance device for my cat

484
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:23,328
And I was reading a story yesterday on the other times actually that review

485
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,376
A few of these devices that are like at specific

486
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
I guess or marketed

487
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
For pet owners

488
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,032
And I like the fact that they reviewed the review devices

489
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,104
With that in mind so like they gave them to it one of those

490
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Information security specialist

491
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,944
And they did like a

492
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,760
You know it's an analysis of the risk

493
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
There

494
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,392
And I was thinking like should I buy this path whatever brand name or

495
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
Just buy a nest

496
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Camera or

497
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Just put up

498
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,512
An old Android device

499
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
Pino

500
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
In the corner so I can

501
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,656
Make sure my cat is not killing himself shout-out to Haven

502
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
Cool app

503
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,056
I built by The Guardian Project in collaboration with freedom of the press Foundation

504
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:09,408
That turns an old Android into a

505
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
DIY security device

506
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,248
So my fear there would be

507
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552
Like is that Android phones secure

508
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
And does it need to be

509
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
I have the same

510
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:24,256
Cuz I just got a dog and I have no idea what he does while I'm gone so if you have any thoughts

511
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,584
On Androids

512
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,656
You know you want to put as a security camera in your house

513
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,216
See what your pet is doing but you

514
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:35,520
Probably don't want it on the internet

515
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,800
Streaming at all times

516
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
So I'm

517
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
First off

518
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:47,296
It's definitely like you know you might have concerns about Android security especially if your phone is really really old and

519
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,368
Not receiving the proper updates and we all know that like

520
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,928
As Android devices

521
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,952
I guess

522
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Get older

523
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,024
The

524
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
Their vulnerabilities

525
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
You don't like

526
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
Definitely

527
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,448
That said that a lot of like you know the

528
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,288
A privacy piercing invasions that happen with

529
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
Ghetto home surveillance

530
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
Devices

531
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,384
Happens to be that

532
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
Those devices are

533
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Exposed directly to

534
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,832
To the internet in a way that and a potential attacker could like you know just kind of brows them on Showdown

535
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,648
Right or are linked up

536
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:28,512
To IU no third-party services that have not put as much resources

537
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,328
Into the security of that overalls

538
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
System that makes it vulnerable to

539
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,656
Two people eavesdropping on it

540
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
Are surveilling it

541
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
We

542
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,288
You know that means you're going to do what you want to do

543
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
But ultimately

544
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,104
One of the

545
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
The benefits

546
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,432
To Haven I'm actually is the fact that

547
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,784
One year it can be configured in order to send

548
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,808
That

549
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,624
Data over signal to your phone number Direct

550
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,904
Play so there is no third

551
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
Party

552
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,232
That is able to have like a

553
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Unencrypted access

554
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
To you know

555
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,072
Your securities

556
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,936
Or you can also configure it to go over of hidden service over tour

557
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,496
So hidden Services actually cut out like

558
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
The entire

559
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
The possibility

560
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
City of

561
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,640
Another purse

562
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Being able to access

563
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,968
Is that because you share that hidden service

564
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,272
With yourself and with whomever else

565
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
Legends

566
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,904
So I would do want to do like maybe a rapid-fire advice

567
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:30,464
Segments here

568
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,536
And because there are some things that probably everyone should

569
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
To do I mean maybe there

570
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
Some

571
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Exceptions

572
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Spy I think for the most part

573
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,728
Like good advice don't reuse passwords

574
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
Oh gosh

575
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
Yeah

576
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
Dory's password

577
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Ever

578
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,872
Use a password manager like

579
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,176
Your LastPass or 1password or

580
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Keepass do you have a favorite

581
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
I love

582
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
All of the password

583
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Managers

584
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
Keepass

585
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,624
See is my hands-down favorite

586
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
1password

587
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,976
Really really awesome LastPass Lovett

588
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,608
I keep your apps and your operating systems up-to-date always sort of update the software

589
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Especially if it's a

590
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,400
Security update

591
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,704
I don't think there's any

592
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
Controversy over that

593
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Is there

594
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:20,640
No there's no controversy about that except sometimes I I find it

595
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:25,248
A little bit disheartening that you might be an Enterprise situation and

596
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:29,856
I give that advice but then like the IT person is like will actually like you know.

597
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,672
Bespoke software on the new version to hold off

598
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,440
I'm like oh God

599
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:39,840
I think other reasons people don't update are you know the pop-ups are annoying and they feel like they have

600
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,888
Take a note security update like every 3

601
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
3 days and they're like

602
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
Tomorrow I'll do it tomorrow

603
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,008
And also sometimes

604
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Psy

605
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
Yeah new operating

606
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Systems on older devices

607
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,128
They run a little bit

608
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
What's slower so

609
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
I think that's something we're

610
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,272
The software developers have to get a little bit better at chess

611
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Just making sure the

612
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,576
That there you know their updates

613
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,624
Breaking all devices are made

614
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Making them run super

615
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,440
Slow I think I was gone a lot

616
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,720
Better at that over the last

617
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Fierce but

618
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,816
Yeah and I'm in an axon 7 and I

619
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Maybe

620
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
The next iOS sir

621
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,424
And the one after that also

622
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Some slow down

623
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,008
Other stuff

624
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
Disable Flash

625
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Wheatley core that

626
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,408
Yeah unlikely

627
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:31,296
You probably don't need to do yourself cuz Chrome and other modern browsers already

628
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,064
Do it bite

629
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,368
Default I don't know exactly an hour all the rules but

630
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,416
You so don't have to worry too much

631
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
By default Google Chrome

632
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,048
Actually which I really really

633
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:47,680
Appreciate their default setting is to notify you if like a site your visiting

634
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Requires Flash

635
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,240
Which is great

636
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
Harlow where do you come down on anti

637
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
Virus

638
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,384
It depends

639
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
Full force off of Windows

640
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,200
Defender

641
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,272
Is already like you know I'm pretty capable

642
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,928
I worry about there certain situations I worry about like the Telemetry aspect of it we're like it will just send random Fire

643
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,232
Files off of your computer to to Microsoft

644
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,072
However you can still take advantage of Windows Defender and

645
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,352
Still you know like

646
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,144
Tone down the telemetry

647
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
I think that's

648
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,240
There are a couple of

649
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
Good ones

650
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,104
On the market for you no like

651
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,152
For your PC such as

652
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:29,920
Avira

653
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,944
Which is

654
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
Bayside

655
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
Germany Avast

656
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,296
Does the old standby that everybody loves

657
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,624
And also for mobile the

658
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
Group Lookout

659
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:43,488
Has a great antivirus especially for Android

660
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,120
And also they contribute an amazing amount of research into mobile

661
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,656
Security ecosystem and

662
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
They should just

663
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,216
Commended for the work that

664
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,056
I learned that you want and Antivirus conference

665
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,080
To start writing

666
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,176
Answer this question of whether or not we still need antivirus in 28

667
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
18 cm

668
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
2019 South

669
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,624
Where did you come down at dangerous conference ever since he left the country for this

670
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
It was a very good conference

671
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,256
But I learned that the question whether you should use antivirus

672
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:20,608
He's more controversial than I thought I did not think that

673
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,704
My Twitter followers enjoyed fighting over this so much

674
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,264
I kind of wish I did before writing the story

675
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,104
But yeah it's hardly said a really depends

676
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,456
And what I learned about it when I like talk to people about this is that

677
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,784
It's better to have it than not

678
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
In most cases

679
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,648
But you know obviously if you are for example let's say someone who makes

680
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,976
Tools for the US government

681
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,000
Did they use

682
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
In very sensitive

683
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
Operations

684
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:56,704
Maybe you don't want to run an antivirus on your home computer

685
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:00,288
Because then those tools may end up getting uploaded

686
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,616
To a Russian company that may be asked

687
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,896
By their garments

688
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
2

689
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,712
Talk about it

690
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,552
That is not writing example it's like something

691
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
A story that was reported last year

692
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,184
So yeah I mean I like that word

693
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,744
What lightweight telemetry itsa very nice

694
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
Swore that

695
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
It's kind of like

696
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
What does it actually mean

697
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,376
And the it means data

698
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,192
Or files from your computer end up on somebody else

699
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Computer

700
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,312
So you have to think about whose computer it is and who can actually Force

701
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
Company to

702
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,152
Andover

703
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,480
I'm so ad blocker I'm a huge fan of bad blockers

704
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,760
Script blockers that's her

705
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Nothing

706
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
You guys both

707
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Them

708
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
I am

709
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
Also I think that I teach

710
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,928
People in the low-hanging fruit

711
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,696
Discussion

712
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,512
Is how to put their Shields up on basic web

713
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,072
And I recommend three things

714
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,400
A reputable ad blocker I personally like

715
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:03,264
Ublock origin I sometimes like those three

716
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,104
You know there's a couple of other ones out there but like you know those are the two that comes to my head

717
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,176
Also I using a heuristic

718
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,504
Stick based tracker blocker like

719
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
The best one is

720
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,600
The Privacy Badger by the f

721
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
And also

722
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
Https everywhere

723
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:26,304
And those three are getting pretty much like your Shields

724
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
4 route

725
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,376
And also fun fact you should

726
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,960
Should be able to and you have to dig into like the

727
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
Extension settings

728
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:39,616
But for each of those enable them in incognito mode so you know when you're doing your private browsing

729
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
I'm using are quote

730
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
By the way

731
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,456
When you're doing that private browsing

732
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
You still have it

733
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,296
Right and on that note

734
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344
Don't Go Wild on

735
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Extensions

736
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Biondo's like

737
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
Trailer been a lot of

738
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,952
Ostrich eggs

739
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,024
Elite data or have active

740
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
Do we still on data.

741
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,120
In general

742
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,168
Be careful about what your

743
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,192
Yeah you're giving

744
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
Or I'll priorwood

745
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,824
Yes agreed agreed the cool thing about

746
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,640
Chrome is well two things I mean

747
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,176
I personally wouldn't

748
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,224
Diaz Cavalier about the

749
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,040
Extensions that I allow into my life but

750
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:24,672
You should definitely be aware of the permissions that they asked

751
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,208
For so you can kind of Judge

752
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
For yourself

753
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:32,864
Also take advantage of you know the different personas so at least if you're going to have like a

754
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
Crazy

755
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,680
Extension that I don't know like replaces

756
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,496
No instances of the word Trump with like a

757
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,288
Picture of a cat or whatever

758
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,104
If you're going to do that

759
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,968
Do it in a different Persona so I worth it

760
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,296
But do that in a different Persona so you're just like you know you don't

761
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
Expose your

762
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,184
Private browsing or your most important browsing

763
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
To you know a potentially malicious

764
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
Extension

765
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,840
And also there's a cool flag if you

766
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,168
Dig for it and you know like Chrome / Flags

767
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
That

768
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,240
Is isolate site

769
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
Ya site separation

770
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,616
And so it's like it what it does is it

771
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Further boost

772
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,432
Your ability to you doki

773
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,528
Malicious browsing from affecting other tabs and other windows

774
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,392
Another controversial one where do you come down on VPN

775
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:33,024
Like I feel like a few years ago it's like using VPN always everywhere even at home

776
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
I

777
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:38,144
Now there's like a little bit of discussion over with like whether you really need to use

778
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
All the time but yeah

779
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,520
I love them I love them so much

780
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
I understand

781
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
The

782
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,872
The controversy there

783
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,408
I'm so

784
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:55,808
Definitely what vpns do is you know they protect your ISP and other people

785
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,136
On the network from knowing exactly what you're doing all they know is that you're on it

786
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,184
Imenso

787
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,976
One of the reasons why

788
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,816
Certain privacy Advocates kind of minimize the importance of VPN

789
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,144
Has to do with the fact that and we should all Pat ourselves on the back

790
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,704
That art traffic is

791
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,728
Increasingly in

792
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:20,128
It's only really really really amateur and unimportant sites that are not h

793
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
PPS

794
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
They're only http

795
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,344
Answer one of the reasons why people were so enthusiastic about you

796
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,368
Using a VPN

797
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:36,256
I'm especially on networks that they don't control like in public like at a Starbucks or in an airport or whatever

798
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,608
I'm have to do with the fact that when sites were not encrypted

799
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:47,008
They were sending a lot of data like such as usernames and passwords and stuff like that out in the clear and hackers can grab it

800
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
I got it

801
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:54,432
I'm answer now like that's less of a danger and by the way if people aren't aware if ever you are on a website

802
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,456
And the

803
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,504
Form for your username and password

804
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,528
Is not

805
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Encrypted

806
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
Meaning it doesn't have an http

807
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,648
You will know

808
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:07,232
That like literally anyone with visibility on to that Network

809
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,536
So

810
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,584
But that's it

811
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,424
Vpns are an excellent tool for guitar just

812
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
Kind of

813
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,800
Keeping your browsing history out of the eyesight of your ISP

814
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:24,896
And from a privacy perspective especially since like you know the

815
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
Since it was ruled

816
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
That is

817
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:28,992
Huskies

818
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
Quid

819
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,576
Actually use your browsing data in order to like

820
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,600
Serve you ads

821
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
That's actually a laugh

822
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,256
I feel that like you know I just don't want to give that dated

823
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,304
So this is actually the primaries

824
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Yia

825
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
Very very much

826
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,960
So we have time for one more tip each

827
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
I'll go first

828
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,800
So when we talked a little bit about but not

829
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
A lot is

830
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,408
Making sure the app level permissions on your phone

831
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,480
You aren't leaking your location data or

832
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,784
Have permissions that you don't want them to have

833
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,856
I'd recommend just going through iOS or Android and

834
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
Honestly deleting any apps

835
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
Apps that you don't use or don't trust

836
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:12,256
But beyond that you can turn off

837
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,328
At when they're allowed to access your location and

838
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,864
If they're allowed to ask

839
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,632
Tessa Dever

840
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,448
It's especially important on things like

841
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
Strava origin

842
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,496
Is anything I

843
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
McMaster

844
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
Positions and then

845
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:25,824
Keeps that

846
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,360
In upload it somewhere

847
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,688
Pilot you have any any last

848
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,992
Stop parting words we covered a lot I think

849
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,576
No that is very very Sound Advice

850
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,904
I will say one thing

851
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:46,560
This is an extremely paranoid thing and this is definitely not advise that 99% of people

852
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:52,960
Will take but turns out Lyft will still work Google Maps will still work if you have your location

853
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
Services off

854
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
You just have to manually

855
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
Type in the address

856
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,824
And also there

857
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,104
Plenty of ways

858
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,432
I'm outside of accessing your GPS

859
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
That

860
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,016
An application

861
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
Can ascertain Where You Are

862
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,624
There's a really really cool site

863
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,464
And project called wigle.net which associate

864
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,792
Physical locations on Earth with IP addresses

865
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,608
So you know what I mean that there's more than one way to

866
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,376
Just kidding cat

867
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
Since when

868
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
All

869
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,520
Traveling Industries holidays

870
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
Maybe don't

871
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,848
Dumb tweets

872
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,920
About where you're going if you don't want the whole internet to know

873
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:37,504
Maybe don't post a picture of your vacation if you don't want the whole International

874
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
You know I like

875
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,624
I go back to the original question or one of your first question

876
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,672
Which was my trip to Max

877
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
The code for the Kaspersky conference

878
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,048
You know if I was going to Mexico for vacation I would

879
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,096
Take different precautions then

880
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
If I was going to Mexico

881
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:53,888
Comfort security

882
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
So think about that like

883
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,776
You know when I went to Mexico for that conference

884
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,104
Jason knew that I was going my family that I was going

885
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,688
And probably didn't renew because I registered online but

886
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,224
If I'm going to have

887
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
Personal

888
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,344
Maybe I want to like tweets from the airport or you know

889
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
Think about that life

890
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
Intel Twitter

891
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,440
Basically public

892
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
Facebook

893
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,024
Is anybody can be

894
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,560
Just think about that

895
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,376
I think Cindy screenshotted and shared elsewhere even if

896
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
Even if you have your

897
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
Privacy

898
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
Private art

899
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
Friends only

900
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,104
Thank you guys for coming

901
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,944
This is the audio version of the motherboard guy's not getting hacked

902
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,784
Abridged the whole version is up on motherboard. Vice.com

903
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,576
I can Finance you Google it

904
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,624
We've updated it now three times

905
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,184
I walked it again next year or

906
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,488
Next time we need to make

907
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,536
A massive change because

908
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,328
All the stuff is always in flux

909
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,656
It's always changing depending on different threats in a syringe

910
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,192
Thank you very very much

911
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:07,104
This week's episode was produced by me Jason Keppler

In the meantime please tell your friends about us and consider giving us a review on Apple podcast
