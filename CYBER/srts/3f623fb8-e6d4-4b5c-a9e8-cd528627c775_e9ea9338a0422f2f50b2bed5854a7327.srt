1
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
Virus

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Eagle One

3
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Package being delivered they are the hackers hacker that nobody knows back

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:35,328
Nobody even knows if they're just one person or several all we know is Phineas Fisher as hacked

5
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:41,728
Embarrassed and exposed some of the world's most powerful spyware companies that have connections to places like the

6
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:48,128
The FBI doesn't of other law enforcement and spy agencies all around the world

7
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,528
Then they vanish completely Without a Trace its mother

8
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
Reporter Lorenzo franceschi because he has been one of the Premier reporters on the beat

9
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
Several times

10
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:07,328
Well we made contact with Phineas Fisher again

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
I'm Batman coup and this

12
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,568
It was a summer of 2014 I think it was the week of black hat and desk on

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,152
Which made it pretty funny actually when this happened

14
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
So

15
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
Someone

16
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,224
About time

17
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,064
Someone hacked into the servers of Kingfisher

18
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,880
German British company that makes

19
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,928
Spyware for garments

20
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
All around the world

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,256
And adopt

22
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,816
All they could find online

23
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
So this is a pretty

24
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
Classica hack

25
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
M Leake

26
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,448
Cooperation

27
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:50,336
The goal was ostensibly to embarrass the company and damage it as much as possible

28
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,616
How to give

29
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,944
How to give listeners some contest finfisher

30
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:00,320
Has been in the news especially during those years for selling

31
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
Spyware tool

32
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,416
Questionable government like Ethiopia

33
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,280
Other Middle Eastern countries that used it to spy on dissidents and Taurus

34
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,352
So this was clearly an attempt to you know

35
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,168
Got some revenge and punish them for their

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,960
Alleged crimes I guess

37
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,056
The individualistic responsibility called themselves Phoenix Fisher

38
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
Play on the name of in Fisher

39
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,176
And they came out on Reddit

40
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,200
On the

41
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
R / Anarchy

42
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,296
Subreddit which was very interesting choice

43
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
And

44
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,928
It was clear that whoever was

45
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,768
I'd like some anarchistic

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
Ideals answer of you know anti

47
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,144
Anti-capitalism in Thai

48
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
Surveillance ideas

49
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,264
After this hackers completely disappeared

50
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
And then what did you hear

51
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
About them

52
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
So fast for a year

53
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,456
Almost a year in July of 2015

54
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,808
Hacking team the main competitor of finfisher gets hacked

55
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:09,696
And older stock account online very much in the same fashion as in Fisher

56
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
And we're talking

57
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
You know company emails

58
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
Source code

59
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:17,888
Yeah internal emails beta

60
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,472
Varian document Financial staff

61
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
Spreadsheets

62
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:27,104
And I just had the source code which was very bad cuz that bad that point anyone could just

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
Download it and make their own action team spyware

64
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,016
And obviously clearly this was

65
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:39,392
This was a big problem for customers cuz they had to stop their operations to

66
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Recover from the hack

67
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,536
And I called that hack and I initially immediately I thought

68
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
Could this be the same person I mean

69
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
I can't even kingfishers are very similar companies

70
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,752
That the way that they had happened was very similar

71
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
I just had a guy

72
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
Feeling that this was maybe the same person

73
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,712
Set a time that I can Team Twitter account followed me and it was under the control of the hacker

74
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,064
So I DM them saying hey I'm a journalist can we talk

75
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,880
NBA agreed and we chatted for a while and then

76
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,256
The hacker used is all the Twitter account that they created for the finfisher hack

77
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
To claim responsibility for the hockey team hackers well

78
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,887
So by using their old Twitter account babe

79
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
Prove that they were the same person

80
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Sun or the same group

81
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,335
And what was interesting after that was the day instead of Disappearing like they did

82
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,407
Taylor before and this case has Fisher stayed

83
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
They remained and on Twitter

84
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,855
They tweeted here and there they trolled packing team another espira companies

85
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
And they didn't really

86
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
They didn't disappear like they did the year before

87
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
And then months later they had more hat

88
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,863
They have to listen in Spain

89
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
Then they have to turkey's government

90
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,191
And

91
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,799
They were clearly trying to inspire more people to get to become hacktivist

92
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,919
They published on my fastest and you know it's time to take control

93
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,479
It's time to fight back against yuan

94
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,295
Capitalism answer with the surveillance Society

95
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,855
And companies like temperature in hacking team

96
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
And they were trying they were clearly trying to

97
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,231
Encourage more people to join their cause

98
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
So what does the infosec community

99
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
At this point

100
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,071
Think

101
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
About face

102
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,935
Beneficence always been an interesting character for the infosec community

103
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,007
Everyone has always agreed that the hackers

104
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
Are very skilled

105
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,359
I was cleaning the work of someone that knew what they were doing

106
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,199
So everyone was always very curious about who they were

107
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:44,831
It always seems to me that Phineas Fisher kind of comes up among infosec people is sort of

108
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
One of the Worlds

109
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,903
The world's best hackers

110
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
In This Very classical

111
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
Old school way

112
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
That you know the community

113
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Be about right

114
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
Like it's sort of like the LoveSac

115
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Packers

116
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,679
Looking for a very skilled and they're kind of the burn it down and our kiss

117
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Types

118
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
But this is somebody who

119
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Repeatedly has gotten away with

120
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,591
Is very interesting character is funny

121
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:12,991
He's right upside details and I'll people who are very impressed when he published power reactor both conditioner

122
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Hacking team because

123
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,087
He went into all the details explained very well

124
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
Show the step by step

125
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:22,975
And I know so he was funny and interesting you know when

126
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
Two years ago when we interviewed it when you interview them for the cyberwar episode synesthesia requested to be

127
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Represented by a puppet

128
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:31,935
And

129
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
That was like something that

130
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
No one I've ever thought before and

131
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
People still

132
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
Talk to me about that

133
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,407
Ben interview I mean that was one of the

134
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,455
What are the highlights of my journalism career

135
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,807
I got I got I got to talk to a puppet use my skills and real series way

136
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
But yeah yeah

137
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
Embodies it though right

138
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:57,279
It's like that kind of trolling we got trolled there but it was kind of a trolling I was willing to accept

139
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,143
And it was an interesting sort of execution of old-school hacker culture

140
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
And it was

141
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Literacy

142
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,007
See within that that made me think okay this is

143
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
Is this can't just be

144
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
You know

145
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Some

146
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
Government off in disguise

147
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Is government off

148
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Very rarely have

149
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
Any understanding

150
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Agriculture

151
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
He's also like

152
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
The fact that they stayed around and

153
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,951
Remained on Twitter and try to rally

154
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,023
Troops and you know encourage other people to join the cause

155
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
It does not seem

156
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
I got them I would do

157
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
So yeah it really seemed like

158
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,263
The person was or the people behind them another persona

159
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Truly believe what they were saying

160
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,663
And I've interviewed them many times and I didn't really feel like

161
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
They were different people

162
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,735
I always felt like it was the same people

163
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
But you know it's

164
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,807
Other email or chat

165
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Pretty hard to tell

166
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:58,207
But even your ears after our first conversation and they were able to reference

167
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,047
What we talked about in one of those prayers coming station that was never published

168
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
So they gave me this

169
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
Feeling that yeah it was still the same people

170
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,423
So what are

171
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
Some of the

172
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:09,983
Series

173
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,007
Surrounding

174
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Who

175
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,895
Does this be many and it depends who you ask

176
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
So I think the leading theory still is that

177
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,783
This person or group of people was just an activist

178
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
And the Tylenol stories

179
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,135
Seem to agree with this

180
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,951
Last year we obtained

181
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:34,303
So a report that into telling investigators police investigators

182
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
Wrote after the hack

183
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:41,471
And you know they follow the leads all the trails and eventually they concluded that

184
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,543
The hack was motivated by political

185
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,567
A reason

186
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,407
Batman that likely the hackers were packed

187
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,711
Other than anybody else

188
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,039
The Joe Manor a veteran

189
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
What is Cyprus

190
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,111
Security reporter comes out with a book on

191
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
Wake up with a cow

192
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
Activism

193
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
There is a

194
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
Reference to

195
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
The origins of

196
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
What's in the US intelligence community

197
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
Believes about Phineas

198
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
Joseph presented

199
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
Define theory

200
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,007
He reported that

201
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:20,895
The US intelligence says privately concluded that penis Fisher is likely a Russian government operation

202
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,479
You didn't really go into the details of how they reached a conclusion

203
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,295
But it is a theory that makes some sense

204
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,087
I think it is at least as

205
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Plausible

206
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
That

207
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,439
Phineas Fisher is a Russian operation

208
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
Maybe through a cutout

209
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Then it is that

210
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,559
He she it

211
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,327
Is

212
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
What is xian

213
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,679
Supports to be which is a like a politically-motivated

214
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,727
Immorally Chris eating

215
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,031
Yo super talented hacker

216
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
So it's more like

217
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
You looking at

218
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,359
Destroy the evidence

219
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
I gathered

220
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,431
Alarm in circumstantial

221
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,479
It seems more plausible than instruction

222
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:00,319
And I can go into why but I would say I had sort of worked that out

223
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
On my own and then I ran it by

224
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,487
Some people connected to Western Intel and they're like yeah duh and that you know I don't know

225
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
They didn't give me

226
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,607
Inside information

227
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,887
Except to say

228
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
And I quote one of them

229
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
James Lewis

230
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
Is well connected to Intel folks

231
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
Is saying

232
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
You know that's the assumption

233
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,919
At least because we have seen similar operations from the Russian guard

234
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
So few years ago

235
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,063
A group claiming to be the Cyber caliphate

236
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,343
Accident with his friend

237
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
TV channel

238
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
Tv5monde

239
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
Took it offline

240
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
And then

241
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
On Twitter this group claimed responsibility

242
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,191
Years later though investigators have concluded that the Cyber caliphate was just a fake

243
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,311
Persona created by apt28 which is Russian intelligence

244
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,199
Something similar happened with group that called themselves the Yemen cyber Army

245
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
Saudi company

246
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,575
And then they came out and claimed that they were like

247
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
I'm sort of a yemeni

248
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
Writing Center

249
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Organization

250
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
But then again it turned out that

251
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,863
He was actually again the Russian government so this is dessert

252
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
Strategy that employed before

253
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,495
So it does, it is possible it makes them sad

254
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:26,079
What doesn't add up completely is that

255
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Men

256
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:31,455
Claims that finishes last hacked which was against the Turkish

257
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Green Party

258
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
AKP

259
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Shows that

260
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
Penis fish write some sort of

261
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,183
Is aligned with Russian government interest

262
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
That that hack was

263
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,119
A strange and also at the time I'm not sure that turkey in rush hour on the best terms

264
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,423
I just I think the motive is

265
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,471
It's not enough to prove that

266
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,007
So I mean have you

267
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Did you talk to

268
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
Chris Fisher recently and asked

269
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,967
After the book came out and I saw that paragraph I emailed them immediately and asked a what

270
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,247
What's up have you seen this

271
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,807
What are your thoughts I'd be curious to know why you think

272
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,367
And they responded that

273
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,391
I was

274
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,671
Ridiculous

275
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
They said that it was almost

276
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
So dumb that it didn't

277
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
Deserve a response

278
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,143
But eventually they explain that the theory just doesn't add up because

279
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,983
At the time Russia and Turkey you were not on good terms

280
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:32,383
And it just didn't make sense for the hack to be politically motivated in that sense from the Russian perspective

281
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,711
And they also explain how the

282
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,783
Controversial emails that sort of

283
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,831
Docksta bunch of them

284
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,647
Turkish women ended up on weekly

285
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,743
Beneficial said that they share the emails with

286
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,535
Someone in rojava

287
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,607
Which is an autonomous region between turkey and Russia

288
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
Bat penis Fisher

289
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
Reports because they're like I don't care

290
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,007
And the goal that was

291
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,359
For them to look at the emails to see if there was anything in useful for their cause

292
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:10,271
What happened was that penis Fisher is contacting version of a shed than with somebody else who had contact with WikiLeaks

293
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:15,391
With the request not to publish anything until they told them to do so

294
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,695
Wikileaks ignored

295
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
And after the

296
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
Elko

297
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
That summer they just published everything

298
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,167
Which was not what answer to why nor what is contactor in Rwanda

299
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,263
Sort of contradicts the theory that

300
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
He was just working for the Russian government trying to

301
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,431
Tiffany sister give us a statement

302
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,575
Yes Phoenix Fisher agreed to respond to Joseph's men's reporting

303
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,415
On the condition that we got someone with a fake Russian accent

304
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
To read this message

305
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,279
Knock knock not quite a puppet this time

306
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,351
Yeah hard to see the puppet on Apopka

307
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,911
Okay so without further ado

308
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Here is

309
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
Phineas Fisher State my

310
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
In a heavy Russian

311
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Very

312
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,383
Important contacts

313
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,199
No one talked about

314
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,759
Is that a year earlier

315
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
Russian turkey

316
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
Diplomatic incident

317
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,695
Which had been entirely resolved before the heck

318
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
Happened

319
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,279
So I'm not really sure what my point was that to us

320
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,839
But anyway Russia

321
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,703
Was AKP strongest supporters during and after the coup attempt

322
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,007
So why would you want to attack

323
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,031
AKP

324
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,687
Because we all know Russians are tricky bastards that like to play both sides and stuff.

325
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
The most logical explanation

326
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
It's clearly Russia stuck in the Cold War I guess he never got the memo that America

327
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,439
Boogeyman is Adams

328
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
Russians

329
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
Personally

330
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
I feel

331
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
Like I'm more of a Charming chicken

332
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Turn the fancy bear

333
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
You know I think

334
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,151
The thing about Phineas Fisher to me that's the most interesting it's just a mystery

335
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
It service Phantom quality

336
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,271
It's almost as if I kind of like

337
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
As a story

338
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,623
Dennis Fisher is being accused of being a Russian hacker

339
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
Continues with this

340
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
Hacker anarchic

341
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
Legends

342
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,375
Yeah I think on one hand I would love to know who finis Fisher is

343
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
But on the other hand it's such a better story if we never do

344
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
No

345
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
Satoshi nakamoto you know it's like

346
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,311
It's a mystery.

347
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:46,175
Listen to itself and the leave the door open for so many series and accusation

348
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,807
And that is the most interesting part of the story at this point to know the computer hacking hacking team hacks for

349
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
Very important but what

350
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
Really matters now is

351
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,743
And this person is still around and despite having embarrassed

352
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
Two companies that are you know very powerful

353
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,119
Customers and connections all over the world

354
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,727
This person or people are still around you know

355
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
Typing on keyboard ready to strike

356
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Again

357
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
There's something very Robinhood about it

358
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
Yeah for sure and

359
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
That is something that

360
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
Doesn't happen very often anymore in the world

361
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,039
No no it doesn't

362
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Well thank you for answer

363
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Thank you hun

364
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
This week's episode was edited and recorded by Andrew bercik produced by Lorenzo franceschi

365
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,703
Hosted by Yours Truly then McCoo and the voice actor we used his name is moti margolin

366
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:46,079
Shut off to him for being the voice of an attacker will see you next week
