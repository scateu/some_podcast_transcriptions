You obviously get lots of tips and lots of

17
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,080
Source is coming Tuesday

18
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
Information

19
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
How did you first

20
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,176
Uncover

21
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
The story

22
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
About

23
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
Good question

24
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,368
I've been following jigsaw for a while now

25
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,416
Probably like 5 or 6

26
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,184
Axios

27
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,768
Because I always thought they were a very interesting company

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,376
And for those of you who haven't heard about jigsaw jigsaw is basically

29
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,984
Fing Fang / incubator within Google that does

30
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
Both studies and great products

31
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:21,824
2

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,872
Essentially make the internet better

33
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,456
So we talkin about you know anti-censorship products

34
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
Vpns for

35
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
Communities at risk

36
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,624
Like you know Iranians or Chinese people

37
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
Stop light

38
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
No research on

39
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,000
Resume online

40
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
Disinformation and stuff like that

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,376
So basically this is a company that has a very

42
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,728
Amazing public profile remember I've heard about jigsaw it's always been

43
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
Advertising itself

44
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
Like internet savior

45
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,616
Yeah pretty much that that is a very good way to put it

46
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,432
And ever since they were born which is

47
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
2010

48
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
Almost 10 years ago

49
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,296
At the time they were call Google ideas but

50
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
Same group

51
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
Agave Brandon to jigsaw in mm

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
15 / 16

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
When

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,488
Google reorganizes alphabet

55
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
Yeah they've always been in the news

56
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
Are there

57
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
Very out there project

58
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,680
Standby out there meaning like idealistic and

59
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,728
You know overly positive project

60
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
901

61
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
Argues that

62
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,568
Trying to find solutions to

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,616
Did us attacks against journalists

64
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Is bad

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
That is a great

66
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,432
Initiative

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
And have done some good work

68
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,576
But we heard a few months ago was that behind the scenes

69
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,392
In a within the team within the company

70
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,696
People are actually very unhappy

71
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
And a lot of people had left over the years for various reasons and obviously we can't say that I've run is left

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
Because they hated working there

73
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,496
But there's definitely a large chunk of people who left

74
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,264
Because of that reason

75
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
And moreover

76
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,104
Google enlarge

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
I've known that

78
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
The team has been mismanaged

79
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
And the employees that I complain

80
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,504
4 years

81
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
And

82
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
As you can tell Google

83
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,856
Hasn't done anything about it

84
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
What you're saying is

85
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,976
You found at this company that's revered publicly

86
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
Behind closed doors actually is this

87
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,839
Friday mismanaged

88
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,119
Its employees have

89
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
Serious issues

90
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
The workplace

91
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,983
And let's also

92
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,055
It brings back to cyber this is a company that works with internet

93
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
They work with International governments

94
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:37,503
They partnered with ngos that though they do a lot of interesting infosec work like

95
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,295
Citizen lab for example

96
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
Access now

97
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,975
Basically an NGO that you can think of that doesn't need digital rice or Internet activism work

98
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
They partnered with our list

99
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
Baidu

100
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
So this is something you heard rumors of

101
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
For a little while and I mean to this pick up steam right around the time of what's a some of the emerging me to reporting that it happened

102
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,799
There may be some me-too stories we don't know about

103
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
We don't have any evidence of it

104
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,175
The story is more about toxic workplace culture

105
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
Core management

106
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,599
People that feel like their projects are going nowhere

107
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,439
Also there's there was definitely a widespread feeling

108
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,999
And the priorities of the management was

109
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
2

110
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Got press

111
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
And good PR other than actually do good work

112
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
Does the case that we discussed in the story

113
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,983
What are jigsaw partnered with citizen lab

114
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
2017

115
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
Or something called this

116
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
Security planner

117
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:38,943
And these are actually really good initiative aware

118
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
They created a website that

119
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,271
Teaches people out of

120
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Think about

121
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,367
Security and how to think about protecting themselves online

122
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,207
But there was a little bit of a controversy at the end of the project

123
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
Before it was launched

124
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Because apparently

125
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,351
Jake Owen who is the CEO of Jigsaw and

126
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
I'm depressed

127
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,399
Habitat

128
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
In the beginning

129
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
Was angry about

130
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
The fact that

131
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
Jigsaws logo was not

132
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
Going to be on the homepage

133
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,151
Security Planet Project

134
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:12,735
And sort of got mad about it and

135
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
At some point you know

136
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Fought with

137
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:16,831
Shenzhen Library

138
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,111
Jigsaw

139
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:18,879
About this

140
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,207
And our sources were like you know it felt like

141
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Baseball

142
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
Better busy

143
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,583
Call and say it's not worth helping people if we don't get credit

144
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,191
And this is just an example like all my sources pretty much Echo this

145
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:37,055
Everyone feels very itchy about coins focus on VR

146
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,871
There is a wallet out of his office at the

147
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
Jigsaw office

148
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,919
With

149
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,271
Framed newspaper and magazine clips about colors that Dick's has gone

150
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,599
Which you know I'm sure happens in all the places

151
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,159
I don't have any evidence that happened to Google

152
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
It's kind of weird

153
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
And most importantly the employees there

154
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
Like me or my opinion doesn't matter

155
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,607
People want their think it's really weird

156
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
That they just talk

157
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
Prescott

158
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
And who is Jared

159
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
My name is a jerk

160
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
The alphabet

161
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,175
And I also work as a chief adviser to the alphabet executive chairman

162
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
But more than that I'm just really in

163
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
Interested in the Nexus

164
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,575
Geopolitics and Technology something which I think has been

165
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
Convergence

166
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,439
For more than a decade and we're finally in this moment where everybody's waking up

167
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Jake Owen start his career

168
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,023
Condoleezza Rice

169
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
State Department

170
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,863
Bush the Bush Administration

171
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,911
And then stayed

172
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:38,751
When Hillary Clinton took over after Obama won his first

173
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,847
And then present and when he left

174
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:44,127
The state department

175
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
He was tapped

176
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,687
To have this new

177
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Cool thing that Google which was Google ID

178
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
The idea behind Google ideas

179
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
Was

180
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
Essential E2

181
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,999
Look at some of the biggest security challenges in the world through the lens of Technology

182
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
And at the time

183
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
Before our team

184
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:10,751
Add improper engineering resources before we became a technology organization I'm we were really just trying to

185
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Understanding

186
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
And think about

187
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,895
How technology played a role in them and

188
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
How that affected

189
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
A company's decision making

190
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,527
I don't know exactly how this came to be but

191
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
Basically it sounds like Eric Smith

192
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
Who are the time was Google CEO

193
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,951
I told Jared hey do you want to

194
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
Have a team within Google

195
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,303
Tommy Sotomayor think tank with in Google to

196
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
You know Tagalog is amazing

197
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
And is

198
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Really tough challenge

199
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,239
And when I started it was a very small team

200
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,567
When it started they didn't even have an engineer

201
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,711
It was really bootstrapped by colon and a couple of other people that are still there

202
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:55,807
Any quickly grew although it's never been bigger than

203
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
50 or 40 people

204
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
You know for Google did you still

205
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,207
A small team has male initiative

206
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,767
Adam Gardens so much good price over the years

207
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,071
You know if you Google jigsaw

208
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
Google News

209
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,959
You'll find what kind of Dino magazine articles

210
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,055
News articles talking about their initiatives

211
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,615
Sota case of Justice company being a lot of bark

212
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
But not really much bite

213
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,223
Yeah there's a lot of that to like even people within

214
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,783
Jigsaw of both current and former employees

215
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,111
Have told that they feel that they have and we achieved much

216
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Antonio's

217
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,951
And to be fair these are problems that really hard

218
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Solve don't seem

219
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
Yeah actually that's one what

220
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,887
That's exactly what our sources said like these are impossible problem to solve

221
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
Seoul measuring progress in measuring

222
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,471
Assassin's really hard

223
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:52,383
So we shouldn't be too tough on them for this because they deserve credit for at least trying right Facebook doesn't have a t

224
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
Teen like this apple doesn't have a thing like this

225
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
Microsoft doesn't have a thing like this

226
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527
At the very least they're making a

227
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Even if

228
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Probably

229
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Pretty small

230
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
The words of the most shocking

231
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
Revelations that

232
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
You found from the

233
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:05,951
Story when you were due

234
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
We can't discuss overly specific

235
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,583
Stories because our sources were very careful

236
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,703
They're all worried about getting either soothe or

237
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
Hino retaliated against

238
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,359
Yeah that that says a lot already

239
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
Most

240
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:30,015
Stories were like managers taking credit for their employees work inappropriate comments

241
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,599
Dismissive comments

242
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,231
Toward the population than people that are actually in theory the targets of their work

243
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
So

244
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
You know minorities or

245
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
People in the Middle East

246
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
People in Africa stuff like that

247
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,911
A general like

248
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Lack of awareness

249
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,215
I guess for

250
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
Stop that they actually should be

251
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:57,407
More careful with so it's it's a lot about a lot of these like little things that overall make you think that

252
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
The people who lead the team

253
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Dan Marino

254
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
And Company brass

255
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
Not particularly good

256
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Two women either

257
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,111
Yes there's something we talked about in the story that

258
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,439
It's basically at some point over the last 3 years

259
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,815
So many women like felt mistreated and undervalued

260
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
Bad sometimes they would like

261
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,631
Cry

262
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,911
In the bathrooms

263
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,567
And at some point he would have been so often that the women at jigsaw put in the bathroom store

264
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
I can't

265
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
2

266
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,271
I can recover after crying so like you know much driving cream mascara and other like stop to us

267
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Essentially hive

268
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
The fact that you cry during work

269
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Go back to

270
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,391
If that's without anyone notice

271
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,719
I got to say when it when I think about jigsaw and I think about

272
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
CEO

273
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
I think to myself

274
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:48,607
You know this is a company that has all of the telltale signs

275
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Having connection

276
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
The Beltway

277
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Intelligent

278
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,007
Community do you think that it is that an allegation has been thrown around

279
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,847
It's definitely something that a lot of people in the NGO world have wondered about

280
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:04,223
And by that I mean people that I've worked either with Jigsaw alongside jigsaw or Ave

281
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,271
Have some awareness of jigs

282
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,903
The fact that corn comes from another state department and the one of his

283
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
Right hand people

284
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
Stop Carpenter also the former diplomat

285
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
In the US government

286
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,095
As always raise red flag

287
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,631
In some circles

288
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
And also there is

289
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,959
Nissan Chester

290
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,007
You know it would be unfair to just point it there

291
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Resume

292
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,359
Because they are just because you're in the state department doesn't make you

293
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
CIA

294
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
But there have been weird cases and we are the occurrences that are worth like pointing out so far

295
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,135
Temple in early 2018 Vista Higher the Crown Prince of Jordan

296
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
Or a job or an internship

297
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:48,255
Didn't call an internship but they hide them for 3 months

298
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
How to work a jig sizes

299
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
Security analyst

300
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
And

301
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,703
I'm not a Jordanian politics axberg but officer Jordan is

302
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
An important Ally

303
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
As the United States in the Middle East

304
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,151
It has a pretty good surveillance

305
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,711
System within its Country and

306
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:11,807
It's intelligence apparatus is very tied to the American intelligence

307
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:16,671
I need to be held by some local jordanians whoever had to you know that they're like

308
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
Applications Center in Suffolk

309
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,095
And this was not known until we revealed it was very careful not to reveal this

310
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,655
Like when they emailed the whole staff

311
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,239
Saying please welcome the Crown Prince

312
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
Is going to start in a few weeks by the block

313
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,615
Someone asked who's is confidential and

314
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
One of the managers was like yeah please what would rather

315
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
Keep This Confidential for now

316
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,783
And there was even like

317
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
I mean this email is super we are like the

318
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,367
The most like

319
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
He prefers to be called

320
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Hussein

321
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,535
And please don't mind the security detail outside of the Google off

322
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
So it's like

323
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
We ask Pixar like why did you hire this person

324
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,495
What was he doing what were these qualifications and

325
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
The response was

326
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
We cannot talk about employee matters

327
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,151
Just thought of a typical

328
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
Is a typical response when you don't want to talk about something

329
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,111
Yeah I mean as I said like they did not announce it a time there's no like

330
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:22,719
Almost no public trail of it and yet and yet they're still announcing an internal

331
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,279
I don't know exactly why they decided to announce

332
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,583
Internally I think employees would have noticed

333
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
First of all

334
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
Also I think they wanted to preempt

335
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
Internal controversy

336
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,567
Because the employees who are there the time who told me about the

337
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
Crown Prince of Jordan working there

338
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
Lorelei confused what I why is this

339
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,943
This guy working here

340
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,479
What's going on did you get a

341
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,503
Job interview

342
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,319
Did you get the same job interview I got because

343
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,903
You know it says people may know go ahead with Google is not easy

344
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
Have to go through a lot of

345
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
Interviews the process

346
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,279
Such as long as complicated

347
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,095
Yeah it's pretty well known to be a very tough place

348
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
I got a job

349
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
And I think at some point

350
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,031
The I don't know if it wasn't all in the meeting or in some internal communication but

351
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:13,663
One of the jigsaw managers was like yeah you did an interview we interview him

352
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,967
In his helicopter on some trip

353
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Vancouver Lake

354
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Well

355
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:19,807
Does that mean

356
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
Luna Park

357
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
A few months ago

358
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,463
So Google and jigsaw reach out to a bunch of ngos at some point last year

359
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
And they were like we have a lot of

360
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:33,631
Security keys made by Google that we would like to send two countries where there's a lot of

361
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
Government

362
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,167
Hawking dissident

363
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:38,751
So the idea was to send in security keys

364
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
To make the decisions on Human Rights Act

365
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:48,735
And once the ngos responded saying this sounds good

366
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
Google Center in India

367
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
That was like

368
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,415
You can receive this you can send them to the account trees

369
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
Around the world but

370
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,279
Do not send them to North Korea Iran Syria

371
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,119
Cuba and other countries and obviously the reason for that is

372
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
The sanctions regime in the US

373
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:12,287
D&J was also like you cannot talk about the existence of the security keys with people there

374
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,591
And it's like not a lawyer and sanctions

375
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,383
You know are very tough I understand that

376
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943
This contributes to

377
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
A lot of the NGO world

378
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,807
Being very skeptical of jigsaws actual intent

379
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Tencent

380
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,367
Are you still at the actress

381
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,647
The question like this is like

382
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,951
She saw it coming from a company like Google

383
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
Which is hacked by China

384
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,839
And still continue to pursue the Chinese market

385
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,911
For a long time right when when that happened which was

386
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
The so-called

387
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
Aurora

388
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
HAC

389
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,543
They

390
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:48,127
Did the Chinese market they resurrected there

391
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,687
Chinese search engine to Hong Kong and stuff like that

392
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,247
And for years over visit like we'll never go back

393
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
As we know thanks to the intercept

394
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
Amazing Scoops last year

395
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
They are

396
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Back in time

397
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,695
Yeah they're reading about it seriously now

398
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,535
And it's probably going to happen although it does seem that internal

399
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Protoss

400
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
An internal

401
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,935
The internal strife that these regulations cause

402
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
At least slow them down

403
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:17,311
It kind of bags we question right you know you see how

404
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
Many of the Google employees that

405
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Striking

406
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
Google was violating its

407
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
When will it stop

408
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,503
Your tenants

409
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
To not be evil

410
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
But

411
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,855
It's interesting to meet you CDs

412
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,159
This infrastructure that has become Google and then

413
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Has become these come

414
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Jigsaw

415
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
They're so big they're so powerful

416
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
So much money

417
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
They almost seem like State actors now

418
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:46,239
And when they on the one hand say like we're trying to really be amazing on the internet and solve units

419
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
Major problems

420
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,311
Like this information online terrorism

421
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
Etc etc

422
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,383
And then on the one hand there

423
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
You know

424
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
Trying to get into the Chinese market or just at the US are backing the Saudi regime where which sanctioned

425
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,623
Decapitation in murder of a journalist

426
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,671
And then on the other hand

427
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,439
Preaching from the

428
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Pedestal

429
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
I mean Apes

430
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
It's sort of this obvious

431
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,351
Hypocrisy

432
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,143
Goes on in our society nowadays

433
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,239
It also shows just how powerful these companies are now that we actually can help

434
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Hold on to this

435
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
I mean jigsaw itself is basically

436
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,615
Start of a diplomatic arm of

437
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,431
Google maybe that's not how they would describe themselves

438
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,991
I know if anyone has ever described in that way but

439
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:34,111
Looking good newsmaker there like they're you know what is so bad guys

440
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Lilia former diplomat

441
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695
And they

442
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Hino de deus

443
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Stop at

444
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Define of the plumber

445
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
You know they go to Davos

446
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,471
And like meeting with other countries and governments and they know that

447
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,775
A royal family member on their team

448
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
It's just

449
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,335
And that's the only one we know

450
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
Yeah and so it's like really like

451
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,991
The question is what are you doing what is the actual goal and you know I don't want to go all conspiracy

452
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Fury

453
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
Here I don't think that

454
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,599
You know I don't think they passed the data to the

455
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
The CIA the song X

456
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Say

457
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,183
It's like why you are saying that

458
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
Now these companies like Microsoft

459
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,767
Something Google are so big that they busy

460
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Can do

461
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,583
Are posted on foreign policy goals

462
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
It's insane

463
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,655
That's a good way to put it

464
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
You know what

465
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,471
So one final question I want for you

466
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,031
The story doesn't scream Lorenzo

467
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,567
Francesca Bakery

468
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,847
In like the perfect way

469
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,175
Because you know usually you were putting on hacks and breach

470
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
But this is you know this is workplace culture this is

471
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,575
Looking at Google and saying you know that I was going either one says they are

472
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,647
Why is this was it so important to use nympho

473
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Reported to report

474
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,255
Motherboard Vice

475
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,839
Braids large we've been focusing a lot on

476
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,399
Labor issues labor and tok

477
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
And

478
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,727
To me this was

479
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
Another example of

480
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
Google search

481
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,943
Reality behind-the-scenes ripe for years companies that Google and Facebook

482
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
Have looked

483
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,479
It looks like

484
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
Havens of amazing

485
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
Working condition

486
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,367
Casino that free food

487
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Have a bite

488
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Colorful by

489
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,743
Bikes that you can use to walk around

490
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Move around the campus

491
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,327
And in reality it's

492
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
Their offices

493
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
Much like many other

494
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
That's right with the

495
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,447
Bad Bosses

496
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,263
Crappy working conditions and stuff like that

497
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
And also in this particular case

498
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
He was really like

499
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,663
Canada Public Image that

500
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,479
Jigsaw and Google we're projecting

501
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
Corso Mastiff

502
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,807
And the reality

503
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
Like in the story we have

504
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
A few quotes

505
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
Scrum

506
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Internal forum

507
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,743
Where women engineers at Google disc

508
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Jigsaw

509
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,327
And at one point one of them

510
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
Address employee says

511
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
Social justice

512
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
Is initial waiting

513
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Jigsaw

514
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
And I don't trust chicks

515
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
Just saw a star

516
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,543
And it's like

517
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,847
This is the team that should actually get

518
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
This kind of issues right there

519
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:08,991
They're basically going to sign for it yeah they're designing products for

520
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,039
Places like Iran and Syria

521
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,184
Other countries where you know basic human rights are violated and

522
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,512
Seems like they're not respecting their own workers rights

523
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,048
Well thank you for

524
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,352
Checking your producers had at the door

525
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:30,240
The interview getting grilled by Yours Truly we will be back next week

526
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:36,640
This week's episode was recorded in edited by Dean white produced by Lorenzo franceschi VK

527
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:43,040
Hosted by me and Max who you'll be hearing from us next week
