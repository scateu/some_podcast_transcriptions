00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Eagle One

00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Package being delivered fancy bear ATT 10 Lazarus group

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:35,328
Charming kitten these are all the names given to government hacker groups in did you pay any attention to cybersecurity

5
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:41,216
Russian hackers Chinese hackers and groups are usually called apts

6
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,752
Government-sponsored hackers

7
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
Today Department of Justice is announcing of to hackers associated with the Chinese guy

8
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:55,552
The FBI suspect the hack was perpetrated by Russian intelligence in an effort to elect Donald Trump

9
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,952
All we know is that the hacking group responsible go by the names cozy

10
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:08,352
Bear and fancy bear cyber team known as fancy bear has also gone up

11
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,448
Target in Europe and Russia this week were talking with Eva galperin

12
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
The director of cyber-security with the Electronic Frontier Foundation

13
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
Show me state Hackers from Oliver every corner of the globe because countries everywhere are growing their cyber armies

14
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:31,648
There's no signs that's going down I'm National Security reporter Ben McCune and this is side

15
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,352
So pretty crazy

16
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
Few weeks in apt line

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
Just like every other week you

18
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,032
Stop just to start this off can you just tell me what does a p

19
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,592
Apt stands for advanced

20
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Persist

21
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
Threat

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,688
And is usually understood

23
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
2 min

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
State actors

25
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,296
Though honestly

26
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
Plenty of other groups could probably

27
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Describe

28
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
Persistent

29
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
Abt's are are usually trotted out sort of in contrast

30
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
To criminal groups

31
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
That are doing

32
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
Celeste Target

33
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,704
Why do people call advanced persistent threat

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,472
For what

35
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Consternation

36
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,080
So the the thing that is generally thought

37
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,688
Distinguish nation-state actors from non nation state actors

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
And I will

39
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,272
Not pause

40
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,552
To go on a rant

41
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
Stolen directly

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
Amara town

43
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
About why we shouldn't call him dick

44
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,976
Is a doctor's there just a doctor's nation state has burst

45
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
Specific meaning in political science

46
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
But this is what we do

47
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Go ahead and taking it up

48
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
It just sounds

49
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,216
So the

50
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
The ways in which state Act

51
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
Thought to be different

52
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Criminals

53
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
Is that there

54
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,616
Schools are differ

55
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,944
So they have a

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
Group of people

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
Coup

58
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,064
Full-time job is

59
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,672
Breaking into the targets devices or accounts

60
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,280
Stay if you start work in the morning they finish work in the evenings they have

61
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,560
I accessed

62
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
No more advance

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,888
Twirling because they have more money

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
I am

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
They are willing to be

66
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
T-shirts

67
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
Which is one of the reasons why it is called a persistent threat

68
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,920
So it's a combination of the fancier tooling and patience

69
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,480
Along with us

70
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,576
Tendency you to be very narrowly targeted and therefore

71
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,856
Harder to find

72
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,184
I'm busy that's exactly it right there their government hackers

73
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,720
That there

74
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,744
Exact job

75
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
The shop the office

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Every single day

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Go after a Target

78
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,352
Until you

79
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,632
Obtain what you need

80
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
And then go home

81
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
Isn't that kind of

82
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Interesting things

83
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
You know people's perceptions

84
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,056
Of what

85
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104
Cyber armies are these

86
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Government hackers

87
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,712
It seems a lot more kind of fancy and clandestine

88
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
China for example

89
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Dave

90
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,832
Track somebody's

91
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Chinese government hackers

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
And they see that they are extremely active between 9 to 5

93
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
Beijing time

94
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,791
I'm a break at lunch

95
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
Yep that this is just somebody's job

96
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,679
On one hand that makes

97
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
It

98
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
Carter 2

99
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
To protect yourself against

100
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,407
Because I'll keep coming at you until until they gain an advantage

101
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,479
And on the other hands there

102
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,039
Not that ideologically invested

103
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,343
And in owning you

104
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
They're just doing it for work

105
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
But one of the ways in which

106
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
State actors are considered

107
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Very different from criminals

108
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,303
Is that they're harder to protect against

109
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:56,959
And the reason that they're harder to protect against does not only because of their fancy or Cooling and potentially willingness to spend

110
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
More money on

111
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
Uncompromising the a specific Target

112
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:07,967
But also because you can't just use the security posture of

113
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,039
Outrunning the other guy and outrun the bear

114
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,623
I if you specifically are being targeted that you don't

115
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,951
You can't just make yourself a harder Target

116
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
Then

117
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Other acts

118
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,327
Or other journalists and think that that's going to be enough

119
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
I am that's one of the ways in which

120
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
ABC's are differ

121
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
Frank from trying to protect yourself

122
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
And you're also dealing with an adversary that you

123
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,079
Likely will never apprehended has the full protection

124
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,359
State like

125
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
I say China or Russia

126
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,199
Yeah I mean what are you what are you going to do

127
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,783
Doj issues indictments

128
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,087
BJ's against Pacific Russian hackers

129
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:49,183
Pacific Chinese hackers add it's unlikely to come to anything

130
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,023
And people involved in similar hacking

131
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,815
In the United States against

132
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:58,911
Target's outside of the United States think that this sets a terrible precedent

133
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,727
Because they all imagine indictments coming down

134
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
Name exam

135
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
In in other countries and it's not unreasonable to think that this is not a president that the US should be say

136
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,735
And to be really simple about what's the like

137
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
Top 10 nation-state hacking

138
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,343
What are the who's the most active

139
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
Who's the most advanced

140
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,183
Who does the things that you know Uke

141
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:21,951
Say

142
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,999
It's sort of advancing this whole geopolitical

143
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,279
Space online

144
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,583
Well it really depends on what you mean by that

145
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:33,727
It turns out that you don't have to be super advanced in order in order to compromise most Target

146
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,079
Generally five eyes countries Plus

147
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,871
China

148
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
Israel

149
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
And I would say Russia

150
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
Are are

151
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,295
Thought to be the most

152
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Takeda.

153
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,951
We're definitely thought to be sort of at the at the Leading Edge

154
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
Of nation-state espionage

155
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,399
Others the famous James mickens quote in which he goes on and on about how old you are if you go up against the Mossad

156
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
So

157
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
Israel is considered to be

158
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
Tremendously advance

159
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,799
Highly determined

160
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
If your

161
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,199
If your attacker is the NSA

162
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Do you have some

163
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,015
You have some very serious concern

164
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,391
You can mostly need to concern yourself with mitigation rather than being able to keep everything

165
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Completely under wraps

166
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
So

167
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,255
Are generally thought to be the most

168
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,303
Advanced doctor's but it turns out that you don't have to

169
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
To be varied

170
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
Eastern Oregon

171
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:32,607
Successful

172
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
The wrong for example is

173
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,727
Tremendously prolific when it comes

174
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,823
To test phishing campaigns and campaigns of malware

175
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,407
The same goes for

176
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,015
Ethiopia which we don't normally think of is as a major cyber actor

177
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,623
As far as we can tell Ethiopia Ethiopian government the previous Ethiopian government

178
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
I bought just about every

179
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:03,839
Commercial hacking tools that you can possibly get your hands on and had attempted to use them against

180
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
The opposition

181
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
Ever since the change in government

182
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,007
And not any Pio Pio we expect to see that sort of calm down a bit

183
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,103
We've also seen everything UAE

184
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
Saudi Arabia

185
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
Bob Crane

186
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
I'll add it

187
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
Same goes

188
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:22,015
Score for Mexico

189
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
I've used these are all sort of

190
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
Lesser

191
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,695
Last of Us Takeda doctors but they have managed to be

192
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Successful

193
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,815
Genesis tinting series that you know you look at the Middle East right now and some of those countries

194
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,839
Such as.

195
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Are the countries that actually

196
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,935
Seminole eating arms buyers

197
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
In the entire world

198
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
Actual kinetic weaponry

199
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,775
We're also seeing service

200
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Similar of

201
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
Malware and espionage

202
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
Tools in exact

203
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Same area

204
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
Not everybody who is who's running around

205
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Stockpiling

206
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:58,111
Military weapons is necessarily upping their cyber-espionage game

207
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
But for political reasons

208
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:06,047
In the in the Gulf you've definitely seen an uptick in both of these lines

209
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
Quite simply because

210
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,399
Espionage

211
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:13,983
Goes goes hand-in-hand with kinetic Warfare

212
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,079
And so is considered to be EPO part of part of the Pikachu

213
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:23,711
So when you are engaged in kinetic Warfare you also want to know what the

214
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
What your opponents are doing

215
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,063
Because it allows you to be more effective fiction

216
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:35,487
If you are in a in a position as a state where you're trying to say avoid kinetic Warfare

217
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,559
Espionage is also considered to be useful

218
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
Way of approaching

219
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
The art of espionage

220
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:49,055
Which is an argument that Espionage prevents Warfare igneo by allowing

221
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,847
States to have

222
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
Soda

223
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
Air release valve

224
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,735
I so that they have option

225
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
Instead of

226
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,599
Just blowing each other up

227
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
That I buy this argue

228
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
But

229
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
Do think that states by

230
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,023
Into it and so they invest very heavily in a

231
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
Sweetheart

232
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,119
When they're gearing up for chemical warfare or if they're in the middle of it

233
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,471
I thought I believe us considers the cybers

234
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
To be another

235
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Theater of war

236
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
Well I mean that kind of goes to the hole

237
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
The holster of uproar

238
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
Hysteria around Russia

239
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,455
Sort of

240
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Almost god-like power

241
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
State Government whenever

242
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,719
Now we pause for me to laugh

243
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,327
Yes using the mighty powers of fishing John podesta

244
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,167
Russian government has managed

245
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
Shoe high back in control of Our Lives

246
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
That is a

247
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
Tremendous exaggeration

248
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,591
On what hand

249
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,991
Russian and Ukrainian and other post-soviet actors are extremely Act

250
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Active in the space

251
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,039
Boost

252
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,831
In terms of

253
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
State espionage

254
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
Spying on

255
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
Each other and spying on

256
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,231
United States like the

257
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,279
Russian Ukrainian spy

258
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Is

259
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,351
Dizzying if you try to keep track of it

260
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
But also

261
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,263
They have a long history of criminal Acts

262
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,567
There are a lot of

263
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,151
Of cybercriminals breeding inside of the post-soviet states

264
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,223
And in Russia at least were very long time it was understood

265
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,831
That if you wanted to engage in an online crime

266
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,975
That as long as you weren't ripping off Russians the rest of the world was fair game and you would have a safe place to sit

267
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
As far as I know that is

268
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,863
Nobody sent me a memo on

269
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:54,239
Like what Russian cyber crime is up to but I tried and I tried to keep an eye on it

270
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
And

271
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
Because of that understanding

272
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
There is a

273
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:06,271
There is a large number of criminals with considerable expertise

274
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,295
Study is

275
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
That the states were able to draw

276
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,487
Yeah sort of that pooling of talent that happens in Russia where there's legitimate evidence out there so

277
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
Suggesting the UEFA

278
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
SP operate

279
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
It's somebody's clandestine

280
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Sites where they're able to

281
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
To get some of these

282
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Blackhat

283
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,423
Some of their bidding

284
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,727
And it's a great way to

285
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
Make sure the United States

286
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,823
What's your kind of nose

287
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
It's your

288
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,407
You know we didn't really section at 1 so

289
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
So sorry

290
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
It allows

291
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
It allows the rush

292
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,295
Russian government to have a sort of

293
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,831
Plausible deniability

294
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,439
But there's also just a whole question of how plausibly deniable

295
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,719
Do they want to get

296
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,511
These days

297
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,351
You you can actually fairly strong attribution and

298
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,167
It's not like anything's going to happen to Russian

299
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,239
Inside of Russia travel to the United States

300
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
There are no real consequence

301
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
The difference

302
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
Between what states

303
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,663
2010

304
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,687
Presents

305
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,711
Is just

306
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,575
You know the sheer proliferation of these agencies now and these different governments that

307
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Have

308
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,135
This new capability

309
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
Online

310
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,487
Or do you think that this is something that's always been around and

311
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,023
It's just sort of evolving

312
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
Just like

313
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
Every other country

314
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Have had the internet

315
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,959
I do think that the extent to which

316
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
State espionage

317
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
Become less

318
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Expensive

319
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
And especially digital Espionage has become

320
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
Inexpensive

321
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
To the point where you can

322
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,319
Contact a company like NSO group in Israel or hacking team in Milan

323
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,879
And for a few hundred thousand dollars

324
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,671
Cats get access

325
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
2

326
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
Target's mobile phones

327
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,535
You're definitely seeing this

328
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:58,911
Spread among countries that are not thought to be on The Cutting Edge of espionage

329
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:03,775
Big thing that has really changed since approximately 2010

330
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,383
I is is not that the capabilities has have improved

331
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
It's the

332
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:14,015
Your average person was likely to be a Target is carrying a tracking device

333
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,623
The proliferation of the mobile phone

334
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
Has really changed every

335
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
Because it's such an incredibly tempting Target

336
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,559
Because I carry such a wealth of the

337
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,095
About

338
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,911
People that you might want to know

339
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
And

340
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
As a result

341
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,495
There's a

342
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
Just a lot more to spy

343
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
Well that's a neck

344
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Extremely depressed

345
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
I should bring the Christmas

346
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:46,527
I mean I don't get to choose just

347
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:51,647
Did proliferation of intelligence sources

348
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
You know it in

349
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,487
2007 or 2008

350
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Are Target

351
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
Platform was

352
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Three devices in the you know you going to see

353
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,607
You go after somebody

354
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,887
Post Addison

355
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
And in the present time and you have 18 device

356
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
This is where you can get into their Wi-Fi

357
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
Absolutely

358
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,335
Even more disturbing than people are installing things like Alexa

359
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,199
So now you have this sort of always on listening device

360
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,063
Turn your music on your lights on and off

361
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
I read a story this morning about a guy who had the requested all of his information from a man

362
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
DPR

363
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,095
And Amazon accidentally sent him the voice recordings

364
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
From some other user who had an Alexa

365
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
I did not have Alexa

366
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,543
Absolutely knew that the Alexa recordings were not him

367
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,079
And you could find out a lot of it

368
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
Extremely personal stuff about this guy

369
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,663
Based on that

370
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,687
So that's really

371
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:47,455
Disturbing

372
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,271
We're definitely making it easier and easier

373
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
4 First states to spy on us

374
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:58,207
By just making more and more information available and filling our our homes and our lives with device

375
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
I heard a story about Vladimir Putin

376
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Once before wear

377
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Apparently

378
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
He doesn't use a cell phone

379
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
He doesn't touch a can

380
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Computer

381
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,167
And he only issues

382
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Top secret

383
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
Commands

384
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,751
6 floors below

385
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
I don't know if that's true or not

386
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:20,223
But Mafia like a mafia Capo just seemed like maybe the only way

387
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
To Italy

388
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,599
Mostly evade your information or having a hot Mike situation

389
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
From happening

390
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
That's certainly one way

391
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:33,535
And again is very different Target

392
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
Then say you were me

393
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,959
Number of people who would like to know what Putin is doing at any given time

394
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
Is much greater than the number of people are interested in my life for yours and the amount of trouble that they're willing to go through

395
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Is much greater

396
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,711
So it's really all about

397
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
Yeah I wonder what he is doing right now

398
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
Posing shirtless for Ocala

399
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
What about

400
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
The way that

401
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
Let's a journalist

402
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,279
Activists

403
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,071
Regular citizens have been

404
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Expanded

405
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
Target foremost

406
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
States cuz you know

407
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Look at someone like

408
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Khashoggi

409
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
There's reason to believe that he was being spied on his well

410
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,567
Not everything track

411
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,943
I mean you look at the journalist that were killed in the CR early this year possibly being tracked

412
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,711
As well

413
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,503
How's that space

414
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
Evolved

415
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
In the last year

416
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,111
Will it used to be that if a state wanted to

417
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,695
Physically track somebody's location they had to send someone to go follow them

418
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,559
But as I said before now we all conveniently carry tracking devices in our pockets

419
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:45,215
I am so if you can own somebody's phone you can get their location and if you can get their location you can learn

420
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,239
An awful lot about

421
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,287
Someone who they're communicating with

422
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Again

423
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
This is

424
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
Why The Safety Dance

425
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,711
Security of these devices is so incredibly important

426
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Because they provide

427
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:01,343
This incredible wealth of information that is so useful to States

428
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
And having said that

429
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,439
Kind of information that is useful to

430
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,023
The states is also the kind of information that is

431
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
That is used

432
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
Domestic

433
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,911
For example abusive partners

434
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,495
That's a very similar relationship to their target

435
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,079
Say an authoritarian government does

436
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,359
To a dissident

437
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:28,223
Are they want to keep track of them they want to know what they're doing the wonder where they're going they want to know who they're talking to

438
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
I had

439
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
As it burns out

440
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,903
You can deploy more or less the same technology in order to do this

441
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,951
I think in the midst of

442
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Venus week

443
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
Facebook

444
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,815
Do Jess if they were giving up

445
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,631
Add information to some of the other bigger

446
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
Search Mediacom

447
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,191
Doctor user

448
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,239
Now you know

449
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,007
And I don't have to

450
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Bring up the Snowden leaks

451
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,615
Is it really can t protect yourself

452
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
From this sort of bronchitis

453
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,687
Does Big Brother

454
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,271
He's in the end there always seems to be some sort of Ace in the Hole

455
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
The bad guys

456
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,575
Well

457
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:10,975
What are the things that I did at BFF a few years ago was I led the

458
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,023
Right of BFFs privacy

459
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
Security advice

460
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,911
Two Ordinary People and vulnerable people in general population

461
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Surveillance

462
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
Defense

463
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
And

464
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,823
One of the ways in which I tried to get people to

465
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,871
To think about surveillance self-defense

466
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,151
Is threat modeling

467
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,759
To really sit down and think about what you wanted protection who you want to protect it from

468
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
And the reason why this is incredibly important

469
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,927
Is that trying to protect everything all the time from everybody will just drive you

470
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,767
I it is impossible and you should not bother

471
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,559
But that doesn't mean that you should give up

472
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,631
It means that you should really just narrow it down

473
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,679
To what am I trying to protect

474
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
By trying to protect

475
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
Against

476
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
I am and

477
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,079
You make all of your medications accordingly

478
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,431
For example if I am particularly concerned

479
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,455
About

480
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,735
A stalker

481
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,271
Or a government

482
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:09,599
I'm going to do very different things than if I'm

483
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,391
Concerned about ads

484
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,671
And adware

485
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:17,023
I'm concerned about my parents spying on me you or

486
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,815
My school

487
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,839
Or my church

488
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,935
These are all different things either different people with different levels of capability

489
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,519
And the things that I need to do in order to avoid them are different

490
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:31,359
I remember a source once told me in

491
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,383
The intelligence

492
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,687
Community when it comes to apts

493
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
Is there targeting you

494
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
The only thing you can do is slow them down

495
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
Cuz they're going to get it

496
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
One way or the other

497
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,599
It depends

498
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,463
Again it depends on the EPT it depends on how determined they are to get you

499
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
And how important

500
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,047
Often

501
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
Find time is it

502
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,727
Especially if you are if you are a journalist

503
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Or if you are an act

504
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,383
Activists and you just need enough time to publish your story or to get your action out

505
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,271
Then being able to delay the people who are were spying on you or trying to understand what you are doing

506
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Is

507
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
Sufficient

508
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
You don't always have to

509
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,135
To keep your opponent in the dark

510
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,416
You just have to keep them several steps

511
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Behind you

512
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
So he's one of my my last

513
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
Cuz I wanted it cuz we haven't really spoken about it

514
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
The elephant in the room

515
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
China

516
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
In the news lately

517
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,680
Apts

518
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
What is China's Main

519
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
Sort of geopolitical

520
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,824
Goal when it comes to using you

521
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,872
Well

522
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,712
What are the interesting things about China is that they have a variety of a peach

523
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
I am in much the same way that Russia's apt landscape is a many

524
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Splendored thing

525
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
So many bears

526
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,720
ISO interview

527
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
Bears

528
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
There are many pens

529
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,632
So in China we have a bunch of

530
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Different

531
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:02,496
Government organizations that engage in in-state hacking

532
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
There are also sort of

533
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
Para government

534
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,664
Organizations organizations that seem to

535
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
The theme to act

536
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
With the blessing of the government

537
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,112
And there are also criminal organizations and there's kind of sub

538
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Overlap between

539
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,976
Similar to Russia

540
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,000
So you see

541
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:29,120
State Espionage being used to uncover

542
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
Sources

543
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Stories

544
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,496
Especially stories surrounding political issues

545
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,312
UC State spying being used

546
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
Aya for State Control

547
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:45,248
For example control of the weaker population in Northwestern

548
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Northwestern China

549
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Angie

550
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,952
And you also see criminal activity and sort of corporate

551
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,256
Which is sometimes

552
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Personal

553
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,584
And other times is.

554
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,400
Kind of in conjunction with

555
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
What state goals

556
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:10,592
A frog sample stealing intellectual property so that a Chinese company can manufacturer

557
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,432
American company or european companies products

558
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,992
More cheaply and therefore

559
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,344
This is more of a personal question for you and the SS but

560
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,392
Do you ever think in a PT

561
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,416
Targeted you

562
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,208
BFF

563
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
More than once

564
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
How did you react that

565
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
I wrote it up

566
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
I really don't feel published

567
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,912
I like that

568
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
Muscle knots not backing down

569
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
I'm going to

570
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
Extremely lazy

571
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
Security researcher

572
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,592
Nothing would make me happier

573
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
Then is governments good

574
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,944
Send me there malware directly

575
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,248
It saves me the trouble of having to find it

576
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,064
12 a.m. PT is out there targeting Ava

577
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,648
Let's get started at GSF. Org

578
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
Spell it right

579
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,744
Les Paul can talk a little bit about dark caracal

580
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
So

581
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,096
Earlier this year

582
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
ESS

583
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
Worked with

584
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:12,544
Security researchers at Lookout ad we uncovered a campaign of cyber espionage

585
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:16,384
That covered both the mobile and desktop device

586
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
That seemed

587
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
To be

588
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,224
Based out of Lebanon

589
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
And was targeting

590
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,856
People would be of interest to the Lebanese government

591
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
We managed

592
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,184
The Crackdown the physical location

593
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
From which

594
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,792
The administrator was logging into the portal

595
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,144
And it was a specific floor of a specific building

596
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,728
Run by the general directorate of

597
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,056
Lebanon in Beirut

598
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,128
So we can't say exactly who was

599
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,480
Who is behind this campaign but we can tell you it's coming from inside the room

600
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,112
And what is the interesting things that we discovered was that this was the

601
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
Same

602
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,440
Infrastructure that had been used

603
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
For us

604
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:07,840
A spying campaign that EFS had reported on a couple of years ago

605
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,144
Which we called operation men

606
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,448
Monroe B&B

607
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Cat

608
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
Wildcat wishes

609
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
Native to the steps

610
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Kazakhstan

611
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,920
And this particular campaign was targeting people of Interest

612
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,200
To Alex.

613
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,272
So we spent some time looking at y

614
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,856
These two campaigns might be using similar infrastructure

615
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,416
For example why is Kazakhstan spying on Lebanon

616
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
Why is Lebanon spying on Kazakhstan

617
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:39,584
We think it is more likely that this is a shared infrastructure which is being rented out

618
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,376
Put the states and Criminal

619
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:44,192
And we've kept track of this for the last

620
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
A couple of years

621
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
And we think that this is probably the

622
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:53,408
The new frontier in cheaper and more

623
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
Turn key Solutions

624
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
To government spying

625
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,296
Or lower end States

626
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
What you're saying is

627
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,368
I mean for 1

628
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,696
This is an example of assertive emerging country using these tips

629
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,720
Tools for their own

630
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:11,328
Chipa claims but also lebanon and kazakhstan where outsourcing it

631
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
The privateer

632
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Yes

633
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
That is what we think

634
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
Any idea who that would be

635
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:20,288
No I can't tell you who's running that infrastructure that is a story for another report

636
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,360
But what I can tell you is

637
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,896
That we think this is

638
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,712
Kind of the New Frontier of

639
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
Cheaper and cheaper spying

640
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,648
And it solves the problem that you can see in the hacking team emails from a couple of years ago

641
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,232
One of the problems that the lower end state

642
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
Was

643
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:44,352
That they had difficulty using hacking team products

644
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:48,192
They didn't have enough of the staff that spoke English

645
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,496
Or that had the

646
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,824
The training to understand how to use the

647
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
The tools

648
00:26:55,104 --> 00:27:00,480
This made it more difficult for them to do their spine so you can look through the Theo kind of

649
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,832
Trouble tickets that were being that were being sent out

650
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,136
And you can see I think it was

651
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
It wasn't cut

652
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
It was like

653
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,744
Azerbaijan to Turkmenistan

654
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
Bistan

655
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:17,376
Where they just didn't have anybody who could communicate with with hacking

656
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
Team in order to fix the problem with her and play

657
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,032
And what are the ways around this is just to create a portal

658
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,080
So you have a

659
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
You have a

660
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
Third party

661
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
Service

662
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,528
The that makes affordable that you can then log into that makes

663
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:39,904
Spying even easier and requires even less training and even less of

664
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,744
A language barrier so we think that that is why what is happening with sort of the

665
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
The lowest

666
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,560
End of

667
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
Estate buying

668
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,912
Yeah but you do is South Sudan if I remember correctly

669
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,984
That says you didn't bought those tools from hacking team and then

670
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
They couldn't even

671
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
Use it and I didn't even the hacking team

672
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,104
Employees were making fun of them

673
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
That sounds about right

674
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
I think that's what it was

675
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
Seems legit

676
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:04,992
Having said all this

677
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,064
Going forward what worries you

678
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
Cities in the future

679
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,672
Nothing that really worries me about apts in the future just

680
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,464
Just from this week

681
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,864
Is amnesty International's report about a campaign of fishing

682
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
That they've seen

683
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,960
Targets in North Africa and the Middle East

684
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,008
And one of the most interesting aspects

685
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,800
Of this phishing campaign

686
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,592
Was that they found a way to search

687
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
Convent

688
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,408
Two-factor Authentication

689
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,456
At least

690
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,528
For application the application method

691
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
Send SMS

692
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,368
2fa this would not work with

693
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,928
But like are you the key or

694
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,208
Up like any other

695
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
Similar key

696
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,840
And I find that extremely disturbing because most

697
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,888
Most 2fa solutions

698
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:56,704
Are are vulnerable to this attack

699
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
And while we

700
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,520
Racine similar attacks

701
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
From five eyes

702
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,360
From the extremely

703
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
What we consider to be high on doctors

704
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,712
I it is very disturbing to see

705
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,248
The same sort of attack

706
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,296
Filter down to lower at doctors

707
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,576
Because

708
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:18,976
It's it's only going to get cheaper and easier and more automated and this means that I need to see

709
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
Start recommending you the keys

710
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:25,120
Two more and more people and I need to start pushing more platforms

711
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,424
To support

712
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,752
Better forms of two-factor Authentication

713
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,544
It used to be there just getting

714
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,640
Platforms to support any kind of 2fa was considered to be a major

715
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
You need to support keys

716
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,296
If you don't if you don't support keys are you

717
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,600
You're not really keeping vulnerable populations safe

718
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,184
So basically you're saying is meme the attacks are getting

719
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,328
Wiley more sophisticated and easier and cheaper to do and more and more countries are engaging in this kind of

720
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,656
Kind of tool

721
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:11,456
Problem this week's episode was produced by Lorenzo franceschi DKI and recorded by Mitch Ragan

722
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:15,552
He was at inviting white thanks for listen to cyber we back next week

723
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:21,952
In the meantime please tell your friends about us and giving us a review on Apple podcast
