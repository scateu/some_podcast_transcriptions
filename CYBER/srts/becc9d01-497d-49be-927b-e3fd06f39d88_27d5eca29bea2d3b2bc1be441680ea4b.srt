00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Eagle one package being delivered

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
Macros hipster take on white supremacist him in the unity of them buying online

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
Publication known as unicorn Riot what they did was dumbest series of 770,000 messages

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104
From the identity evropa Discord slack and other chat channels exposing the group's attempts

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,504
Is the deadly unite the right rally in Charlottesville

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
The plan was to go mainstream Indie player in American politics

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,304
Identity evropa try to Rebrand as simply pro-white decrying their Neo-Nazi labels I think that would be a major

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,704
Yes if we can finally start having a dialogue and not so one of these oh we need to talk about race but let's go

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,104
Just bring on a person of European Heritage she's going to sit there as a stool pigeon as a yes man

10
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,504
Reveals that was total BS the Unicorn ride dump is an example of how people are

11
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,904
Trying to fight back online against a growing radical popular Neo-Nazi extremist

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304
Right. Things like the ideologies that spawned the Christ Church Terror attacks from ever happening today

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,704
Hey we have Freddie Martinez I got none within how can circles who's a member of the Unicorn ride team that took down identity

14
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,104
Europa to tell us what it's like tracking Nazis online well thanks

15
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,152
For coming on the show today

16
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,200
So tell me what is

17
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
Unicorn

18
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
Riot

19
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,600
That's a good question. Is a decentralized

20
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
Alternative media Collective

21
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
So we cover everything

22
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Fromm

23
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:13,376
Like social justice issues to environmental issues racism

24
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
Avalon doing journalism

25
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,520
Other people aren't doing but we checked

26
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,312
Big restaurant rustic stands

27
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,944
We work very hard to uphold like Barry Sanders on ourselves

28
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,736
So

29
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,552
Yeah that's how we approach

30
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:36,160
Decentralized

31
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
Group

32
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
What was the ethos

33
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,536
Exactly I think we try to tell stories at like

34
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,936
Most people aren't covering our efforts around the taxes Pipeline and telling a story about the

35
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:52,544
Struggles against him in the time where other people weren't doing that

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,616
The Intercept of a huge series about

37
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,432
Private and Military contractors

38
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,272
Working to effectively you know call.

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
A threat to National Security

40
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:12,256
And so when we were when you can write with doing that reporting or ethos is like we're going to tell the story about

41
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
About like not only like

42
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
Glad struggles indigenous struggles

43
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
Environmentalism

44
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,448
And like you know several social

45
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
How to write

46
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:27,360
But we did it at a time when no one else is doing it so I think are already those who just to go after

47
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
Stories that no one else knowing

48
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
Cover

49
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:34,528
You know and we didn't really really successful at doing that

50
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
And you also seem to be a collective of a lot of different types

51
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
The people

52
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,696
Yeah you know you have Developers YouTube journalist

53
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
People like yourself

54
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
Everyone sort of involved in this I mean

55
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,608
For lack of a better reference

56
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
Seems almost like a professionalized anonymous

57
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,520
Sing way we all consider ourselves journalist in different capacities

58
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
Neurologist

59
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
Web developer video editor

60
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
We all

61
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
Collectively story

62
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:13,440
Incredible about this recording is that it doesn't take a 50-person research

63
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
You know kind of bootstrap DIY

64
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
Independent journalism

65
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,935
Can have really impactful results

66
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
Stories

67
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:29,311
If you guys come onto my radar as someone who who does all reporting on the far right

68
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
When you do the shoes ironmark Stomp

69
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
Of neo-nazis

70
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,455
And their chat logs about a year ago

71
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,247
And you know you

72
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
Who is the bunch of them

73
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,319
And then you got to do it again

74
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,623
With a group called identity evropa

75
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
So why don't you tell me

76
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
How did you come about

77
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
Dumping what was it

78
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,791
770,000 messages of this group

79
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,911
So I did need Europa is one of the largest Neo-Nazi groups

80
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,471
And the US

81
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,519
They were one of the catalyst

82
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
Organized

83
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
Unite the right

84
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103
Rally

85
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,127
Hallettsville

86
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,687
So we had known them for a long time

87
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,527
We've had sources many sources

88
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,575
About

89
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
They were trying

90
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Get published

91
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,511
I'm so in this case we had about seven

92
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,863
All right chat messages that we published as well as

93
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
Slack Channel

94
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,679
Are there

95
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
Bits of information that were given to us like

96
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
Unlisted YouTube channel

97
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,431
Largest stories

98
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
Our reporting

99
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:41,759
Used

100
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:52,767
I need also this group was trying to sort of Groom itself as a much more palatable version

101
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:59,423
You know we're just provide you know it's not that bad we don't hate other races or anything we're not Nazis

102
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,471
With this chat log

103
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Dumb basically showed that

104
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,055
That was

105
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,407
So the messaging is really important to them

106
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
They are

107
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,247
Are closely aligned with other

108
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
Star recruits

109
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Your call

110
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,879
Generation identity

111
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
I'm GI

112
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
Because Europe has berries

113
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
Speech loss after vacation

114
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,399
They're very very careful about their images

115
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,335
And so they're very careful about

116
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,639
They say things like

117
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,479
I mean they are careful on the River about

118
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Don't you know

119
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
I'm call for violence

120
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:54,207
But they're exactly

121
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,999
I just want to hear about it

122
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,583
So a lot of it is just kind of like Romaine disorder

123
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,167
Hipster Nazi like as long as you wear khakis

124
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
A dress shirt

125
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
So a lot of what they focus

126
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Cassandra Lee

127
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
Presenting themselves

128
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,551
Which is just like another

129
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
Dog whistle

130
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
White power

131
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Building is this

132
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
The chat

133
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:30,559
Dump also expose that there were what like seven members of the military that were involved with this group as well as

134
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
Some people in law enforcement

135
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,631
What's surprising is not

136
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,959
Are people in the military or law enforcement

137
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
Or anything like that

138
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
Surprising

139
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,127
Is just like the public reaction

140
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
The public will sometimes

141
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,735
Email us like hey

142
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,039
I think my girlfriend is dating a Nazi

143
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
So

144
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
We were surprised that there were

145
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,439
You know law enforcement and military officials

146
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,767
EMTs

147
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,047
School teacher who

148
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,071
Expose today

149
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,911
I'll be part of this group there was a GOP

150
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,215
Officer

151
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
Who works for the governor

152
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
Who sings like

153
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Those names

154
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,711
In particular are maybe a little bit surprising but it's just the organizational level

155
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,039
Professional some of these individuals

156
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,391
Everyday Society

157
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:32,255
I mean they really try to make it seem like they weren't

158
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Major

159
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,839
Engage with major neo-Nazi

160
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,423
Literature and like that but then they had this big pamphleteering

161
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,751
Game of the replying with her dropping tons of identity evropa

162
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
Pamphlets around

163
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
Aries all over the US

164
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
And they called it project seeds

165
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
We will see gif

166
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,479
Code for James Mason neo-Nazi

167
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
Insurgency Bible

168
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:03,487
Author similar to the Turner Diaries witch inspired Timothy McVeigh to blow up

169
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,767
The alarm City

170
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
Federal Building

171
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
That's revered by loss of Neo-Nazi group

172
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
Like I'd like information

173
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:18,079
But the entire idea with Siege is that you

174
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
Create random acts of violence

175
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
Inside out

176
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,271
So when they call flyering projects that have a private literature server

177
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
Where there

178
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,063
You know

179
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,903
Read Tara Taylor read books about

180
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
The protocols of the Elders of Zion

181
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,119
Conspiracy theory book about how juice wrld

182
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,911
Your videos talking about

183
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:48,543
Well I don't recommend

184
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,383
All of these sort of intersections

185
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:59,295
Also like these books

186
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,879
Nazi propaganda

187
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Layer with like

188
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,743
Only if you want to read that on your free time go ahead I just don't

189
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
That's really how I

190
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:11,583
I mean

191
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Two dozen

192
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:18,239
Freddy you're obviously well known in the hacking Community as well as how we first met

193
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,543
When I was hosting the show cyber War

194
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,871
How did you how to unicorn

195
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Individual sources

196
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
I came to the

197
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,879
The project because I

198
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,927
Ran into a colleague who was

199
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,231
Helping unicorn riot

200
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
And

201
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
They were you no writings

202
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
Very basic

203
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
The journalists do their research

204
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
Eventually we

205
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,079
Turn data into what's now the Discord takes platform

206
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
I'm so we have a group

207
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:57,919
You know

208
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,967
Anonymous Developers

209
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,575
Volunteer their time to make these chat logs readable and searchable

210
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
I'm so over like the last

211
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Year

212
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
People have dedicated

213
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
You know

214
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
Hours and hours and hours and third time

215
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,327
To make it so.

216
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,143
Like we have released

217
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,727
1.7 million

218
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,639
And so one of the ways I got involved

219
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,431
With this work was

220
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
You're making

221
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,991
Easier to do

222
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,783
And then

223
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
Once you read

224
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,367
500 million chat messages

225
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,463
Then you can actually understand

226
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,255
That's how I do it

227
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
Yeah I was going to say that

228
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,887
The whole database is actually more searchable zevran a lot of

229
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,935
A lot of Stories on the WikiLeaks

230
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Database intern

231
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,775
The Stratford

232
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,359
And unicorn riot what is a lot easier to

233
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
A lot easier

234
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,503
Yeah it's cuz we use a lot too so I can every time you need

235
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,783
I hate you

236
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,623
You know it's like one of those

237
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Often

238
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,719
And you know we're using the same software tools that we watched

239
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Obviously

240
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
1

241
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,143
So what's next do you have

242
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,703
Any other leaks coming

243
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Look

244
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Purpose

245
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,847
All right recruitment is always to get more members

246
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,895
New our faces

247
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
Dakotamart

248
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
You know wiring events

249
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,783
The impact of our reporting has been that

250
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
People are leaving this movement

251
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
You know in to some degree like

252
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,183
It's not a thing that you want to be associated with

253
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:46,975
So that's one

254
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,047
Like aspect of like what I think it's important

255
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,727
The other thing is that we do have

256
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Upcoming stories

257
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
We're trying to figure out like

258
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,871
What are the things that's going to happen

259
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,735
Maybe next few months is figure out like how do we tell stories

260
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Yahoo news

261
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,279
In Uno

262
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,327
Awesome person who is o

263
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Officer in a school

264
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,935
Those are not like different stories are kind of the same

265
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,495
And they're linking lots of different ways

266
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:35,103
And so we're trying to figure out you know I think the next thing we're going to do is I tell stories about life

267
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
What are these relationships actually look like

268
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,711
There's a third story

269
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,015
That is really like how to use

270
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,575
All link together show the

271
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,903
Person who shot up the mosque in New Zealand

272
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,487
She was sending money to Martin snow

273
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,815
HGI in

274
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:55,839
Austria

275
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:02,495
Who's very costly pipe

276
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
I think the New York Times Are story about it today

277
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
About how this mess

278
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
Shootings are all

279
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,527
So what inspired the other is what we know

280
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,831
And the internet has a lot to do with with

281
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,391
And I saved the internet but

282
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Online chatter and

283
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
Different platforms really help that

284
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
I mean the

285
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:31,679
US law enforcement uses

286
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Right

287
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
So yeah so trying to figure out

288
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Work

289
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,431
But there are more stories coming

290
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
So I can

291
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,551
No one's out there listening to the strattons worried about like

292
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,135
Are you reporting

293
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,927
These are these groups or not

294
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
Obviously not healthy

295
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,047
Annuities are actions

296
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,863
And Michael Jackson

297
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:01,631
Isa

298
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,703
That's like that's just like my personal

299
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,263
So basically

300
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,823
Any neo-nazis were listening right now

301
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,639
You might end up on a unicorn ride dump

302
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
I mean look this is a personal

303
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,087
Certainly do believe that people can change

304
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
I just don't think there's anything you need

305
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
And

306
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
What's happening

307
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
I just like

308
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,495
Everything is like there's nothing there so I don't know why

309
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,775
Stick around

310
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Skroutz

311
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
Well I mean keep up the great work it's

312
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:49,759
Seems like it's going in the right direction and I'm sure this will not be the last time I hear about unicorn riot

313
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Exposing

314
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,135
A white nationalist proof online by nuking them and showing all

315
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Chat logs in that

316
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,999
Love to be out of this line in recording

317
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
But

318
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:05,631
You're not a suspect that it won't be the last time we talked

319
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Definitely

320
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,263
Don't believe wallpaper

321
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
Thanks buddy

322
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:21,247
And now it's more recent big news in online white nationalism came via a giant scoop

323
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271

You broke

335
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,287
That Facebook would be

336
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
The outline

337
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,103
All white natural

Internal con

349
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,935
In moderation documents

350
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Ideas of the PowerPoint slides that

351
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Is giving Twitter

352
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
The moderators

353
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Basted eggs

354
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Here's what you should do

355
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Levi's.

356
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
To take down

357
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
I'm an

358
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,967
On this document

359
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
There is one

360
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,039
Pacific slide that was like

361
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,599
Raise up where was one presentation that was like

362
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,671
After the Charlottesville unite the right rally

363
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,975
Here's how Facebook handles why nausea

364
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
Amazon wipes

365
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
CNY

366
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
And at the time Facebook said

367
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,191
White supremacy and racism is ban on AR platform

368
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
But white nationalism

369
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
And wife separate

370
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
Are allowed

371
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,335
Explicitly allowed

372
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
Do not remove it

373
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,943
And they Define white nationalism using literally the wicked

374
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,247
PDA definition of white nationalism

375
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,087
Which I don't have in front of me right now but that they pulled it directly from there

376
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
And they're like

377
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
Their argument was that

378
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
White nationalism and

379
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743
And white separatism are not in

380
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Apparently hateful and that

381
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,095
They are actually could be inclusive

382
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,631
Which is like Egyptian

383
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,191
Sir this is something that keeps coming up with

384
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:20,031
Not just people but tech companies I mean how do you how can you justify

385
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
Oh I think being white is the best

386
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,871
That's not race

387
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
Right and it's it's because Facebook tries to

388
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,735
Treat all people the exact same width

389
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Out

390
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
Taking into a

391
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,111
Counter like the history of racism or the history of power dynamics

392
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,671
It's in the United States and other like Western

393
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,791
So while you have white nationalism which is like very inherently tides

394
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
White supremacy

395
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Andre inherently tide

396
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,679
Racism and segregation and slavery

397
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
You know

398
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,007
Facebook wanted to allow a nationalism

399
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
Because they wanted to allow things like fast

400
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Not really this

401
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,871
Same thing

402
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,687
I mean that support national news apps

403
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
Absolutely not even close

404
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:06,367
Brightwell Facebook singing was like Hey if we banned white nationalism we all set the band black nationalism we also have to be

405
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:11,487
Basque nationalism in all these other nationalist movements that are in a much smaller and also coming

406
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
From groups that don't inherently have a lot of

407
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
Power.

408
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,607
Like unlike White

409
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
Unlike

410
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:18,911
You know the white race

411
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
States

412
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:25,311
So I mean obviously that's nonsense because you can Facebook can ban whatever it wants to ban is

413
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,615
It's just that enforcing it is slightly more difficult

414
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,639
Ethical because

415
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
They have to

416
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
Neil make more rules

417
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,039
And so Facebook has many different rules they're very special

418
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Civic

419
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,599
Like when we did this

420
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,671
Investigation we found out there are dozens and dozens

421
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
Examples like this

422
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Where it's like

423
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:47,583
White nationalism was loud white separatism was is allowed but whites

424
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,863
Supremacy is not

425
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,983
It's like what yeah so like a different example of this and this is completely absurd

426
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:57,055
Is that Facebook doesn't allow like nudity on its way

427
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,151
Website but it does allow breastfeeding mothers on its website

428
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Because

429
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,967
That's like an allows artistic to

430
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
Depictions of nudity

431
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
Because they're been back lashes

432
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
Photos taken down

433
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,903
Make it so specific as to say

434
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
You are not allowed

435
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,487
How to post anuses on Facebook like

436
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,119
Like this is in there. You're not allowed to post an actual butthole like no anuses on Facebook

437
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
Unless it's a political commentary

438
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,239
Which means that you are allowed to put

439
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
You're allowed

440
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,031
How to photoshop

441
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,847
Anuses on to Donald Trump's face

442
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
Where his eyes are

443
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,455
This is an actual example with an actual photo

444
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:42,111
Like that is allowed and don't take that down but then they have another example that has Kim Jong un's face

445
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
And his mouth has been replaced by an anus

446
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,231
And there's a butt plug going into the anus

447
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,279
And that needs to be taken

448
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,143
Because that is sexual content because it has a butt plug

449
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,423
I dislike

450
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,495
This is like written in Facebook documents that are like sent

451
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,383
Two tens of thousands of my God raised around the world and it's like it's an absurd example but it's like

452
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
These are the lines that Facebook

453
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Kids drawing

454
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,759
And this is how they are ultimately moderating

455
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
Speech for over

456
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,831
2 billion people across the world

457
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
See you this story

458
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
You stay on top of it

459
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:21,280
In terms of distance classic appointing estate on top of the story and then we fast forward to now

460
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,608
Yes we publish the story were like hey

461
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,424
Facebook allows white nationalism and obviously rumors

462
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Is very bad

463
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:32,288
You know you had civil rights Scholars you had

464
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,104
Black history experts and you had these

465
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Civil Society groups being like

466
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
These are not different things

467
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Facebook should make

468
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
The distinction and they start putting pressure on

469
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,088
So they are like hey Facebook you need to change this

470
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
This is very bad

471
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,136
And

472
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
I think back in maybe cept

473
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Amber

474
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
We learned that Facebook was real

475
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Considering

476
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
This

477
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,584
Like it was reconsidering its stance

478
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,888
A story that was like a Facebook

479
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,704
Is reconsidering this but we didn't know where they're ultimately

480
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
So last week

481
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,592
We learned that Facebook finally did make a change

482
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
I and it is

483
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,712
Now treating white nationalism and white separatism the same as whites

484
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Mercy witch

485
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,016
Brings that much more in life

486
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:22,208
You know one thing about this story that's interesting is like Facebook has not had a good year

487
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:26,560
Very clearly and this was one of those things that it did

488
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
Even I and I am definitely a Facebook hater

489
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,936
Thought to myself

490
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
But

491
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,264
Is the right thing to do

492
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,360
Yeah I mean this is the right thing to do I think

493
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,408
The people that we talked to her like

494
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,968
Why did it take so long but also like

495
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
Thank God they finally did it

496
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
And I will

497
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,600
Just sort of couch that in saying that

498
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,160
This all depends on how Facebook actually

499
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,952
End up enforcing these policies

500
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,304
Is because we do know like we do know that things like unite the right were organized

501
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,864
Did you know that they're openly White

502
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,656
On Facebook

503
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,728
For organizing or in groups were talking to each other

504
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,288
And we know that they use a lot of code words we know that they

505
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,104
That you know have learned to evade Facebook

506
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
Looks content moderators

507
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
And a good example of this is

508
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,712
Facebook says that

509
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
It's only going to bandage

510
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
Explicit white nationalism

511
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
And white stuff

512
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
And that

513
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,880
Basically finding implicit or

514
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,416
Coded versions of it

515
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
And removing it is

516
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
Is too difficult

517
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Duet scale

518
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,048
Like they're just unable their moderators are not

519
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:30,816
Trained enough

520
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,584
How to be able to

521
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,864
Figure that out

522
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
So they're just going to leave it up

523
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
For the time being

524
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:39,776
And Huffington Post actually had a pretty good article

525
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
I had a great story about

526
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,432
Yeah so I don't know a whole lot about faith Goldy

527
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,248
Probably you know more I douche

528
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
She's a racist

529
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
White nationalist

530
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
Kind of troll

531
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,136
From Canada

532
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:57,952
She recently attacked one of our reporters

533
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,512
Online with a with a photo

534
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,584
Insult a great reporter

535
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:06,400
She's definitely someone who

536
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,984
I think for a while she had on her Twitter profile like white Nashua

537
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,544
Yeah she is in an avowed White

538
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,824
Looks like that's the label that

539
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,616
Uses I believe so

540
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,176
You know here is a great example of something that Facebook

541
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,480
Probably should remove under its policy

542
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,296
And she posted a video where she said like

543
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,368
I am a black nationalist which I think was poking

544
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,904
Poking at Facebook

545
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,952
You know policy saying that they're going to

546
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,000
Continue to allow black nationalism

547
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:37,888
And also said yeah white populations in white majority European Western countries are being

548
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,448
Quote replaced by non-white people which

549
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
It's obviously referring to

550
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,568
This conspiracy theories flashlight

551
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:51,456
If it's bad enough to call but like this idea Boise

552
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
It's very much so

553
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
It's

554
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,600
It's reference even though she doesn't realize that she's referencing

555
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,392
Micom she's referencing

556
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,672
Hitler speech

557
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
When she sings

558
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:07,072
You'll see that what you're saying right now

559
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
As historical press

560
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,496
Write an endless coming from like an invalid white nationalist on Facebook said that this doesn't violate the policy in the

561
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
Leaving app

562
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:20,384
And they told the Huffington Post that we followed up with them they told us the same thing so

563
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,784
I mean on some level it's very good and it you know for me personally like I'm proud that we were able to

564
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
You know report this

565
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,856
Historian cause Facebook to make a policy

566
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Sea change

567
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,416
But ultimately it's only going to

568
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,184
Be as good as

569
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
Enforce

570
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,280
If they're drying such a

571
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,584
Narrow view of white

572
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,888
White nationalism actually is

573
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,912
Then it's not going to be that

574
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,984
The question is

575
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:49,824
If you have Facebook doing it find them we'll see what the enforcement is

576
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
Anatomically

577
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
We don't know

578
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
For a while exactly what it does

579
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
But

580
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
I mean

581
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,552
You wear DC right now

582
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
Twitter

583
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
YouTube these other

584
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
Shoe Fashions of

585
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
Neo-Nazi militants

586
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,488
Not taking the harshest stance against

587
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,840
Yeah I mean yeah you've had some gray reporting on this

588
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
As well which

589
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,632
Yeah you

590
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
You reported that a lot of

591
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
These

592
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,264
Web hosting podcast hosts have been taking down

593
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:23,360
You know that domain names are the servers of a valid neonoe

594
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,688
And meanwhile those same people are just

595
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,968
Regrouping on YouTube

596
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Toobin Twitter

597
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,808
The biggest offender to me

598
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
Internship not doing anything

599
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,648
Are there like

600
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,672
Frankly doing

601
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
Nothing and then

602
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,000
But I think the crazy thing is is

603
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
What it was Isis

604
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,840
We saw Atkins

605
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
Completely different attitude

606
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
Which kind of puzzles

607
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
Yeah I mean

608
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,800
Yes there was a completely different attitude toward it

609
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
And

610
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,432
I everything everything I say here is just kind of like speculation but

611
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,736
You know obviously YouTube

612
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,760
And

613
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,808
Twitter and Facebook are all American

614
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Companies

615
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,344
That

616
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Ino

617
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,696
Predominantly operate in English like in their corporate

618
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,488
Setting in their corporate world

619
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,376
They can take down ISIS content and if they over-reach on that like they're not going to get the

620
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,656
The blowback that they're going

621
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
To get if they overeat

622
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:20,960
Answer

623
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
Taking down like white Nashville

624
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
Are whites ever

625
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,288
Isamar whites

626
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,336
Like you seen

627
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
Here in the US

628
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:32,224
Facebook accidentally took down a Chick-fil-A appreciation page

629
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,248
In 20

630
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,552
14 I believe and called it a hate

631
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Croup

632
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,112
And Facebook admitted that that was

633
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
A mistake

634
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,184
And mistakes do happen because there's snow

635
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,488
Millions upon millions of posts on Facebook

636
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
And Ted Cruz

637
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,048
To this day

638
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
Is like

639
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,632
Heading on Facebook saying that they're biased against

640
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,936
Conservatives because of this decision made

641
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,240
Presumably by one single person

642
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
In 2014

643
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
Like as a mistake

644
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,360
Whereas you're not going to get the same sort of pushback if

645
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,664
You know you are taking down

646
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,248
Things that are quite Isis but they are

647
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
In that realm another serve like

648
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
Muslim extremist

649
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,160
Type content that maybe doesn't rise to the level

650
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,744
Where if it was white nationalism a wimpy taken down

651
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Buy YouTuber by Facebook

652
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:25,472
But you get what I'm saying oh no I think they are

653
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
Comparison I would dry I think

654
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
I think

655
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,872
The same reason Donald Trump doesn't come out

656
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,408
And condemned white Nash

657
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Terrorism

658
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
And actually even

659
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,736
Admitted

660
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:37,504
The thing

661
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
The same reason

662
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
That you're not

663
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Twitter Anthony

664
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,880
Coming down hard on these

665
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
I think it's the same thing as

666
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
Because

667
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
Ultimately

668
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
In some form or another

669
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
They need their

670
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,096
Right right I mean yeah I think that

671
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,680
When we reported that Facebook was taking this down

672
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,240
You had Fringe figures but not

673
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Really like

674
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:02,592
Hardcore Nazis like sort of light

675
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
Bright figures who are not

676
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:11,040
All the way right but are kind of like a Candace Owens of the world like Facebook is coming for us now

677
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Acts like this is

678
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
The slippery slope this is

679
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
A bad thing they're going to come after

680
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Conservatives

681
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
And the blowback has been

682
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,744
Not quite as as strong as I

683
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
I thought it might be

684
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,376
But you can imagine you know YouTube taking down something like

685
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,704
You know some of these larger influencers likes

686
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,984
Steven Mall in LA

687
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
I even like Jordan

688
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
On some level

689
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,336
Like if they start

690
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:37,664
Taking down that sort of content the blowback from their users going

691
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
Ridiculous

692
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:41,760
And I think that they are being extremely

693
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,552
Cautious to the point that it

694
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
It's hurting them

695
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,088
Like

696
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,136
In your reporting we found that

697
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
They are not taking down

698
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,000
Actively neo-Nazi

699
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
Content

700
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
Absurd

701
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:01,472
Yeah they said hey we're demonetizing this or putting this behind like a cons

702
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
Content warning quick

703
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:05,312
Through thing we're moving lights for removing comments

704
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
But

705
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
You can still find it on search and it's still there

706
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,712
And they know they exist and they decide to leave it up

707
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
Exactly

708
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:20,416
Like I don't any that exactly exact same people that you know web host have already taken

709
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:23,488
Down these are the same people like these are outright

710
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,048
Recitations of audiobooks like

711
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,096
The Siege audiobook witches

712
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,632
The the

713
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:32,960
Definition of Manifesto

714
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,240
Atomwaffen division

715
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,312
Right and so I mean this is violent content this is

716
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,128
Actively hateful content this isn't like

717
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
Debating

718
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,712
Race Theory it's

719
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,552
Like debating it's like actively hateful and actively built

720
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
Yeah and yet it

721
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Still online

722
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,904
Yeah I mean

723
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:57,792
I think that the platforms have a lot to answer for in the aftermath of Christchurch I and

724
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
Pittsburgh and all these other

725
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,120
No Terror attacks that were

726
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
2 White

727
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
I think that

728
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
It's you can't say that

729
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,776
The internet definitely cause

730
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
What is the tax

731
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
Definitely radicalized

732
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:10,848
People I think there's

733
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,616
Just a lot of

734
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,992
Aspects to that but it's clearly one important part of the radicals

735
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
In process

736
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
Clearly an important part of

737
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
The

738
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,648
Propaganda machine and the information machine

739
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,440
And the fact that they

740
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
Have done

741
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,744
Such a bad job of taking it

742
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,048
Down and that they haven't acted as

743
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
Quickly and as

744
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,096
Forcefully as they've acted

745
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,144
With things like Isis

746
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
It just demonstrate

747
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Grace that there's

748
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,240
I agree completely and I think

749
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,800
I think this is more of a reflection of where we are

750
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
Socially and politically

751
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
Then just

752
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
It's an internet

753
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,480
I think the internet's where we go to reflect on

754
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
Who we are and what we do and how we grow

755
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Group together

756
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:54,624
And I think that the world has a much bigger problem with it

757
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
Extremism

758
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Then we'd like to

759
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,464
And I think the internet always has a

760
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:03,840
Yeah I'm very interested to see where this goes because there was an interview and then you are

761
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
X with

762
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,144
I YouTube

763
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
Head of product I believe forehead a policy

764
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,264
And you know his answers were

765
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,032
Or bad

766
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
Like a terrible

767
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,872
It's very

768
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:20,736
Right they don't seem to have a handle on the problem they don't seem to have a handle on how bad this is I mean you have

769
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
Play PewDiePie the most

770
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
Popular YouTuber

771
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
I believe still

772
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,904
Very close to most popular YouTuber

773
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,952
Is making videos that

774
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,024
Are gateways off into these ideologies

775
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
It's like if you stay on there and you click

776
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,656
Through the recommendations like the algorithm will eventually push you in the

777
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
Radical

778
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
Radicalizing path

779
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,008
And Facebook hasn't reckoned with

780
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,568
Is recommendation an inch and it hasn't

781
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
Reckoned with

782
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,384
How it does search

783
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,200
And ultimately hasn't reckoned with how it deals with

784
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,760
These popular but Fringe figures that

785
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Platform

786
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
No

787
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
It hasn't

788
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,696
Honestly this is me just being baffled

789
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
That they haven't tried

790
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
Cuz I think to me

791
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,536
Like anybody else who

792
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,560
Saw what happened

793
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Christ Church

794
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
And just

795
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,936
Daniela the referencing that was going on from the terrorist

796
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,496
And what he said it was so obviously

797
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
But he was

798
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
You know

799
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:21,920
He's at least in the mix online mix online in a way that is much more than just a passive

800
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,712
Epatha viewer

801
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
And to think that there were

802
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,552
Figures involved with that

803
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
That wouldn't be banned or you wouldn't

804
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,904
Look at something so horrific

805
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
We watch the video

806
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,536
Yeah yeah he said it's like how could you not watch that and what can I do to stop

807
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
Someone from

808
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
Thinking these things

809
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,168
Yeah I think if you want to learn more about what

810
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,568
Facebook and YouTube and these companies value you want to read the big Bloomberg story that was published

811
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,848
Earlier this week

812
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,152
Our last week I guess at this point

813
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Where

814
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,224
I know you two was chasing

815
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
Engagement

816
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,016
At all

817
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:03,648
At all costs like you know people within you two were like hey there's a lot of bad stuff on our platform like

818
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
Can we get rid of it

819
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,720
And you know the people at the top or like

820
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
Well bad stuff does well

821
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
Yvonne Gage with it people

822
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
Comment on it people

823
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,864
Shareit

824
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,680
And they were chasing engagement so

825
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:19,008
My sweater yeah it's the same thing and I think it's like

826
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,312
Until that changes

827
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,128
These problems are going to continue to exist

828
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:30,016
Agreed on that

829
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:36,416
