1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Eagle one package being delivered four years us officials have been sounding the alarm about

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
Impending catastrophic Cyber attack an enemy strike damaging or destroying real life infrastructure and

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
Causing real harm

4
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:41,728
Without using any traditional weapons just computers some like then defense secretary

5
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,752
Leon Panetta

6
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,080
World War II hyperbole to sell the threat

7
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,872
The collective result

8
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,456
Abby's kinds of attacks

9
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,016
Could be a cyber Pearl Harbor

10
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,064
Others preferred a more recent

11
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,904
Is a cyber 9/11 is a cyber Pearl Harbor

12
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,024
Within the realm of possibility

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,584
Different storage areas of impact

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,424
But amplify the Marvin Ivanov again look we're really facing a

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
Potential

16
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
Cyber 911

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
Cyber Pearl Harbor

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,056
Despite this alarm is rhetoric

19
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,616
There's actually not that many examples that have happened recently

20
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,664
There's of course stuxnet

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,016
And in 2015 Russian hackers took down parts of a power grid in Ukraine

22
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
Causing a blackout for a few hours

23
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:31,136
Then in 2017 a piece of malware known as Triton

24
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,464
Almost caused an explosion in a refinery in Saudi Arabia

25
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,024
So how real is this right now it is

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
Should we really be worried about a cyber 9/11

27
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
What does that even mean then

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,424
What does heaven look like

29
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
Today we're talking to Robert Lee

30
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,312
Former NSA analyst and now CEO of Drago

31
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,128
Infosec startup that tracks hackers

32
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,176
Grafter critical infrastructure

33
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
Industrial controls

34
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:03,136
I'm done Aku and this is cyber

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,472
Thanks for being here there was this disruption

36
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
What happens

37
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
Recently

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
On the West Coast

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
Lot of people worrying about it and thinking about it in terms of

40
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
Infrastructure tax

41
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
What did you make of it

42
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
Yeah and I mean it's an important thing

43
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
And I think this is

44
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:35,392
This is always where we have that that difficult why I'm Nuance right on like one hand going to talk about the importance

45
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
Something and highlight that is

46
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Horton

47
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
But on the other hand

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
When things get highlighted in the portal

49
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,888
Faster than a contact of infrastructure It won't always assume

50
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
Destruction

51
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
Power grid failing excetera is it really hard

52
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
Talk about something important

53
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,336
I'm not in that level of importance

54
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408
But it was an important issue so basically

55
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,944
From what we understand

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
Remote adversary

57
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
Charlie Weis

58
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
What's hacker what are going to call it

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,232
Compromise advice or try to compromise of iso the head of vulnerability on it supposed to be a Cisco networking gear

60
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
And then try to do so

61
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:17,376
I'm cause of denial of service on a device with it was intentional or not

62
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
And then Allosaurus the device

63
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
What is routing

64
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Communication

65
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,800
Associated with

66
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
Disability

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,224
I'm in supervisory control for discrete operation so you think about it

68
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
No impact

69
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,040
No power loss

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,344
New customers would have noticed

71
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
And plenty of backup procedures

72
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,672
Baidu

73
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:47,072
Someone doing electric power control that loses visibility into at least you know

74
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,608
Left on ideal

75
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
So it's it's

76
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
In the same context

77
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,704
Extremely important

78
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,080
Williamson security devices

79
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
And on the other

80
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
Extreme it's no this is not what we're talking about with

81
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,248
Cyberfest created and so forth and Hague

82
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,320
But it's kind of sits right in the middle

83
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
I mean that's the thing right slick what is

84
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
I think we even talked about

85
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
54

86
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
The first time we spoke was

87
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
3 years ago

88
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,280
4 years ago

89
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,095
And you know that the same time

90
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
Line persist

91
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,727
Cyber Pearl Harbor is that even you know is that even possible is assuming it

92
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
That that risk of

93
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,799
That hacker

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
Where hackers are nation-states in the power grid

95
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,687
Turning the lights out is that become more reality or

96
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
Do you think that

97
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
Since you got into this game

98
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
We actually gotten better

99
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:45,695
I think in a lot of ways were getting better combating it but we we kind of have an evolving Landscaping

100
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
If you want to look strategically

101
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,815
At the issues that the industrial Community faces

102
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
One of those

103
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,631
Resounding issues

104
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
Is that we are moving to more homogeneous

105
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,799
Commonality in our infrastructure in the vendors

106
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,383
Applying sites and then maintaining and monitoring them

107
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,967
And the more and more homogeneous are retarded becomes

108
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
The easier it is to

109
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
Scale 1 attack acrostic

110
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
Enter Lottery

111
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,623
The other big scenario is that

112
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:19,487
Get hyped up that really aren't possible become a little bit more possible

113
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,583
Every year if you want to think that way from a technology not quickly

114
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
But it happened

115
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,655
Moving in that direction

116
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,495
I miss largely the heterogeneous ever sucks that we have that

117
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,287
Really makes it

118
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,615
Difficult for some of the types of attacks that but people theorize about

119
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,943
I'm even we talk about electric power grid there's not one

120
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
Bread in the United States

121
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,343
But not as if you're taking down a grade or take it out multiple grits to see that kind of affect

122
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:51,231
So are we moving no more hungry she has ever talked to her a time that does make does attack more scalable yes

123
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
At glacial speed

124
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,071
It's not like meowser

125
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,351
Next year cuz you

126
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,191
I'm by the same time or Defenders are sitting wartime

127
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,823
Forgetting their environments understand were happening on the operations ecology side we're seeing War

128
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,407
People get involvement events of industrial Control Systems every year

129
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,503
I think the balance is what your kind of alluding to with the

130
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,551
Cyber 9/11 and Pearl Harbor

131
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Stop

132
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,087
Is

133
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,695
We need to be thinking about what do those big attacks look like

134
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
And then

135
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,815
Not lose our imagination and what can happen so that we can prepare

136
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,143
But we don't need to freak out the public and thing in it

137
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
These things are really likely that

138
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
Edison power company tencent

139
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Spear phishing email

140
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,287
Doesn't mean lights

141
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
And so that's where the hype

142
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
I'm so I think it's getting better

143
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,479
Yeah I Dreaming is a lot of hype around that and I think some of it has to do with

144
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,807
Some companies trying to Hawk their Wares to

145
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,879
Clients saying you know we can protect against the cyber

146
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Pearl Harbor

147
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,927
You know one thing I did

148
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Even said this to me

149
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
4 is

150
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
Kind of event

151
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,047
Steel hinges on

152
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,655
Actual kinetic Warfare between big nation states like the US and Russia alike

153
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
It's not as if

154
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
Russia

155
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,775
While they may be sitting in our networks right now

156
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:13,407
If he were to do some sort of attack like that that could get link to them and that would create real-world issues

157
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
So why would they do

158
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,855
Vital us infrastructure including the power grid under cyber Threat by Russian government hackers

159
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,695
Potentially giving the Kremlin the ability to turn off the lights

160
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,023
Yeah there's there's always been there as long as long as I

161
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
In doing there's always been The Narrative of

162
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,375
China and Russia have

163
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,727
When are grades that they can activate it anytime

164
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
Causes destruction is only an aspect of intent

165
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,871
Something is really interesting important understand and

166
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
And why they would do something it is

167
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,223
For the same time

168
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,503
Like half a narrative is false

169
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Cuz

170
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
Various State actors

171
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,415
I have the capability to get to get access wherever trucker gas

172
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,743
I'm having some of them has shown us time and time again yes

173
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,559
But it's not like they're waiting in torment with a

174
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,351
Killswitch deployed across the

175
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
Environments is not real

176
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
I need to be shortened big shortening

177
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,799
Yes what are the timeline it would take for them to do something for sure

178
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
But it wouldn't be some immediate thing

179
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
I'm addicted just take advantage of it.

180
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
Quite a bit more

181
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
I'll take ya

182
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Blackstone labs

183
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
But

184
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,135
I do think a lot of people focus a lot of those major events and that's just not what concerns me

185
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,439
But I do think the kinetic world comes into play there

186
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
I didn't gif

187
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:35,071
A Russian State want to take down the Eastern interconnect the United States correctly

188
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,399
We're going to war or something close to it

189
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
And that's

190
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
That's not what freaks me out what freaks me out

191
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,007
It's got to fold one

192
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
Would be the smaller events that don't rise that level

193
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
I could you take out electric power indeed

194
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Zz430

195
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,967
You take out the rule America somewhere for for 30 minutes

196
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,015
Still scare the hell out of population

197
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,111
And have a psychological impact that still probably has impact on policy

198
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,231
And maybe even there's an overreaction in Congress that horses is regulation that affects

199
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,023
Kill the industry overnight yo

200
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
I'm that that's a problem

201
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,119
Or what about adversary getting

202
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:14,751
Into sensitive industrial networks they shouldn't be involved in meteor Refinery or wherever

203
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
And accidentally

204
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
Triple R systems

205
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,127
And cause damage Amelia seen similar before where

206
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,967
In 2014 as an attack on a steel facility in Germany

207
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,295
And by all accounts as it's difficult to know these things

208
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
With pi degrees account

209
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
There's not a lot of

210
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
Brunswick Works in Suffolk

211
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
I'm done but

212
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
By all accounts it looks like the adversary

213
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
Accidentally cause and effect

214
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,095
That led to massive physical destruction across that environment

215
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,375
How do you

216
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,679
Cope with that between states when

217
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,031
1 state looks like they just got attacked by another two might have even been Max

218
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,823
I worry about

219
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,359
States being idiots

220
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,711
Doing things I should be doing and accidentally escalate tensions

221
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,271
And I also worried about some of the smaller

222
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
Time affects where you go

223
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,367
You still have a huge impact but doesn't rise to level one

224
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,487
Look at that the first example that you described as sort of

225
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,351
Perfectly fits in with a lot of adversaries right now looking at the United States looking at 20

226
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,375
820 and just

227
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
Trying to promote General chaos

228
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Trying to create an app

229
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
What category

230
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
The US cover

231
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Yammy I think that

232
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,591
We always think I think

233
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
The Westin Resort

234
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
Pearl Harbor now.

235
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:25,919
Cesar 911

236
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,455
Analogies when it comes

237
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Attacks on

238
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Ourselves

239
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,087
And less about the sort of smaller

240
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,623
Events that could really

241
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,183
Could actually really disrupt us long-term

242
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
Annie's a very fair character

243
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
And I think it's harder sometimes

244
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
If you want to be worried about the large

245
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
Well if you like your powers are no electric

246
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,519
Example letters for more

247
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:56,639
The farmers Archer Hector the entire world I don't like things Avengers are effectively

248
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Industrial companies Bend

249
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:01,247
But the other great always end up being alright.

250
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Example

251
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,831
And we look at electric power if you want

252
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
Change How We Do

253
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,183
Your transmission and generation

254
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Big Lots

255
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
Our sort of sites

256
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
There's a definable

257
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
Number of touch points

258
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,119
And we feel like we have the power to go in

259
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
When you talk about these smaller events you're talking thousands

260
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Two players

261
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
And it becomes

262
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Bar Les

263
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
Definable in terms of

264
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,383
How we're going to get out of that problem and feels almost insurmountable

265
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,711
So it's not only that going after the smaller players

266
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
Still have exiotic effects

267
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
Scare the public

268
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,111
Influence policy and elections and regulations and everything else

269
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,927
But it's also really difficult for the Defenders

270
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,535
Going to scope those issues and and what they actually want to accomplish across all those sites

271
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
I'm so many ways to end up being a really

272
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
Billy smart Target

273
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,447
So your company you say that you track

274
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239
Adversaries at 1

275
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
Disrupt civilization

276
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
How do you track the sepsis

277
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
These are two players

278
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,687
What are you doing how do you vet that they are in fact

279
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
Adversaries

280
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
To civilization

281
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
Like I asked

282
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,903
You know what to do with that like

283
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,487
Company monitor safeguarding civilization with

284
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
I love the idea of that and

285
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
It's not just like big

286
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
Companies that can pay a bill

287
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
Also love

288
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,935
It's not just

289
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,519
Our friends if you really understand you got to take care of civilians

290
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,055
People out there where they

291
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
Yeah living operator

292
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
I think it's hacking

293
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
Structure is

294
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,479
Egregious an RV

295
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:38,015
Against the rules if you will

296
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
Freddy's Dead

297
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Tom brosseau

298
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,647
Technology companies so

299
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:47,231
Most of it's where we have our customers we have our technology deployment Center

300
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,071
And we're in those networks in the middle of arms are getting feedback from

301
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,167
I have an Intel team that essentially takes that day.

302
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,471
Plus bother date around the community and

303
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
I'm Partnerships in

304
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,847
Normal traditional ways of getting access to the data anyways

305
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,663
I'm in turn that data into intelligence about

306
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,479
Exist

307
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:13,855
I think the interesting thing in outside of our company but just for the CEO take away the larger community

308
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,671
Is pre 2014

309
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
I'm the only really talked about 1 or

310
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
2 Industrial Drive

311
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,279
Cell

312
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,375
We talked about like one hour name and then maybe one or two

313
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,679
And when my team

314
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,751
Really try to take it out it looks different 2015

315
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
Enter poking around and we started getting more more

316
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,615
Collection out of the industrial bar men

317
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
Started seeing more more things though

318
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,199
Sackler crackington

319
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
Are nation-states

320
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Team

321
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
Targeting industrial operation

322
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,319
Run the World

323
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
And ends

324
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,159
It's easy to highlight

325
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
Team but I think

326
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
What's more important as an egg at Methodist

327
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
The community is

328
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
As we

329
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
Get better collection we find a lot of

330
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Stop

331
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Bangla narrative

332
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,959
Over the years has been oh well there's not a lot of dust

333
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
And reality weed

334
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,151
Staff had slick Schrodinger's IDs and we just don't look into the enough of that works hoping that's not dead

335
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
And I and I think as we ease

336
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,319
Gone and started looking at these industrial networks and getting access and and and getting a disability

337
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
More more

338
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Becoming a parent

339
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,439
Target all along but

340
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
State some teams in

341
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,791
Tree crafts and things you never seen before

342
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:31,679
I think this time the reasons a targeted organization. Only military and and destruction

343
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
It's hotter than electric Robert

344
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
You want to steal intellectual property of accompanying

345
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,871
Not going to be in the you know the windows email environment it's going to be

346
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,711
And how their manufacturing their goods to the Pharmaceuticals or

347
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:46,271
Or you know how their expert duesing

348
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
Steel and doing a really good way I mean

349
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Massive amount of wealth

350
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
Do you think Mimi nation states that are engaging

351
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,279
I would say mainly Nation

352
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
End

353
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
There

354
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Components

355
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
I mean by that is

356
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
In the same way

357
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,007
We'd expect the United States government to use their defense industrial base

358
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
We're saying

359
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
Exactly the same thing with other states

360
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,383
Where it might be a hacker for hire taipei

361
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
Grouper people that are

362
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,711
Developing exploits for sale

363
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,271
But they're becoming components of Mason City operation

364
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
Without seeing a

365
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
Criminal element by them

366
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
Installs go Target Industrial

367
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,719
We're seeing States would have influenced in

368
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
And operations for the state efforts

369
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,351
Now you know

370
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
There's been a lot of the obvious players kicked around like

371
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,983
China and Russia and even Israel two stomachs

372
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
Stand

373
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
France

374
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
I'll be there

375
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
New big country that have the capability go after

376
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Anchor compass

377
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,199
What about

378
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
Places like Saudi Arabia and Venice

379
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,831
Look at you see the kids around a lot is that true

380
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:58,975
In terms of them being aggressive or then

381
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,559
I think it's fair to say for any modern State and this is

382
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
This goes down the collection like why outside of

383
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
Why don't we hear a lot about NSA operate

384
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:12,031
Wound because they're not really a good

385
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Cyber threat intelligence

386
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Community in China

387
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:17,407
You know or we're not seem like a lot of Russian firms

388
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Doing this type of analysis

389
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,015
What's the closest we get to it as I can cuz Friskies great team doing

390
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:28,927
But it really comes down to like where you're collecting and then announces you're putting on top of it why don't we hear more about

391
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,207
Pakistani

392
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
Cyber threats

393
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
I'm because we're not in the Indian energy

394
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
And so it water is threatened

395
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
Being geopolitical and Regional

396
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,983
I miss it if I can least a crafting until this work happening out on the

397
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,567
Global scale like it would normally but just in this case

398
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,663
And so Venezuela Saudi Arabia Algeria

399
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
Egypt

400
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,527
Brazil leader Neymar play Arthur's sword of a modern

401
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,855
Entity that has a strong intelligent

402
00:16:58,111 --> 00:17:00,415
Community it is a highlight later they have a

403
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
Cyber component do that

404
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,535
They betray irresponsible not to for their own country

405
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,327
And Industrial

406
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
Control Systems rice yes

407
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:14,751
Have you come such a main component of having statecraft and policy influence and Alex property theft

408
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
And it just is a natural evolution

409
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
Getting a lot of cases

410
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
It states tend to try to get parity with

411
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,247
Each other one state have the capability another state wants to be able to have

412
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
I capability as well

413
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,063
And so as we're seeing

414
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
Morley saying seeing a sort of coming to life

415
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,951
It's also very commonly States try to keep up with each other

416
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
No

417
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
You know something big

418
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
Big news

419
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,655
What happened late last night that a lot of people in the infosec community were tweeting about

420
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Today

421
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Was

422
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
That

423
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,007
IDF

424
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567
Apparently undertook an airstrike against some hack

425
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Hamas

426
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
Cyberark

427
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
So I know you have experience in the government

428
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,735
First of all how does

429
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,271
How does one country

430
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
Identify what is cyber operative is

431
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
And

432
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
To your knowledge have you ever heard of

433
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:08,511
The US government or other Western Nations targeting hackers

434
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Core

435
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
Quote unquote

436
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,607
Part of a terrorist organization and

437
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Deemed

438
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,911
Cyber operatives

439
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,471
Yes this is a super wrench

440
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
Just in case and I think

441
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,079
Yeah I do see a lot of that kind of joke and I and I

442
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,895
I'm really not trying to disparage everybody all at once

443
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:28,991
But it is very interesting to see like now ever since New Year's

444
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
And I'm really good technical folks all of a sudden become international relations theorists and Military experts in overnight

445
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,951
It is interesting

446
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,743
It's a it's a real laugh riot

447
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
Auto Sale that is

448
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
Annette specific case

449
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
A lot of glass

450
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,471
You know Israel

451
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
Has a walk lifestyle

452
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:52,799
Target.

453
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
Places they're going to strike and

454
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,943
Excel does a moth another they're going to go after

455
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
And I do the other play attention that reads

456
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,855
And it's and it's unfortunate but they're they're just everything from rocket strikes.

457
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
Proverbial feedback

458
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,951
End

459
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,999
I'm interested to know

460
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,047
If this really was a

461
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,863
We targeted them because it was a cyber components

462
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
And this is what happened

463
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,471
Or if it wasn't just part of the normal

464
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,519
Hey this is the next Target on the list

465
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,799
And let's see if we can

466
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
No

467
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,407
How much do this is PR effectively

468
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,711
And like States messaging to each other

469
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
And how much it is real

470
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,551
But it but let's let's just take it at face value that is

471
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Real

472
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
B

473
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
One of the

474
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
You public cases

475
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,463
If I'm not mistaken

476
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,511
And I wrote this week's Rock This Way

477
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
Just probably just Got7

478
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,839
But a couple years ago there were

479
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
Discussions around

480
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,423
Drone strike specifically targeting

481
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
Cyber

482
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
Experts

483
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,799
Isis and Al Qaeda

484
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:59,103
Effectively that folks that were using

485
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:04,479
This is an owl a recruit people but also see if they can't do someone hacking

486
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Operation

487
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
It was in a release

488
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
Stacy say

489
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,135
I just found one today said

490
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
Dino targeting Isis internet cafe

491
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
Yeah exactly that's why I like without

492
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Star Citizen

493
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Do I think this is

494
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
The first example of

495
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
I'm do I think it is a very

496
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,519
Public high profile examples

497
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
And the fact that

498
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
Israel through an official

499
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Mechanism would still there

500
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,479
Makes me all sorts of sad that Twitter's official mechanisms

501
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,551
But through it official mechanism came out and said this

502
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,855
Purpose of this was to go after

503
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
Aoi cyber operator

504
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Yeah that's

505
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,535
I think it needs to be thought through and and kind of analyzing and

506
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
It would be good to get more information

507
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
Amit is a very important

508
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Events

509
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,543
And from a holiday know who it is or that I was looking at that facility I mean

510
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
Tattoo components that one

511
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,383
We was talking about after

512
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
We should be hard

513
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
But it's not

514
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
Impossible and it's not

515
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,575
Or like it's getting easier over time and what they knocked out hard I don't mean like

516
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
Couple people can figure it out if you like as an adult

517
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,672
Requirements to work towards like

518
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,720
That organizations can really work towards it

519
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Doberman

520
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,304
Really have a hold over that I think

521
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,864
If you're looking at the ability to understand

522
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,144
How would attack happen

523
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
Private sector wins over

524
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
Everything in those Networks

525
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
Therein

526
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,544
Senior tax making patterns out

527
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,824
The best cyber defenses

528
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,616
An innovation or saying that

529
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,432
But in terms of

530
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
Attribution

531
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,552
Government monopoly I like some of these companies have gotten really good at it

532
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,600
But there's also a lot of times.

533
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
The wrong and

534
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:51,232
I'm just nobody called him out or have the ability to call him out like when the last time you seen a major event or come out and go

535
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,768
Oh yeah was an axe

536
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Never

537
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,352
There's no way we're getting it right a hundred

538
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
Is just marketing

539
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
But in this case

540
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:05,056
State of Israel says hey we had after you something that it's highly likely that they did

541
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,872
Usually when states do that they're they're very confident

542
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,432
And

543
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
Yeah especially with ones that are stupid

544
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,808
In the space that is usually not just

545
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,344
CSI cyber forensics

546
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,440
Texas yearly humentum signals intelligence and everything else well

547
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:26,304
And it's not like that Israel doesn't have an amazing human capability around Lawson and then the region

548
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,144
And then you tell it something I'm coughing they came already answer

549
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,264
And I also cannot imagine that Hamas is the most sophisticated in terms of

550
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
Hiding a threesome

551
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,640
So I think it's I think it's less of a case of did they get it right and

552
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
Case of

553
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
Was that at

554
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
Play the purpose of the operation

555
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
What's the kill them based off of

556
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:50,112
You're not being a cyber operator and and what does that mean for the community

557
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,928
Black Nike I think that's one four states that got to work through

558
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,256
Yeah and you think I mean for me my big my big question

559
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,584
I'm not doubting that they are cyber operators

560
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Is it that's what Israel calling

561
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
My question is

562
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:08,800
Is a cyber operator a hacker capable of taking down a power grid or we talkin about

563
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,360
A guy who made a couple memes and is a propagandist

564
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128

00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:20,576
Inflation in that in in the western Nations have done that

567

There there certain

568
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
Their ways of classifying these kinds of

569
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Internet

570
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Operator

583
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,224
Hacked cyber command account

00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:54,880
I clocked in with the default credentials like that's not the same man

585
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,160

It is terrifying we look at

593
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
Space because

594
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,288
Neither of you and definitions of thing let me we seen this one in

Horses

597
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,224
A diffident it is a very thin line in many countries

598
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,040
And so when we see cyber operators doing

599
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,832
Arizona military operation

600
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
What does that actually mean

601
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
Again a very very thin line

602
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,744
