Eagle one package being delivered

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
28 Charming kitten or equation group has become a booming business dozens of so-called threat intelligence

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
Companies keeps having them and sell subscriptions to fees where they provide customers with up-to-date information

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,752
I'm with most advanced cyber criminals

5
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
And government hackers are up to one of the companies with perhaps the best visibility data

6
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,248
Call Telemetry in infosec speak is none other than Google

7
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,648
The internet giant has more than 1.5 billion active users on Gmail more than 1 billion people who

8
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
Use Chrome

9
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,976
And more than 2 billion of their Android phones

10
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
Recording around the world

11
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,584
Today we talked to the person whose job it is

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
Define hackers in that Giants

13
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,448
Like really really really Giants

14
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
Haystack

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,312
Shane Huntley is the director threat analysis group

16
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,592
Also known as tag

17
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
Google

18
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,176
Existential Google's hacker hunting team

19
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
The other ones task monitoring who's networks for criminal and government hackers

20
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,208
Okay so tell me what it is exactly you do with Google

21
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
My job title is on the director of the

22
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
Analysis

23
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
I was a part of Google security

24
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,424
Analysis group

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Is

26
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752
Something the Company formed about 9 years ago

27
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
To deal with

28
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,104
Serious and government threats against Google Now use

29
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
So

30
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
Are on the team that

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Specifically looks at

32
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,504
Trying to understand

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,296
Over Frets out there the

34
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,624
Are threats to a site uses

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
How we can detect them how we can prevent some

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,744
How can just drop them to keep values the same

37
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
Domingo is that

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,352
There is a lot more stressed out there

39
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,656
Apcu novel threats.

40
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
Suddenly

41
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:19,520
Abby company like Google really needs to defend against so we're the team that does that

42
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,104
So I definitely had friends before who've gotten some of these

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,176
Is emails from Google where they say stuff like

44
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
Your account

45
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,760
Has been attacked by a nation-state actor

46
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,040
And

47
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:31,808
You know you need to

48
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Responses to

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:40,256
How are you so sure when you send an email like that where you said is a nation-state actor cuz it's occurred to me that that seems like a pretty strong

50
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:41,280
Something to send to somebody

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
So the black one out their ID

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,472
Out of the person that came up with you some push this through Windows a lot of

53
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
Scepticism even do this in the first place

54
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
It wasn't doing it for quite a while now

55
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
And

56
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
It seems to have a good effect

57
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
Slacks off acacia

58
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
Actually send it Valera

59
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:04,832
Yellow warning alert directly in the browser because

60
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,624
We don't want people to copy this is an email

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
Sucks you should actually see it

62
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
In the browser cell phone

63
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
I'd like a pop-up

64
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,816
Warning indicator

65
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:21,984
Is that we've seen something weather has fishing with us malware or some other Behavior

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
That

67
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:27,360
We're pretty confident that in a matches what we understand to be the sole

68
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,200
Technics oil specific indicators associated with

69
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
Scuf impact

70
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
Traductor

71
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,088
200 defense read actively tracking some way

72
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
And

73
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
The cause of that

74
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,696
We believe that that's a special message you should

75
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,024
Steve Madden

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
You know so

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,376
We can't tell you all the details but we want to tell people that

78
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,168
You know you really should think about this

79
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,984
And we don't know exactly what action you should take in most cases

80
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,032
Give you some suggestions but

81
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
Really depends on who you are

82
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,616
But the fact that you're being targeted

83
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Some people Wild

84
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
Reciprocity

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
Some people has a big surprise and I might need to change things

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
We really try and provide the information

87
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,952
As you said the still a possibility of false positives especially if it's the security researcher doing research areas

88
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,744
We're pretty confident we can tell the difference

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Between what looks like

90
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,351
Got meds for back to work and what looks like say PrimeWay

91
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
You might want to get into the

92
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,007
Starting to blend those lines a little bit as the year

93
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Okay so

94
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,871
You send that alert when there's an attempt or when they're actually hacked

95
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Attempts

96
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
So it's a sign of targeting

97
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
Notice on compromise compromise

98
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
We immediately like

99
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:44,159
Title is actions help with security town. I change those things

100
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
What is an addition to that

101
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,487
When we seen some form of the tents

102
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,863
We actually let everybody know that we seen some attempt against

103
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
Information

104
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
Anderson something about

105
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
4000 yuan

106
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
Amongst the crossover

107
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
Gmail and Google service

108
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,895
State-sponsored attacks

109
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,247
Is somewhat rare compared to all the big things but is still a fan volume

110
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
Compared to what some people would imagine

111
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
Tecumseh State actors

112
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
What types of people are they

113
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Normally targeting is it

114
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
Say journalists

115
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,535
I think it runs the gamut I think this

116
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
You know

117
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095
Governments these days

118
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
Espionage

119
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,703
Buy soda for the local Security Services will start today

120
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,007
International Security Services

121
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
I see a wide range of what

122
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
The different Trek routes go off

123
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
Summer

124
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:39,455
Going out to people because of pot of they like Espionage Mission so might be going off the like

125
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
High-level government officials

126
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Some people are going off to

127
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,087
Journalist slacktivist is speaking out of

128
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
It's going off for individuals

129
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,439
It really runs quite the gamut

130
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
And

131
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Pretty much anybody who's interested

132
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
Entresto has information that's valuable

133
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
One of these

134
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
Staples

135
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,263
First Imagine and

136
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
Sometimes he blasted

137
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,663
You think this is a democracy

138
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
Be quite different to say somebody who would win

139
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:15,551
You're one of the major political parties in the US that quite different immigrants

140
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,135
Either the same or slightly different redactive

141
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,487
Where where are these attacks being born from I'm sure you have an idea

142
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
I think the big

143
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,119
Is that all over the world

144
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Alcohol

145
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,167
Is that

146
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
Most Nations

147
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,263
Any sort of sizes

148
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,335
Is the keishin now actually having some form of

149
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:42,175
Hacking program that we can fit a pot of this

150
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
We not sign

151
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:48,063
We don't just want about somebody coming from Russia we don't want about just somebody coming from North Korea

152
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,391
Every month we actually take the full range of everything we've seen

153
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,695
Are we really like

154
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,839
You know sometimes we going people and Country Aida didn't tell you like country be at the same time he wanting a plain country bathing talking to buy

155
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Country I

156
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
We are

157
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
Icon of goal is to

158
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,983
Really wanted to take or I use against all

159
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:06,751
States

160
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,335
That's it a few years ago I mean motherboard apologist story

161
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,943
And it was on the report that was Sheriff s called peering into the aquarium

162
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
It was a reference

163
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
To the name of Jerry's headquarters in in Moscow

164
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
Tell me more about that

165
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,367
Yeah I do believe my name is

166
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,743
That is a paper we wrote and excited

167
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
We do look at all the 4th actors out there

168
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
Ads

169
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:36,191
Yeah I think this nobody is working and sweating until that isn't looking at rush hour on the attacks in some way

170
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:39,263
Of course every major power including Russia

171
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,079
Is applier in times of doing attacks against

172
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
Why are people on the internet so

173
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199
Definitely it's right after we take seriously when we woke up

174
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,343
So there's no discrimination is what I'm hearing would that also include the United States targeting different people

175
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Yes I think

176
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,463
We definitely do not like to give a free pass

177
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
Anybody to hack I use

178
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,047
We have our defenses

179
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
We are looking to

180
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,703
Warn anybody receiving time to buy fishing on malware

181
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
And

182
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
Finding useful as possible about the

183
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:15,359
So are you staying for the trends in the

184
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
In the global cyber security

185
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
Parking space

186
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
Right now is that a lot of these

187
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
No tools

188
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
And agencies

189
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,367
Are proliferating

190
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
But you let's say you know 10 years ago you would have had

191
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:34,815
Have the big three operators a big four or five or six and now you're looking at a whole landscape

192
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
45

193
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,143
Different nations or is it you know is it a hundred

194
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,031
Yes exactly right is definitely the number of factors

195
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
1

196
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,151
Just people seems more effective so that investing capabilities locally

197
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,735
Is Osiris Market from providers that

198
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,039
You know a couple hundred thousand dollars will get you

199
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
B series turbo kit

200
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,159
It's from some of the providers out there that is selling to

201
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,439
A range of different

202
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,463
Countries and times

203
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:10,143
The other thing that we're really seeing is that just a tooling off-the-shelf what you can download off the internet to do this sort of attacks

204
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
Really becoming easy

205
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Fat

206
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:19,359
You know some of the tools that I've been used by penetration testers about Security Professionals are also being a

207
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,431
Easley used by government

208
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
What's you like go off

209
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,503
We'll see some to like you

210
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
Powershell Empire

211
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
Which is like a

212
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,439
Download Rocky Harbour some other side

213
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
I was saying that use by a range of different nations in their attacks and we feel like a fishing platform like evil jinx

214
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Again

215
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
Philly Bible on GitHub

216
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
Quite well written used

217
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,215
Penetration tester

218
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
Mixing of things actually does make detection harder

219
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,615
Working out what's what

220
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
It also makes it very easy games any niacin to get into

221
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Is your a

222
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,039
Even a very small nation and you have a very small intelligence budget

223
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,391
Like really the cost of Entry here is like are a couple of University students

224
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,023
Get them to download some selfies and dad and I can stop fishing people hacking people wear if they wanted to get into like

225
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,607
Running human operations of the CEO building spy satellite

226
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
Serious amounts of money

227
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
Really.

228
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:20,287
Most approachable way for any country to do Espionage I think everyone's like that

229
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,127
Have you seen some really surprising countries get into the game in that way

230
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:31,039
Yeah we have nothing. Just seeing really surprising Soto small parts of countries as well like

231
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
You'll see

232
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:37,439
You know it's something really local police like local police a local Security Services like

233
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Somewhere

234
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Almost

235
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
The city level in x

236
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
People started to use these

237
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,863
I could go against local criminals

238
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
Local stratso look like today

239
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,239
Stop it doesn't need to be beat up a national capability

240
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
And we danced all the way down to like

241
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,103
Sub-regions or even really small countries to do the basics

242
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,455
I need massages developing nations are there because you know you look at something like

243
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
The hacking team

244
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
Revelations icon

245
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,063
Came out there was University campus cops

246
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
Does capabilities

247
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
United States

248
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
Absolutely and that's the biggest differences

249
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,951
Dislike

250
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,791
Between like disease days more about the intent Rollin the tool

251
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,839
Supposed to be used in all sorts of different ways

252
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
Even seeing

253
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
People going off to like

254
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,239
Domestic abuse local people

255
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,031
Like going out the members of

256
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,847
What an abusive relationship going after spouse Princeton

257
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Actually seeing some of

258
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
Saints Row hacking tools been used

259
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
Nation-states

260
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,247
This is a technique

261
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
2

262
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Gain access

263
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,063
People's information

264
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,975
Now when it comes to through this proliferation of of intelligence agencies using his

265
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:43,743
Capabilities

266
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,583
There's also been a proliferation of threat intelligence companies coming out

267
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
With the latest report saying

268
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,191
This person's done this or naming something

269
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,031
Some group a funky name but whatever one knows what it is

270
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
Fancy bear

271
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
For example

272
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
Do you ever

273
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,175
Look at those and think yourself now we've been looking

274
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
The same group

275
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
You think that's pretty much like

276
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
You know

277
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,807
What I think

278
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Is one of the

279
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,183
One of the benefits teams around the world and we definitely talk to cowpots

280
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,743
But the commercial industry also

281
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,071
With like the other major players such as like my counterparts and yellow

282
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
Micheladas company

283
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
On the hallway scene different paths

284
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
The same picture

285
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
It's like that old parable of the elephant

286
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,335
People looking at different some people are starting to see the trunk

287
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,479
I think most of us in the world to stop and Converge on a reasonable understanding about what's going on out there

288
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,599
I think it is interesting that you know The Branding and the condo

289
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
Commercialization of the

290
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:49,023
Play supposed to go down. Bad in this world that's the

291
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,863
Able to respond to motivations both attackers and Defenders

292
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
So

293
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,959
Go to where I can get

294
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:02,079
What are the vehicles that the Defenders security industry everyone else is trying to work out in

295
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,151
How do we turn into products different variants

296
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
Jason X

297
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,295
Is it security company is a goal to make you secure or is it legal to MyQ

298
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
Afraid so you buy more

299
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
Probably a little bit of thought

300
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
Trying to balance those motivation

301
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Episode that

302
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
I need 50 Ava need to be able to get out there means.

303
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:26,143
Play publishing World. Which has the real good side that we have

304
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
Json sharing

305
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
The downside is that

306
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
Sometimes it does make it harder to track things as

307
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:37,151
People immediately chasing the publicity in the new hall of fame versus the what can we do to really think about this rock

308
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
I mean Google has one of the

309
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Better

310
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,015
Threat analysis team

311
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,599
Because you also have one of the biggest data set that Google must be attacked

312
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,671
More Time by nation states than almost anywhere else

313
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
In the world

314
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
I don't know about the attacks

315
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Statistics

316
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,583
Definitely say that we definitely do

317
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
Get a lot of disability

318
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Suppose we have so many used

319
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
And because we had so many uses of a sad like

320
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,775
I used to being targeted by Spaceballs for the taxes

321
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
4000

322
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,639
So it does allow us to see the

323
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
A picture

324
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
I also think I'm very lucky

325
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
Italo technology to draw

326
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
That was a lot of

327
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599
Initial analysis

328
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,463
Swell a lot of us about actually understanding the day this is what a big data problems be processing problems

329
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,279
I just wanting the Google you know has

330
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
Ability to process large massive diet

331
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,423
Engineers building like large-scale system

332
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
So we can sit through

333
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,495
Medabots of malware

334
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,519
We can like

335
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,567
Deploy things directly

336
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
To do protections into Gmail

337
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
Miss y'all thing I really like about the team

338
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Is that

339
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,991
Are we not just producing summer pool at the postal website

340
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,647
95% is like a teligence or more is directly going to the people who are defending

341
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,743
Google actually building the systems in defense the surest adjusting the defenses

342
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,303
Try nicely block this in real time

343
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
I think we're having quite a

344
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Identify this problem

345
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
Making your taxes with a lotta

346
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:08,031
So I mean in some ways would you say that you're getting better information and RB

347
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,567
Becoming better prepared to face

348
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,871
These kinds of attacks and even say the US government

349
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,431
Because you're getting seems to be

350
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
I mean just talks

351
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Anthem

352
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,527
I think everybody has his strengths write like

353
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,855
U.s. government has like their own advantages

354
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,671
192 US government.

355
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:27,743
Google likes younes comment on government spying us Steel

356
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Huge

357
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,071
Also they have was not pausing

358
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
Intelligence agencies have

359
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,679
Super secret things to the laws allow them to do that

360
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
You know somebody in

361
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
Cobra setting

362
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
Jerry Strickland

363
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
Play sings by the book

364
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Isn't able to do

365
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,127
So did we have different views

366
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
But I do think that

367
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
The days off

368
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
Yeah the government having a monopoly on this understanding and it's always locked up secret understanding what's going on that's so much better than any

369
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:56,159
Anybody else engulfment is really busy. I think

370
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Did Connor

371
00:15:57,695 --> 00:16:01,023
Strong thread until team buses mine or some of the bee commercial ones

372
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
I definitely must want an evil

373
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Even footing with

374
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,191
Sort of like big five eyes governments are all the golf Missoula

375
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
But then I told me everything I know as well right so

376
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
I don't know

377
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
Will I have some magic noise

378
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
That's not available

379
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
People on the outside

380
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,295
I got asked to I mean you must be pulling some of your employees nusret intelligence

381
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
From those exact cover

382
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,111
In the Bible

383
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,999
I have a few people to come from that world including myself way back in the day

384
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
Like almost 9 years ago now

385
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,119
There is some company company

386
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,191
It's surprising it's only a couple actually that if

387
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
How much water rain sexually

388
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
What about

389
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
The whole DNC

390
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Hacking

391
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
Phenomena that happened

392
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,503
Did Google see any of those same actors

393
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,575
In their servers going after their Gmail accounts

394
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,183
We did not have any

395
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Logic

396
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
The same way.

397
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
NSAIDs

398
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,071
Did those same groups

399
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,143
Did you see them actively trying to go after your network

400
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Or your Gmail

401
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,007
I definitely give the definitely was targeting of

402
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
During the

403
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
No public nature of this week

404
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Regards to

405
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,943
Gmail uses with targeted

406
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,807
During the campaign and even leaks around them they should have been in the same time frame and 26

407
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
Mini pig clothes

408
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,647
By the Saints redacted

409
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:35,999
The DNC hacks and also some of the legal operations so

410
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
Isopoda like

411
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
Lodgic Champaign

412
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
It was

413
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Going on at that time

414
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,215
So in terms of the threat intelligence analysis

415
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:51,103
Group do you ever have any political fears of disclosing some of the things you find because

416
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,479
Obviously Google has commercial interests and threat intelligence is just completely

417
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,503
You know open

418
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
In terms of what you're finding

419
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
But you know

420
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:06,207
You could upset Nations I've seen you to look at something like citizen lab when they find something out about a certain country

421
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,023
If there's a political blowback is that something that you're

422
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,095
Faces as well I think it's something that everybody has to think of

423
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,655
To certain degree but I suppose the

424
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
Harvesting

425
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
It's like

426
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
General rule is

427
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,567
Not to

428
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,199
You know tight sides but not really that food pushing in order to like push a political agenda

429
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
Archangel Street

430
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,015
Quit here in the facts that

431
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,575
We're trying to defend our systems now uses against

432
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
And

433
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
I think

434
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:41,279
When we take that approach as opposed to a more activist approach like some of these other groups I think that puts us in a better position

435
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
I hate to stand on

436
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
Anytime softer why we doing

437
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,215
Playing favorites will not picking sides without trying to

438
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
Used to some political measure because

439
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,871
The company wants right this isn't a cool business a cool businesses

440
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
Allowing people to

441
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,015
Use that services to use the internet and

442
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:05,599
Always security attacks wrestlers getting in the way of that so

443
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,159
We just want to solve the problem to allow using

444
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
Cuz I mean I guess you know any any

445
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Broken

446
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,791
The internet is broken it's broken forever

447
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,607
Absolutely and if the trust in the internet

448
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,655
Is broken as well it'll say just limits wallpaper

449
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,679
Can do like

450
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,215
Always attacks actually

451
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:25,311
Make it so people don't want to use the internet they conquered the benefits because

452
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:29,407
Spinning without having to worry about attack so they worried about using

453
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,687
Information so

454
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:35,295
You know we want people to be secure we won't be able to get all the benefits of this technology in

455
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
Don't have to spend their entire lives having to

456
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Nope

457
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,695
Because really worried about threats Golfland Factor otherwise

458
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
And how about your

459
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:48,095
You know Google's relationship with businesses in terms of disclosing what's going on if

460
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,631
They're being particularly

461
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
Targeted

462
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,215
Is that something you do actively

463
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
Cuz he misses well-liked definitely fry businesses

464
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,919
On G Suite Navasota products and something responding to do

465
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,991
We also do a lot of like engagement industry in flag

466
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,831
You know we definitely make the calls to different people would have some sort of tea attack

467
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,439
I promise to give like white glove service everybody on the planet but

468
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,279
What's something serious out there we definitely doing gauge very strongly

469
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:22,655
What are all the things we've been doing more recently is like really looking for exploits out there in the wall as well as

470
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,679
We found that

471
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
What sound exploits

472
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
Seem like you know

473
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
Summer competitors

474
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,895
Somebody using eggs exploit against Microsoft

475
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,503
Look at the teams pushed and the patch

476
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
Turn around 2

477
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,343
Help paying security products against active attacks

478
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,183
Bosporus your face see something being using his that products we didn't expect that

479
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,975
Dentsu

480
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,279
Provide information about some hole.

481
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:56,191
In 2013 after the Snowden leaks a lot of these big companies like Google like the big telcos

482
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
Etcetera

483
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
You know a lot of people lost a lot of trust

484
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,615
And what your company does another companies do with data and terms of it

485
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
It's relationship Visa V government

486
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
When

487
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,551
Users are using the stuff in your at your collecting threat intelligence cetera

488
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,391
I mean how how can you sort of make people believe that

489
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,208
Google has Andrew threat intelligence group

490
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
Have their best interests

491
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Adhar

492
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:23,584
And that you know in terms of government disclosure and their data

493
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
They're not going to see any any

494
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
Let's say attacks on their privacy

495
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Degree you have to work out

496
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
And how they behave

497
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
I do think so

498
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,592
2013 Snowden leak

499
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
Swear

500
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
You know

501
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,944
A huge Advantage for us.

502
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,992
The whole industry and how everybody thought about

503
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,272
Technology in golf

504
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,856
I do think what we do need to say is that

505
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
We do

506
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,952
Have a pretty strong history of

507
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,488
Pushing back on the golf man

508
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,024
Really trying to be independent

509
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,816
We are an international company

510
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,864
That tries to

511
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
Yoda Fable II uses

512
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
But also

513
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,752
We have to think about the range

514
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
That I think

515
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
One of the downsides of

516
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Snowden leaks

517
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,200
Is that you had everybody worried for a long time so lie about

518
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Anna Seifert

519
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,016
That's not thinking

520
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,392
What's the tension from some of the other day threat actors out there for numbers

521
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,976
I think I actually happened frudel 2016 with

522
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
What's the election

523
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,840
Interference accusations that

524
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,168
Now some people realizing that yes there is this water range

525
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
Actors out there Beyond

526
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
Just worrying about what it was

527
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
What Snowden published

528
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,824
Is there a group out there in particular

529
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
That keeps you up at night in terms of 8

530
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:46,016
I think the group must keep me up at night is the one that I don't know about

531
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,552
In times of the

532
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:50,624
Who is that the one that I really know about

533
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,416
I feel that I'm really able to the fan

534
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,464
But there's always that out there

535
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,256
Should we haven't had a really big incident

536
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,024
Long time

537
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Again, Google

538
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,584
And

539
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,680
Is there some active

540
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
Comforters that I don't know about

541
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Song

542
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:12,128
Group whether it is like you know probably paid mercenaries will somehow 18 from some golf

543
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,712
We do everything we can to look for them we haven't seen the oven

544
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
It's always in the back of my mind

545
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
That we have to be ready

546
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,136
Trying to look at how to catch them if they did

547
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:28,256
You see any Trends in terms of attacks by apts

548
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,048
Out there on Gmail at 8

549
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
Gdb like

550
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:38,240
Going after two Factor authentication goes back in 2016 it was fishing automated phishing email

551
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Attempts at

552
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,032
Gmail

553
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,104
So I mean is there anything else you're seeing that's

554
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
This come out

555
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,688
Caltrans one is the

556
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,992
Yunnan normal focus on mobile devices

557
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,296
Centigrade so trying to either

558
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:55,648
Triple push users to install things on their phones or two

559
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:56,928
Yourtronics black people

560
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
It's very important very interesting that I think

561
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,424
As more and more people use spotify two-factor codes

562
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,496
Looking at you no send fire SMS OST Barn app

563
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,360
The series attack isn't even the sort of mid-level serious attack is

564
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
Getting

565
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
Bitterroot freaking uses

566
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:20,480
Misunderstood

567
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Kings Inn

568
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
Security

569
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,088
Even among Security Professionals is the

570
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,392
Occasionally

571
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
Fat

572
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,024
If it's a six-digit code and you're entering into a website then

573
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Just as much as I can

574
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Your password

575
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,448
But something like the

576
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,984
Fido security keys

577
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
GBK make some of

578
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Muhammad

579
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
The used ones

580
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
That really so twice

581
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
Websites

582
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
A copy Fists

583
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
The really works

584
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,736
Multi-factor Authentication

585
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
What's

586
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,576
Against certain attacks like you know

587
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,392
It really protects you against your password in your password dump

588
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
Password reuse

589
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
Bought

590
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:06,048
That kind of the code entering ones I think of being able to be stolen by more more

591
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,096
You know more serious attackers

592
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
And then that's the

593
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:13,984
The thing that worries me is well that people think did the two-factor Authentication

594
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,008
Magic Bullet

595
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,336
Sign up for it you could be a SMS message and then you totally unhackable

596
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
That's certainly not the truth

597
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:25,760
Is the Pledge time to get as I mentioned before of the

598
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
The mixing together

599
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:30,880
State-sponsored all the word of the world like

600
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:36,768
North Korea spends more of a time trying to steal Bitcoin these days

601
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:43,168
It's been a trying to like get National Intelligence from all week until so

602
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,944
Makes it hard for me to draw the line about where I should be putting my assets

603
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,040
