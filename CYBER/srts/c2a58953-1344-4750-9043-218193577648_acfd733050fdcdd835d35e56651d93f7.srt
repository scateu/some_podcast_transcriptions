1
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:13,568
Maria's email account recently been broken into

2
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,616
So when news broke out

3
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,152
That the Ashley Madison

4
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
Might have been hacked

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:21,760
The fault of her information being where it shouldn't

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,040
What's fresh in her mind

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,696
Using an online search she decided to check if I email wasn't somehow registered on the site

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,120
Thinking nothing of it she also put in her fiance's email address

9
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,960
Suffice to say

10
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
The wedding was canceled

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
Rick's marriage

12
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,432
What's going on for two decades

13
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,736
I had a couple of kids to show for it

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
Somewhere along the way

15
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,832
He and his wife had lost

16
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,464
Perhaps it was his 3 hours commute to a tiring corporate job

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,512
Or her overwhelming duties

18
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,792
Real estate Houma

19
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
Rick

20
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,144
Hit a full-on midlife crisis

21
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,472
Buying motorcycle even getting a tattoo

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,312
He was on a binge for things exciting

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,408
It led to him thinking about an affair

24
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:25,504
He never did anything with his Ashley Madison account

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
But after the site got hacked

26
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,904
Rick received a blackmail letter threatening to reveal his membership

27
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
Instead of calling the bluff

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,536
Rick owned up to his wife about what he done

29
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
She left out

30
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
The front door

31
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
That evening

32
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
Luckily for WIC

33
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
Cheap eventually return home the next morning

34
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056
He and her

35
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:52,128
We're about to begin a long journey to Healing

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
John was a pastor

37
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
Magic

38
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:07,744
He had a wife and two children and in his spare time he enjoyed restoring automobile

39
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,352
John had struggled with depression and addiction in his past

40
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,216
But was known among his students is a great teacher with a penchant for fun

41
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,336
John's name was included in Ashley Madison delete user accounts

42
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,432
Before his wife was able to find that out for herself

43
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,968
She found his body

44
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504
And suicide note

45
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,328
It was bunkers

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
It was completely crazy

47
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:50,240
Because the media grabs hold of this story

48
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,824
Like no data breach that I've ever seen before

49
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
And

50
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
I think when you know the details of what the Ashley Madison website was designed to do its maybe no surprise

51
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:07,392
That the British tabloid the Press around the world TV stations radio everybody

52
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,720
Wanted to talk about this adultery said we should be next

53
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
Hi I'm around Levi

54
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,544
Welcome back to the malicious Life podcast by cybereason

55
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,176
Ashley Madison is a website for cheating spouses

56
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
Sort of like a reverse eHarmony

57
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
Maybe an emerald

58
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Tinder

59
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,904
The service is owned and operated by Avid life media Incorporated

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Heretofore referred to as a

61
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
Now under the name Ruby Corporation

62
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
Based in Toronto Canada

63
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
Noel biderman founded the company

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,496
And could most often be found in suggestive promotional photographs

65
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,032
Smiling Pepe

66
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
Creepily

67
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
With one finger to his lips

68
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,712
Due to the covered nature of the Ashley Madison service

69
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
Most of the public has been either unaware of his

70
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
Existence

71
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,600
Sheer popularity

72
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
Need to clean for example

73
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:17,024
Do use a base of 37 million people from over 40 different countries

74
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
One point

75
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,399
Just seem to be an outlandish Lehigh number

76
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
When Ashley Madison got hacked

77
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
Made International headlines

78
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Why

79
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
Because it wasn't

80
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,615
Just the major events

81
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
It demonstrated

82
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:36,479
How does information even more sensitive

83
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,527
Even more significant

84
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,367
Then your credit card or your social security number

85
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
You'll see

86
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
July 19th

87
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,119
2015

88
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,447
It was 9 p.m. on a Sunday night

89
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
Brian Krebs

90
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
An infosec blogger

91
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,847
Received an email from an anonymous informant

92
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
We are the impact

93
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:13,087
We have hacked Alm completely taking over their entire office and production domains and

94
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
Thousands of systems

95
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:20,767
And over the past few years have taken all customer information databases complete source code

96
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
Repositories

97
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,071
Financial records

98
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,399
Documentation and emails as we prove here

99
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
And it was easy

100
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
For company

101
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
Who's main promises secrecy it's like you didn't even try like you thought you had never

102
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Pissed anyone off

103
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:43,807
Alm has been instructed to take Ashley Madison and establishment offline permanently

104
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
In all forms

105
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:51,231
We will release all customer records including profiles with all the customers secret sexual fantasy

106
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,791
And matching credit card transactions

107
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
Real names and addresses

108
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,143
An employee documents and emails

109
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,263
Established men for backgrounds

110
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,311
Is another Alm site

111
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,127
Which connects young women do sugar daddies

112
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
A hacker or Packers calling themselves the impact team had just posted this online Manifesto

113
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,319
Website

114
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,135
Call survivinginfidelity.com

115
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,719
Claiming to have stolen all of the airline companies data

116
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,791
To demonstrate that they were serious

117
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,399
The impact team included some of Ashley medicines internal data in the post

118
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,215
Including samples of user information

119
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,031
And the mapping of the company's internal Network

120
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,967
Reaction to the first Ashley Madison data dump

121
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
Was Swift and loud

122
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
It became international news

123
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,623
And 37 million people around the world

124
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
Begin to hyperventilate

125
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,719
YCO nobleman

126
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
Personally admitted to reporters what happened

127
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,143
Publicly as Ashley Madison customer service lines became overloaded

128
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,679
Company Representatives

129
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
Refuse to acknowledge

130
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
The legitimacy of the attack

131
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,871
Those who called in with questions and complaints in those first days

132
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
We're giving a range of

133
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,991
Excuses or simply disconnected from the line

134
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,063
Now there was a ticking clock

135
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,903
What they comply or call the hackers Bluff

136
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:28,255
The company was able to wipe the hackers original later from the internet

137
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
North bitumen

138
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
Seem to believe they'd caught the Copa

139
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
He told Brian kerbs quote

140
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:39,007
We're on the doorstep of confirming who we believe is the culprit

141
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,103
And unfortunately that may have triggered this messed up location

142
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
I've got their profile

143
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Right in front of me

144
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
Older Works Prudential

145
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,623
It was definitely a person here that was not an employee but suddenly had tests are technical service

146
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Import

147
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,743
The press release from the company ended with a quote

148
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,791
From Kaufman, TX

149
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
Quote

150
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,583
I have no doubt

151
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,399
Based on the work I and my company are doing

152
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,215
Will continue to be strong

153
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Secure

154
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Banquet

155
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Keyboards

156
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
Continue to be

157
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,687
It didn't appear that the company would be begging down from the fight

158
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
Behind the scenes a LMU is much about their hacker at the moment of bitters men statement

159
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,903
As you do about the same hacker

160
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Right now

161
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,743
Still with the faith of the company at stake

162
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Something had to be done

163
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,863
Whoever the impact team was

164
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,887
They were careful

165
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
To cover their tracks

166
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,007
The dump to sneak peek of The Stolen data on the dark web

167
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:48,895
Only accessible via an anonymous Network client that leaves no trace of its users

168
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
Information about it leaked out

169
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
Anonymous tips to the media

170
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,367
Within the doors of Alm no trace of intrusion was found

171
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
In essence

172
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
The criminal robbed the house

173
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,207
And left

174
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,023
No DNA no fingerprints behind

175
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,607
Really all researchers had to go on

176
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Was the day date

177
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,679
And speculation

178
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,775
I am Steve Regan senior staff writer at CSO online

179
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:21,663
And one of the reporters who covered the Ashley Madison stuff back in 2015

180
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
There are some context clues

181
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,295
You can take away from the communications englishes

182
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,087
Probably not their first language

183
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,439
They are proficient in English so they've been educated

184
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
They know

185
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:40,351
Networking hacker parlance but when it came to sentence structure and things like this

186
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
They weren't

187
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Fluid

188
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:46,495
Like a natural speaker would be they were more

189
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
It's hard to describe what I'm thinking here they thought they were

190
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,687
They were not Nuance like a natural speaker would be like

191
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
But fluid and in the conversation you and I are having

192
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,319
The nature of the breach

193
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343
Is evidence

194
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,695
That it must have been conducted by a current or former employee

195
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Because who else

196
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
Could have had that level of excess

197
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
Internal databases

198
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Right

199
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,447
Notice how this was all based in speculation

200
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
John McAfee

201
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,335
McAfee Security claim with 100% confidence

202
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,407
That Alm hack was an inside job

203
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
Also claimed to be sure

204
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
Of the hackers

205
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:28,991
Gender

206
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
How

207
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
Because they refer to men as goldenport scumbags and emphasized Valentine's Day in the

208
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Manifesto

209
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
You see what I'm saying here

210
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
Nobody

211
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
Really knew anything

212
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
It didn't help either

213
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
That

214
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,263
Didn't have much of a security apparatus in place

215
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:56,639
One would imagine that for a company that deals in secret sexual affairs

216
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,711
Security would have been of highest priority

217
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Minuet

218
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:05,343
An analysis of Ashley Madison's cyber defense infrastructure after

219
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
The Heckard

220
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,927
Experts pointed out to some notable

221
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,791
If not glaring flaws and how they handle their ultrasensitive data

222
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,119
Here's Graham cluley cyber-security journalist

223
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
Unblock

224
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,167
We do know

225
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:24,799
There's some of that security was quite weak for instance at first the passwords which were exposed

226
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:28,639
We thought they would significantly strong enough and

227
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:32,223
Well nothing tripped but enough that they can easily be tracked and then

228
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,295
It was late to reveal the actually they were bugs

229
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:40,159
In the coding done by a flea medicine so. I think it's something like 15 million

230
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
What's the password

231
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,487
We're relatively easy to crack

232
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:49,375
And once again we have the problem there a people reusing passwords on multiple sites

233
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
The finding Graham is referring to

234
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,775
Come from the work of a hacking team called cynosure Prime

235
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,615
Cynosure is a small group with small following

236
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,199
Epiphyseal themselves as a password research Collective

237
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,527
Their work on the Ashley Madison data dump

238
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,087
Was anything but modest

239
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:13,695
All in all revealing almost as much about Alm minutes users

240
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
SVP

241
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Deem themselves did

242
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:20,607
Understand how they did it you have to know

243
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,167
About cryptography principal called

244
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Hashing

245
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
You know those people with

246
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
Really convoluted signatures

247
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,639
They can be really nice or really messy

248
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Either way

249
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
You're like

250
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,479
How in the world did he get from

251
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,063
Rent Levy to that jumble of nonsense scribbles

252
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
It's kind of like that

253
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
But for computer

254
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
Different hash algorithms

255
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,767
Work in different ways

256
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,815
But in each case you start off

257
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
With a file

258
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,911
Whether it be a movie page of text anyting

259
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,983
And the bits of information that make up that 5

260
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Get process

261
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
The algorithm

262
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,639
The result will be a number that might seem totally random

263
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
But crucially

264
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,455
Just like a signature

265
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,063
Each hash is the specific result of the input data it represents

266
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
Even if my signature appears random to you

267
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
It's not

268
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,975
It's a specifically based on my name

269
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
And it's not subject

270
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
To change

271
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,815
Regardless of the day

272
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,423
Time how I'm feeling when I write it how many times I write it

273
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Why I'm running it

274
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
What I ate just before I wrote it

275
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Anyting

276
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,567
Bottom line is

277
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,127
That cashes need to appear random

278
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,967
So that they review nothing about the data they represent

279
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:44,319
However because they aren't random steak and theoretically

280
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
Beat reverse-engineered

281
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,207
Team Ashley Madison Case most of the passwords or hash

282
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
Orcutt the graphically obscured

283
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:57,119
Using strong hashing function that would make them practically Bulletproof

284
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Reverse engineering

285
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,567
However 15 million of those 36 million hashed passwords stored in their database

286
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,615
Contains a specific variable

287
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,919
Token Spanish War called

288
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,759
Dollar sign login key hash using md5

289
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,703
Md5 is a hash algorithm designed in 1991

290
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,799
By 2004 md5 what's considered broke

291
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
What does this mean

292
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
Hashes are built to be

293
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,199
Fast but not too far

294
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,063
Fast so that the hatching process doesn't take so long

295
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,879
And not too fast because any hash

296
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
That's so quick process

297
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,207
Is also quick

298
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
Crack

299
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
Md5

300
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,815
He's kind of like the 90's boy band

301
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
Cryptographic hash function

302
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:06,239
It was good for its time like when the Backstreet Boys were catchy but not too annoying

303
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,311
Md5 was fast but not too far

304
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,151
With the computing power available today however

305
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,199
It's far too quick to crack

306
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,759
Even the regular laptop can do the job

307
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:20,575
By the time of Ashley Madison hack

308
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
Md5 wasn't just

309
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Broken

310
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Broken Shredder

311
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
And talked into can't

312
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:30,559
Like busting out some New Kids on the Block on Spotify

313
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
You could say it's better than nothing

314
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,167
But that's about all you can say for it

315
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,519
Md5 is weak by today's standards in fact

316
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,591
That even you or I could possibly break it

317
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,127
Pier

318
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
Let's say the data I'm going to hash

319
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
Is a string podcast

320
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Let me

321
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,183
I'm going to a website online that auto generate an md5 hash for the password

322
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
In all lowercase

323
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Got it

324
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
Okay here's my hat

325
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
It's a C9

326
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,655
CEF

327
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,727
What is goes on for 27 more characters

328
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
But I'll spare you the rest of it

329
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
Sounds complicated

330
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Right

331
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,871
Kind of like nonsense

332
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,455
But remember what you just learned about hashing

333
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:24,575
Each character in that hashtag is directly drawn from the data I put in

334
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
In this case

335
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
The stream podcast

336
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
If my string work podcast

337
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,791
Would it be the hash would be entirely different

338
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,839
Not just randomly differ

339
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
But specifically different

340
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,399
To reflect

341
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Batman stream

342
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,959
You may think

343
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,263
How in the world would I be able to

344
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,383
Crack this hash function if I didn't already know the data is represented

345
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:49,919
Try this

346
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
I'm now on google.com

347
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,367
I'm going to copy and paste my hash into the search bar and

348
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
What

349
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,951
Free or the first for search results

350
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
Weed podcasts

351
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,047
Podcast names and nicknames for podcast

352
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
End podcast

353
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
That's not a coincidence

354
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,799
Simply by doing a Google search I was able to reverse-engineer this hash result to reveal the string

355
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,591
What's supposed to be obfuscating

356
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,711
Now do you see white how broken md5 is

357
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,295
Google won't work for every md5 hash

358
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Especially

359
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
Passwords more complex than

360
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,623
Podcast

361
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:34,207
But it's telling that at least and a certain parameters

362
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
Cracking an md5 hash

363
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
It's only the same amount of effort as say

364
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
Finding out how old I am

365
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
PNC by the way

366
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
H2O

367
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:50,335
Cynosure was able to review 11 million passwords in the first 10 days work

368
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
And the other four million shortly thereafter

369
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,247
Over 40% of the passwords from the site

370
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,063
My explaining the md5 hash

371
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Tokens

372
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:05,183
Cynosure also posted some of their favorite passwords

373
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:08,767
Which range from dumb to dirty to just

374
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
Sap

375
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
Sad by the folks who chose

376
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,399
I Think I Love My Wife

377
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,799
Why are you doing this and cheaters never Prosper to entering every time The Exorcist

378
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,639
Then there were those who are more introspective

379
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Like

380
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
Just checking it out

381
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,759
And good guy doing the wrong thing

382
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:33,599
Those who are catching into the whole Ashley Madison scam

383
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
Like nobody here and

384
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
They were robots

385
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,791
And those who thought they were clever like my password is password

386
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,839
The best password ever

387
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
And this is a good passer

388
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:52,287
Now back to the week of July 28th 2000

389
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
15

390
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:57,407
With no leads on who their attacker might be

391
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:00,223
The only question left for Alm to ask

392
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,807
Was who might have wanted to do harm to that company

393
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
That's of course

394
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,135
Is harder to answer

395
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,927
When you're talking about the website

396
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,255
Promoting and facilitating marital infidelity

397
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,815
As I mentioned earlier

398
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,119
Some thought the hacker or hackers

399
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,703
Might have been a disgruntled employee

400
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,263
Someone with close ties to the company

401
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,079
How else would they have known so much

402
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,383
About eight limbs internal systems

403
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,199
You might be interested to learn.

404
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,015
Pay Atlanta employees on the whole

405
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,343
Seem to have a pretty good life at the company

406
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,695
For all the sleeves and a morality of the service

407
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,535
You think their office headquarters would be filled with

408
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,839
Bad Dudes being inappropriate

409
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
And coming up with

410
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Evil plan

411
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Actually

412
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
It was quite the opposite

413
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,775
Employees who are paid handsomely

414
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
And there was

415
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
Free beer at the office

416
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
The financial post

417
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,199
The business-oriented paper-based in Canada

418
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:09,599
Spoke with the number of former employees describe the office is quote a fun place.

419
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,647
Get scared about its employees

420
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,511
There was a course another side to working at Alm

421
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:22,143
Those who spoke with the financial post had to do so anonymously because

422
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,935
To work for a

423
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,751
Requires signing a non-disclosure agreement

424
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
Lasting

425
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
Long past your death

426
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,103
Those who did speak

427
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:36,479
Cami and blatantly manipula

428
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
They described

429
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
Calls from anguished

430
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:44,671
Family members name the blame on Ashley Madison for ruining their families

431
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:48,767
Even threatening the lives of the customer service representative

432
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:49,791
And their families

433
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,887
It appears all Ashley Madison employees

434
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,447
Lived with this lingering dichotomy

435
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:01,567
Of their daily lives and underlined dirty thing they were helping to make

436
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:07,967
Still anyone working for Alm would have known what they signed up for from day one

437
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,807
If it were a former employee who hacked the site

438
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,623
What reason would they have for doing so

439
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:19,488
If it were a disgruntled customer or family member of a customer

440
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,024
How could they have such

441
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,096
Deep knowledge of idiot Lambs computer systems

442
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,680
Necessary to accomplish so successful the heck

443
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
The impact

444
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,032
Steam spice how careful they were

445
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:36,384
Dude leaves small Clues to their identity in their Manifesto

446
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:42,272
Among their issues with the lewd and immoral nature of Ashley medicine service

447
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,344
Fraud deceit and stupidity

448
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
Alm and their members

449
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,768
The hacker or hackers also took issue with one particular feature of the website

450
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,864
Ashley Madison offers a full delete feature

451
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,008
What about users can shut down there counting wipe all trace of it from Alm database

452
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,336
Payment of 19.99 dollars

453
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,152
Because of the nature and flea medicine

454
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,200
The future is invaluable

455
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
The impacting pointed out that they were able to find data on all users in the site's history

456
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,136
Including

457
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,440
Those who paid for full delete

458
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,512
The delete function was turned out

459
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,280

461
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
Why beads impact

462
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,216
Team care so much about this fool delete front

463
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:40,128
Is the hacker was some vengeful wife of an Ashley Madison user why would she give it any mind

464
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,248
It seems like the sort of thing a former account holder my care about

465
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
Oh maybe an employee

466
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,832
The Mayfest though it seems

467
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,880

00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
And then

470
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,512
Who was one more mystery left on soul

471
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
When Brian crafts

00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,424

508
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888

The best decision I had ever made

512
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,456
Then I simply turned up in Canada

513
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Live there for a year

514
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:55,552

516
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
And then

517
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,184
I simply disappeared

518
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,816

With a few interesting tidbits of information

529
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,376
They revealed that Alm actually first became aware of the hack on July 12th

530

You might notice another tab open in zoos browsers

563
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
The YouTube video

564
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
AC DC

565
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,208
Sandusky

566
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
The show eventually

567
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
Was about to start

568
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
In later posts

569
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,424
Zoo denied being the perpetrator of the airline

570
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,728
His role in the events

571
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,800
His true identity remains unknown

572
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
To this day

573
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
In fact

574
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,896
Even weeks after the initial attack

575
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:32,992
Neither Alm they're hired security no Canadian police

576
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,784
Could find the culprit

577
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:38,112
You could call this a huge failure

578
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:43,232
Oh you could point to all the evidence that the impact team meant business

579
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,328
That they breached every corner of Alm service

580
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,424
Did they were willing to release the most sensitive data online

581
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,008
And that they did it all without leaving a trace behind

582
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,824
Perhaps aoins biggest failure

583
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,384
Was under estimating their opponent

584
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
Both Ashley Madison and

585
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,968
Established men

586
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,832
Stayed online essentially golding's it impacts team to do their worst

587
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
In the end

588
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:18,048
What happened when the impact team release the 60

589
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,328
Gigabyte data dump

590
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,632
Stolen from Airlines database

591
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,960
That'll be the topic of our next episode

592
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:29,568
The second and last installment of the Ashley Madison hack series

593
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,224
Will explore the fall out of the hack and how it was used to Blackmail isn't even unrelated peep

594
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,272
Including one of our cats

595
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:43,904
We also talked about the inner workings of Ashley Madison and how Bots were you

596
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,672
To do

597
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
Clueless customers

598
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
All this and more

599
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
