1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Eagle one package being delivered

2
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,184
$300

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,048
Two Bounty Hunter moments later you got sent a Google Maps screenshot

4
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
The Bounty Hunter

5
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:41,216
It's on the current location of the phone that Joseph asked him to track no hacking required

6
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:47,616
A report from website motherboard revealed T-Mobile and other cell providers sold data to third parties resulting in

7
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
Information sharing location

8
00:00:54,272 --> 00:01:00,416
Motherboard investigation into the Shady unauthorized sale of cell phone location tracking data shows the terrifying

9
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
Ways which are personal data is sold and mishandled first by telecom companies like chemo

10
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:13,216
Mobile Sprint and AT&T and then by series of increasingly obscure middlemen and data aggregator

11
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,616
The companies have names like Amigo and micro belt you probably never heard of them

12
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
Adeno

13
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
Where you are this week

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,760
We're taking a deep dive into that world first

15
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,088
Motherboard editor-in-chief Jason Kepler will talk to Joseph

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,136
Investigation

17
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
About how bounty hunters

18
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Antique collectors

19
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,608
Skirt the law then I'll talk to Oregon Senator Ron Wyden about the Fallout from the story

20
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,680
In about his quest to keep your private data

21
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,240
Private Roku

22
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
Decipher

23
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:56,736
So Joseph earlier this month we published an investigation that you've been working on

24
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,272
For quite some time

25
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
In the peace

26
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,368
You bought location data from

27
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
From someone that we had

28
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,696
Consent to track

29
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
From a bounty hunter

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,512
CareSource

31
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
Where did that information

32
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Can come from

33
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
Yeah so this wasn't a hacking tool

34
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,448
Spying device

35
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,496
It was actually base of the cane

36
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,544
Enough from the Telco itself

37
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592
In this case T-Mobile

38
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,712
Is constantly communicating with other networks

39
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,576
So tmobile AT&T or Sprint

40
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,136
Can you send text messages and

41
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
And they sell it for a profit

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,768
Adams a trickle-down

43
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,536
Companies

44
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
Turtle Beaches

45
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,960
Right so did you I saw some people staying after we reported

46
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
That you bought this on the dark web I think one of the companies said that we did not find this on a dark web this is not

47
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,920
Dark web service as far as We Know

48
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,992
Yeah this is an adult website as in it's not say

49
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,344
Cool website like alphabay where you can buy drugs so bad

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,416
So whatever else that selling out

51
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
Word of Mouth Network bouncy house

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,328
Capability

53
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,400
Because so many different Industries in companies have access to the states

54
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,192
Roadside assistance

55
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,472
Car rental

56
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,544
Eva Peron e Property tenants who wants to background check

57
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,336
Oh maybe you renting the

58
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,360
Quotation

59
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
And clearly some of the most a reseller

60
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,344
Write a big one and I think we can get into this later is bounty hunters

61
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
And debt collectors

62
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,208
And so-called skip tracers which I guess is an industry

63
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
Term for essentially bounty hunting

64
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
And finding people

65
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584
Who have skipped bail or have

66
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
You know someone some money

67
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
You know these are being

68
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,704
Sold

69
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,496
Two private parties

70
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,568
Buy data aggregators who get it from

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Telecom

72
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Companies Direct

73
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,920
And this is a pretty big business

74
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,480
This is not just

75
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Being used

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,272
4

77
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
Services that are good for

78
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,368
The world

79
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:18,047
I need the two main question quote legitimate use cases of the states would be roadside assistance

80
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,351
So that's why you broken down somewhere

81
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,959
The insurance company is going to come through

82
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,263
I was trying to locate

83
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,335
Another

84
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,895
Family Financial

85
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,711
So you do a online transaction

86
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
And the company wants to check the

87
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,551
Is this person actually in

88
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,439
Same country weather claiming to be maybe the arcade dress matches and so notation notches on

89
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
So they should be on the way

90
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,047
YouTube

91
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
Chris hiestand

92
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
I'm use cases but haven't yet

93
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,167
Bounty hunters

94
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
Bail bondsman in

95
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
Street

96
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,079
Even though

97
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,759
Industry I was still able to hold it

98
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
Let's talk a little bit about how this

99
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,599
Actually went down

100
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,439
I remember when we were actually doing it we were sort of like

101
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,511
You know they can do the Ping at anytime and

102
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
We can get

103
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,607
Live real-time location of that phone

104
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
Basically insta

105
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:26,911
So

106
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,983
How did it work from your end as much as you're able to

107
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Yasso

108
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,871
I have to contact my source and then he was buying

109
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
The

110
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:37,919
Location

111
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
I'm paying for his own soul

112
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
This is quite complicated

113
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,575
Trickle-down

114
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,207
Tell my source hey please go to that I get from a phone number

115
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,999
He passes on to his source

116
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
Do that and he's the one who actually has

117
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
Today's Rock

118
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,863
Into

119
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
The system

120
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,447
Location

121
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,007
Originally we tried this with a Verizon

122
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
Verizon will not speak to me they will speak to other Publications but for some reason they don't reply to my request to come in

123
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
It seems.

124
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,015
Do bounty hunters do not want to geo-locate

125
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,039
Verizon phones

126
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,207
Verizon will send a text message to the phone

127
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
On Wednesday located

128
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,351
You don't really want

129
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
Because it's going to be

130
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,423
Tipping off the target

131
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
And instead we provide to the T-Mobile

132
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,031
Am I sore

133
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Saturday

134
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,895
The capability to work on tmobile AT&T or Sprint

135
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
Companies admitted they were selling the station this way

136
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,783
T-Mobile was the one that we successfully located

137
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
Case number

138
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,647
Mysore and incense

139
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Just look like a Google Maps

140
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
Interface

141
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
Little talks on the map

142
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,095
Add a circle indicating Route 500

143
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,143
Of where this particular phone was

144
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,191
Interspecific parmesan Queens

145
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,775
So it's really easy to understand this

146
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
I'll choose

147
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
Language is it literally just

148
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
That's why the person is

149
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
And the reason that this works

150
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,487
Is it's not hacking your phone it's not using the GPS coordinates from your phone it's using the

151
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
Cell towers that your phone is

152
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
Connected to

153
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Which is why that data is able

154
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
Come from

155
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,375
Providers

156
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,143
I just want to be

157
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
Be clear about that

158
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,751
This is a very similar thing that happened

159
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Or was uncovered

160
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Few months

161
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,639
To go by the New York Times and Senator Ron Wyden who

162
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
Ben is going to be talking to you later in this

163
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
Episode

164
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
I disappear

165
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Securus

166
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,575
Company can you just explain what

167
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Securus was

168
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,903
Yasso

169
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
Navigation with a bouncy house

170
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
Effects of a company called micro builds

171
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,023
I'm in the New York Times

172
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
Mastication

173
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:06,911
In that same positive supply chain

174
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,727
The company is selling it to the end client

175
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
They focus on one quotes Akira

176
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,591
Prosecutors who selling it to law enforcement

177
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
You did not require a warrant

178
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
So prison officials

179
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,343
They found documented cases using MS Access

180
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,903
To try cover official rules on even judges

181
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,743
Patelco stock

182
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
To that company

183
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:39,167
And then of course several months later we find that

184
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,495
Even doing it in arguably even worse used

185
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,823
Which is not even lower. A private business

186
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:50,175
So I do want to talk about why this is so concerning because

187
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,199
Like you mentioned

188
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
Yes there are legitimate uses

189
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,527
For this but

190
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:55,295
A lot of

191
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,623
The companies that are ultimately buying this

192
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
Data Arabic Shady

193
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,695
And so I wanted to

194
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Track it from

195
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,327
The Telecom company down to you let's just make that very clear

196
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
How did

197
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
You get this information

198
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:14,495
Like T-Mobile what was the next company what was the next company and what to do companies

199
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
Do

200
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:20,639
6

201
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
It starts with

202
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
T-Mobile

203
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,711
Patelco

204
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
Adam goes down to

205
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,551
Suncoast location aggregator

206
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
Does two of these one chords

207
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
Locationsmart

208
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,743
These are the ones just directly underneath

209
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Dave and salad

210
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
To an unknown number of company

211
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
Buy micro belt fits in

212
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,423
Is my Securus

213
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
Fitzsimmons well

214
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,543
Busy number

215
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
End user client

216
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
This was a bounty hunter company

217
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,967
The question quote legitimate

218
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,247
Trade

219
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,087
Because then they were just use that they said that they shouldn't still pains

220
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,623
But it's also where the black market

221
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,439
So

222
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,767
Sold out dates for access to a source of mine

223
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,399
It's a very long convoluted supply chain of dosa

224
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
V u get away from it

225
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
From the top

226
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,007
Patelco

227
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,823
Clearly had no idea just out of date was being used

228
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
Until we talk

229
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,127
Right and

230
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
The further away you get I think that this is

231
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,247
Does editorializing a little bit but the further away you get the less

232
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
Send less legitimate

233
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,295
Cats

234
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:36,671
These companies are a bit Shady we looked into some of them

235
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,255
Some of their just social media presence has and their YouTube presence is

236
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,655
And this is us amigo CEO chirag bakshi a few years ago talking about

237
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,191
Why you sounded to come

238
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,751
Zumigo has birthday unique solution

239
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,543
That leverages

240
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
The power of mobile data

241
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
Including location

242
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,919
Salsa industry

243
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
Challenges

244
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,015
You will see a solution for

245
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,295
Transaction validation

246
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
Device Authentication

247
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Nky

248
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
Sbi know your customer

249
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
But I'd be remiss

250
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,255
If I didn't mention the power of a location

251
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Data

252
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:13,791
For marketing

253
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,071
Are you nice

254
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
Patent pending technology

255
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
Makes up the only solution

256
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
That can locate a phone

257
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
Anywhere globally

258
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
No matter what no matter where

259
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,359
Using a GPS simulator or Wi-Fi router

260
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Easy

261
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
Where the mobile phone thinks it is

262
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,039
But not when you do it from the net

263
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
So

264
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Chirag In that clip says that

265
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
D'Amico

266
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,535
Uses location data for the purposes of fraud prevention and in Sumter

267
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,559
Cases marketing

268
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,423
We don't know which company zumigo ultimately sells to but we do know that micro built

269
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Is one of them

270
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,495
And micro belt is

271
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,823
A credit reporting agency I guess

272
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
Is how they build themselves

273
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
But they are also

274
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,431
A company that sells

275
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Databases

276
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
People to

277
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Bail bondsman

278
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,575
And used car salesman and landlords

279
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,391
And do you remember the name of the

280
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Specific

281
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
Tool that they they have

282
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:16,511
Yeah so this one was cool with a mobile device

283
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
Verify

284
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
And that's the

285
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Location

286
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
Right so

287
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:28,543
Is you check out micro builds YouTube they advertise to

288
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,847
Bail bondsman and two so-called

289
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
Skip tracers

290
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Switches

291
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
Bounty Hunter

292
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,479
Here is one of

293
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,551
Here's an ad that they put on their YouTube for one of their products

294
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
Address nonexistent

295
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:05,407
Because now there's a way to know everything

296
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,807
What did it take to expose

297
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,599
Master of Deceit and deception

298
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
A 25-cent surf report

299
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
Microbilt enhanced people search

300
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
It keeps you one step ahead of anyone

301
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,791
From accidental skip

302
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:27,167
Do professional debtors it's the world's most advanced database for collectors

303
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
Now it's updated with all new data sources

304
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,567
Including information that is reported directly to microvilli

305
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,871
And aggregated oleate micro belt

306
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,247
Michael Bilton ants people search

307
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,831
And then I just want to be clear

308
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,879
Last year they had

309
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,951
An audio webinar where they talk to

310
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,303
Two people in the quote-unquote asset management and Recovery industry

311
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
And this is where things get

312
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,143
Pretty shady and in my opinion

313
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,471
These are the debt collectors and the bounty hunters

314
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
And

315
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,567
One of these webinars which was sponsored by micro built

316
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
Was called

317
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,663
What you can and can't do when skip tracing

318
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
How do you start a know when you're being

319
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:16,063
When you're short of getting to the line of being deceptive or maybe when you

320
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Cross the line

321
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Wait wait

322
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Treinar tracer

323
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,767
So many times when you're talkin to third parties you'll be asked a question like will

324
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
Is this about a bill is this about a debt

325
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Do they owe you money

326
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Who do you work

327
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:31,935
And you know if

328
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,519
Utila people I'm sorry but under Federal I can't give you that information or

329
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
I'm not going to give you that info

330
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
Obviously you're not going to get anything out of them at all

331
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,991
Two braid man spear linguistic technique there when someone says it is

332
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Are you calling about a bill

333
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
We repeat

334
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,855
The question are you calling about a

335
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,623
Bill

336
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,671
And then we would say something like

337
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,439
That's a very

338
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,535
Strange or unusual nobody wants to be a stranger.

339
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
Strange question

340
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Why would you ask me

341
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
That

342
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
And they will reply back

343
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,471
You know we don't have to answer

344
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Question

345
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
What we're taught

346
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,567
The time we were in grade school that we do

347
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,151
They will answer that question will I know that he lost

348
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
Job and excetera

349
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,247
I know they moved I know they're having trouble I know somebody

350
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,111
And then you reply with with another mural District word

351
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
Really

352
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
End the conversation moves on

353
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
You never had to

354
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
To answer their question

355
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
Gave you actually gained information

356
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
Without giving them anything

357
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,143
So consequently

358
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,215
That is a good technique to train your collect

359
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,287
And then they're not going to be breaking while they're not going to be saying things that they

360
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
They shouldn't say

361
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
That's one way that we do

362
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,431
You have gone right to the line and we talked about stepping over the line

363
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,991
But you you haven't broken the law

364
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,111
But let me tell you have gone right to the very precipice and looked over his

365
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,695
But you haven't broken the law

366
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
Be careful and again you only very

367
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Experience collect

368
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
Can use techniques like that only very stupid

369
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,887
French dip tray

370
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:09,215
What you just heard was Ron Brown he is the

371
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,031
The president of CSI Group which is an Oklahoma

372
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
City Base

373
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
Asset management and

374
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Recovery company

375
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:18,943
He also runs a website called Manhunt seminars

376
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
And he's very into

377
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Saying that he

378
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,063
Is company hunts The Most Dangerous Game

379
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Game which is

380
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Humans

381
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:29,695
It's kind of like it's is really wild

382
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,743
And on this webinar

383
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
She talks about the

384
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,327
The fair debt collection practices Act

385
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,631
Which is a law passed by the US government

386
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
That's basically set

387
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,007
The rules for what debt collectors and bounty hunters

388
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:43,775
Can ask

389
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,311
Friends of

390
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,591
The person that they're trying to

391
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Define without

392
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,895
Breaking the law

393
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
He talks about going right up to this

394
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,479
This end of the line

395
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,271
Many talks about

396
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,599
Neuro linguistic techniques and manipulation

397
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
To get

398
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
Information that he can then use to f

399
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Actually locate the person

400
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
And

401
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
From these webinars it was very clear that

402
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
People are using these

403
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Tools

404
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
It's not just

405
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,655
You know the old fashioned social media

406
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
Searches and calling up

407
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
You know friends and relatives

408
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,311
They are buying data from these data brokers

409
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,615
They are using companies like microbuild

410
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
Which use companies like zumigo

411
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,479
Which get data from the telecom companies so

412
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:28,319
Yeah this all does trickle down in a pretty scary way

413
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
And in a way that

414
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,951
Yeah might be technically legal I think at one point he mentioned

415
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
You know a lot of bounty hunters or X

416
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,303
C using more third-party

417
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
Data brokers

418
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
Because

419
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,167
The fair debt collection practices Act

420
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
Doesn't actually cover

421
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,519
Weasel waterfall technique

422
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
When were skip tracing

423
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,127
And obviously with with agencies today and the dip

424
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Rage

425
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
We'll start out

426
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,735
With what we've turned free site

427
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
And we can't find them on the social sites

428
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Supreme sizing

429
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,623
Thing with drop-down

430
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
Odoo the page lights

431
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
The difference

432
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:06,975
Data Brokers that are gathering up the data Fortune

433
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Can we pay for that

434
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
But

435
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
You don't we

436
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Trackpad

437
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
The cost of it verse

438
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
Is the recovery

439
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
3 percentage

440
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,447
And it was like a waterfall you gather at Summit

441
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Each weather

442
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,359
So there are these quote-unquote legitimate uses of this data at least technically legal uses at the moment

443
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
Which do include

444
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,175
You know the things like

445
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Ron brownlees

446
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Talking about

447
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:31,807
But once you even go a step further where

448
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,623
Just anyone can buy location tracking data

449
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,671
Why is this such a threat why is it so

450
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,439
So scary

451
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:42,303
Yeah spread sound from the original Source Pimentel toes

452
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
The risk of abuse

453
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
Just dramatically increases

454
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,959
Bounty hunters

455
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,287
Individuals may just spawn a girlfriend

456
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
I just was told me is what happened

457
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Among these people

458
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,431
One citizen has access to that data

459
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,735
8 time it appears do whatever they want

460
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,527
Because Microtel

461
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,111
Amigo the Telco companies they only found out about this abuse

462
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
When we told them

463
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
Cadence

464
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
In the first

465
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:14,047
Staley found out about 2

466
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,119
Up to this point

467
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
We have no idea

468
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,823
I feel like I mean maybe it would be very

469
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:26,591
Suspicious

470
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,687
Someone with locating 10005 in a day or something like that

471
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
Is it based on a trust model

472
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:40,159
You've told them that again uses for the sheets but she doesn't worry all the way.

473
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
Tencent

474
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,719
Play leader Consent means nothing

475
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
The promise

476
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,607
Because we were just about anyway and find a phone

477
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,727
Right before we publish the story We reached out to zumigo and

478
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,495
Micro build

479
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
Who both sad

480
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
Yeah we don't tolerate a

481
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,615
Abuse in our system but

482
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,639
Could you leave a worm

483
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
Looking for it.

484
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Closely

485
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,503
There's a difference between

486
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
Tolerating abuse

487
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
And actually enforcing against

488
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,135
I'm clearly they weren't really doing

489
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
I like how you look

490
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
The Bounty Hunter bail bondsman

491
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:23,935
Estates of the middleman say they said they were going to use it for the adjustment that person they have a lots of money

492
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
Coming in from

493
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
From the Bounty Hunter

494
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,335
They would kind of feel like pushing response

495
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
You can't just go on the Promises

496
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
If you're inclined

497
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Like

498
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
Datetime to technical measures

499
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,087
Such as always pushing a text message to the phone

500
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,135
Maybe oversee

501
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Some

502
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,255
Legal

503
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
Clearly something is working

504
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,375
And it seems that Elko is known as well because they smell

505
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,727
Brighten one one other thing I heard during the webinar

506
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,519
Webinars that I listen to

507
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,567
Are is the fact that

508
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,127
It's very important to these companies that

509
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
This I'll be invisible

510
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,735
That they don't want to alert the person that they're looking

511
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
For that they are looking

512
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,575
So you know they were talking about

513
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,111
You know if you are

514
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
Using Facebook

515
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,184
Define someone make sure you don't friend them

516
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,744
Do quote-unquote read only on Facebook

517
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
And

518
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,120
And it's interesting you mention the telcos cuz they're obviously very

519
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,936
Involved here they're very

520
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:32,032
It's ultimately they're making money off of this data and it

521
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
It's something that they

522
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,128
Should be ultimately responsible for because that is

523
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,200
Sort of who you're originally giving the data to

524
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,760
Or it's or unwittingly giving it to

525
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,344
But it's interesting they are actually involved in this in a

526
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Different way to

527
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
And we don't necessarily I don't know this

528
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
Civics of how this works

529
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,328
But one of the people on the webinar his name is Ralph Lesinski who's

530
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,632
Is the senior Vice President of Finance

531
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
Diversity

532
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
Diversified

533
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Consultants

534
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
Mention.

535
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,568
The telecom companies are actually one of his biggest

536
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
Clients in terms of

537
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Finding

538
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
These people

539
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
Collect debts for

540
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,224
So for example

541
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,016
You're more than half of our

542
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,296
A business

543
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,088
Lies in the Telecom

544
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Field

545
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Sanya collecting

546
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
First cell phone

547
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,952
Yelp

548
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
Skip trace phone number

549
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,120
Become the light blood

550
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,824
Because we found a

551
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,408
Exclusivity contract

552
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
Data sources

553
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,504
And being that were so heavily

554
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,808
That is the NFL

555
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,856
Telekom Arena

556
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
Im4us

557
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
Each count upon placement

558
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
Because we're looking for

559
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,888
Cell phone number that that consumer in essentially

560
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
No longer has

561
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,752
Not only are they giving the data out

562
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
They rely on bouncy house

563
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,568
Counters to find

564
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,872
People who are not paying their bills to the toilet

565
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,640
Companies

566
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
Vicious cycle is there

567
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
Benefits

568
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,256
Ryan this is necessarily from the cell phone location data because

569
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
They actually have that

570
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,328
But companies like microbuild

571
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,888
Have other databases and you know

572
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,168
Build out webs of

573
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,448
Information about

574
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
Who else you are connected

575
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
2 and stuff like that

576
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,592
On this specific use case that rap was talking about

577
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Was

578
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,664
I people who

579
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Get a

580
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,296
Subsidy to buy their phone or lease their phone from a cell phone provider

581
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,600
And then they just like turn it off and do

582
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,624
Disappear off the map

583
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,416
Maybe they sell the song maybe it's just

584
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,440
Secures

585
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,208
And

586
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,768
Technically

587
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
We still on that phone so then they are

588
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
Looking to get a back or looking

589
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888

275 students

593
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,152
But it is still

594
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:22,528
Uncomfortable Alliance that were there also providing at least some cases

595
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,880
The dates of these companies May then also going on sale

596
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Right right

597
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:32,768
I want to end here by talking about what the Fallout from this has been

598
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,560
This is obviously a huge story when he

599
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
Published it

600
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376

602
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
I think

603
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:44,032
Tucker Carlson wanted Yuan I died you didn't do it

604
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,592
But you know

605
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,712
Besides this wasn't a big deal and it's gotten a lot of attention and

606
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
Some actual changes

607
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,064
Yeah so sounds from Leiden

608
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,112
Was quoted in the original story

609
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,464
Please contact him because he has two states

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,048
Sphinx

611
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,352
Legislation would be a good idea here

612
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,216
Hey this is one of the Avenues

613
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008
The lawmakers are exploring

614
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800

00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,152
Other Sciences join the SEC

617
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
To investigate

618
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
We then had

619
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
Congressional committees

620
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,808

Define to do that during the ongoing government shutdown

626
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,376
We'll see if when the government comes by if the government comes back

627
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
Fingers crossed

Ambulette service in the growing pressure on them

Yes I'm in the school

634
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,272
Is the political realm the telcos AT&T

635
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,808
T-Mobile and Sprint

636
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,880
Access to microdose

637
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:08,256
They also said they're going to stop the sale of location dates

638
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
Two fatalities Odessa

639
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
In general

640
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
Include

641
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,912
The roadside assistance

642
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,496
Play this is such a liability

643
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:22,080
Even when the trying to go to The Limited use cases

644
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,176
Juniata hands and into other people's exercise control

645
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,200
So

646
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,528
I maybe you can send

647
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,832
A legislation perspective eventually it

648
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
Probably makes no sense

649
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
It companies Austin Tyler

650
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,976
Right and I will need to get super into it but

651
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,560
I can think of other ways of doing roadside

652
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Assistant

653
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
Besides cell phone tower

654
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:48,448
I mean there apps for this where you connect

655
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
Play give them your GPS

656
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,032
Data in and stuff like that knowing

657
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Yeah yeah if you will

658
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:58,432
I'm with an American Insurance company or American Roadside Assistance companies

659
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,248
Resume

660
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
Cuz it just seems so obvious

661
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:08,416
But you can download an app and then hey I can't type my location track please could you come find me

662
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:20,448
Sending the phone's GPS locations and

663
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Crucially is doing it with concern

664
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,336
The user is pushing the button to say hey I would like to be located

665
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
The fundamental

666
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:35,040
The dates are the unused cases

667
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
Legislation

668
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
Savannah Technical measures

669
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
It's going to rest on

670
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,464
Consent

671
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
So I'm gonna throw it back now

672
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,120
To ban who is going to talk to Senator Ron Wyden about

673
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,936
Cell phone location tracking his privacy bill

674
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,240
He's been very anti-surveillance

675
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,800
You know one of the most outspoken

676
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
Senators on this

677
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
Tissue over the last

678
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:01,408
Decade or so so

679
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,968
I hear is Ben and Senator Ron Wyden

680
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,296
What was your reaction

681
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
The story that Joseph

682
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Butt out last week

683
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
First of all I was just

684
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,928
Just thrilled

685
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Joe Cocker

686
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,256
Ran that piece because

687
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,304
It really allowed us

688
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
The bus

689
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
Open again

690
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,472
This issue where we thought the wireless carriers were dragging their feet in for

691
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,800
People were following this let me just kind of give

692
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,384
Quick historical summary we essentially

693
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,408
Caught

694
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,200
Through this

695
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
Prison

696
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,832
Information sharing operation in 2018

697
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,368
Set the wireless

698
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,672
Carrier

699
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:48,512
Monopoly a real sweetheart you know arrangement

700
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,328
For making it possible

701
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,984
Offer what I call the Bottom Feeders of in of the internet that people wear

702
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:02,592
Data Brokers buying location information from all kinds of

703
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,408
Shady operation

704
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
When we caught it

705
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,552
All of the carrier sent me letters in 2018

706
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,088
Thing we're going to

707
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Stop that

708
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
.

709
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
.

710
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,184
Renee understood

711
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,720
Point that

712
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
Williams

713
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Good Folk

714
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
Set motherboard in Vice City

715
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,608
I'm making that is

716
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,472
No location tracking is a national security in a personal

717
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
Safety nightmare

718
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,312
So we catch him in 2018

719
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,616
They claim that they're going to stop

720
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,408
Not a whole lot of qualifiers

721
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
Say we're going to stop

722
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,528
And then we had the Joe Cocker

723
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:47,904
All the good Folks at. At motherboard basically get a bounty hunter

724
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,232
I'll give him a couple hundred bucks and we saw that

725
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,584
At least three of the four major carriers that basically dead

726
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,144
American Consumer a bunch of baloney

727
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,936
And father was a republic service

728
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,056
Melamine that's the thing right this is a year-old this is this is not new

729
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,336
So what

730
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
What are you prepared to do as a senator

731
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
To stop this issue

732
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,528
To make sure that this doesn't happen that you don't get another letter where the carriers tell you

733
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
Oh

734
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,112
It's never going to happen again it's going to end right now

735
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
Blah blah blah because it has

736
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,536
And I want to pick up the discussion right there because that's the point

737
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,560
That I've

738
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,584
Been making

739
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
Is

740
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,704
Hey they made me promises to me in writing

741
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
In 2018

742
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:38,080
Now they're making these promises again

743
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
And so a lot of folks

744
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
Send the media and the like

745
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,480
If it's all wrong what do you think of that

746
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
Permit me to be a little bit

747
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,624
Skeptical I'll believe it when I actually see it

748
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,184
And there is a real pattern

749
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:56,256
Now in the technology

750
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,024
Space

751
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Where

752
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,328
Essentially

753
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,888
If companies get caught

754
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:04,192
Irresponsible conda

755
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
1

756
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,008
Too damn

757
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
Apologize

758
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
And three they pledge

759
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
It won't happen again

760
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
And then of course it does happen

761
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
Again you can almost

762
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,552
Set your clock by it I call it the

763
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,856
Wash rinse and repeat

764
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
Cycle

765
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,416
In the technology

766
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
Area

767
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:30,304
And so I want it understood one I'll believe it when I see it

768
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
And

769
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:35,424
You know people by John legere of already kind of change their story initially

770
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,984
She didn't say anything about how

771
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,800
In 2018 had to wait until March 29th

772
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Todd Sweeney

773
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
Beyonce now

774
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
We've got it in

775
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Bet it

776
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
In Black

777
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,760
Letter lot MF part of my privacy legislation

778
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,600
We have a provision that finally will have some real

779
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
Keith

780
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:58,720
So that when you catch him you don't just slap their wrist or wait for their next

781
00:31:58,976 --> 00:31:59,488
Promise

782
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,536
We should be followed by some

783
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,328
Pretty much meaningless gesture

784
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,144
We have a top provision we called do not

785
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,912
Crack

786
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
So that

787
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:11,264
People were following this this debate would have an option

788
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,056
Tarulli

789
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,384
Send signal signal in the marketplace

790
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
They don't meet rack

791
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,712
Now you know I understand that

792
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,808
Senator Kamala Harris is also me know she's outraged by the story as well

793
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:28,416
Do you see this is sort of a bipartisan issue as well it is their Republican support

794
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,440
For something like this

795
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,024
Well I hope so I saw today

796
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:37,888
Dead several Republican house members had sent a letter

797
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
Expressing concern

798
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,520
And frankly the Congress are good

799
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,568
Are expressing concern

800
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,152
The question is are you going to go beyond

801
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,688
Expressing concern

802
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,480
And be for tough

803
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,040
Enforceable legislation

804
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,600
That has real teeth for example

805
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:04,000
One provision of my draft privacy melon for people are following is debating go online wheel of their comment

806
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
Is

807
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
We want to send a

808
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
Signal

809
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:08,864
About how

810
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Serious

811
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
These

812
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,216
Privacy issues are as I say I think

813
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
Potentially

814
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
They are

815
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,640
National Security personal security nightmares in fact

816
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,992
Again when it comes to expressing concern the company's are pretty good

817
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:31,392
Sheryl Sandberg Jack Dorsey came to an open intelligence committee hearings we don't have very many of them so I always used

818
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,160
Dumbest kind of

819
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
Rare special opportunities

820
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
And I said Point Blank

821
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
I believe

822
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,816
Personal data

823
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,608
Personal privacy

824
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,656
Arnel Nationals

825
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
Security issues

826
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:48,288
I would like to ask you miss Sandberg representing Facebooking demister Dorsey

827
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,080
I would like to ask

828
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:55,200
You all feel point-blank do you believe personal privacy is a national

829
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Security issue

830
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,504
Both of them said yes

831
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,576
You just keep pushing the rock up the hill

832
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:04,160
And as part of our legislation

833
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,952
I want to make clear

834
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
That if the

835
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,256
CEO

836
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
At one of the countries

837
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
Company

838
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:15,680
Company with more than a billion dollars in Revenue

839
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:20,288
Lies to the federal government lies to the American

840
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:26,688
People and the agency that would be responsible in our bill for handling this is Federal Trade Commission if they lie

841
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,224
Why did the federal government

842
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,272
They would no longer

843
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,856
Just get a slap on the wrist big face serious Financial penalties

844
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,696
And face the possibility of jail

845
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,720
And

846
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:44,096
That is essentially what's done with respect to the big financial institutions in sarbanes-oxley

847
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
What I'm here

848
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,680
To say the people were following of this

849
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,520
Good enough for the big banks that are the good enough for the big technology companies

850
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,592
I mean winter describing is how

851
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,152
Somebody's big telcos lied to you last year

852
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,200
Because as Joe Cox Show

853
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
It was quite the opposite.

854
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,528
Discontinued

855
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,576
Not only

856
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
Did Jo Cox

857
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
Show it

858
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
Joe Cocker

859
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,232
Basically by giving a few hundred bucks

860
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,280
To the Bounty Hunter

861
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,120
These companies could get away with it

862
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,936
Essentially with impunity

863
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,776
You know they basically we're showing their disdain

864
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
4

865
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
Legislators

866
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,432
Regulators in others

867
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,224
And my guess is

868
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,528
Head motherboard

869
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
Not blown you know the whistle

870
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,904
My guess is that we probably would have found out yet

871
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,184
Some point

872
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,464
Somehow

873
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
Did they were basic

874
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
Leave

875
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,816
Reaching their pledges

876
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,888
Did they made to me in 2018

877
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
The reason it was

878
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,704
Search public service

879
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,496
Is that Joe Cox

880
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,336
Exposed it for a few hundred bucks

881
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,360
Made it

882
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,968
Clear the TV wireless you know carriers were just walking all over the pledges

883
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
They made

884
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:09,344
Me and effect United States Senator and the Senate

885
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
And

886
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:17,536
Most valuable part of the whole thing

887
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,864
The session of Congress their bills being discussed

888
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,144
And

889
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,216
And that's why I was glad the motherboard

890
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,800
Lookeba Hawkins issues for years movie looking back on

891
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:34,176
Snowden Revelations and we saw big telcos then being abusive with same types of things

892
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:38,272
I guess now you don't forgive me for being a little bit skeptical is

893
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:41,856
At what point are these companies going to be properly investigated

894
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
Answer to brought their feet

895
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
To the fire

896
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,976
Because this continues

897
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,536
Let me take you back

898
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,560
Little bit

899
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,840
Confirm history

900
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:57,216
You remember what happened on January 18th 2012 big day in Tech

901
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
No

902
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
More than

903
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
10

904
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,896
Million Americans

905
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,224
Texted tweeted

906
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
Call

907
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
Visited

908
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
There

909
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Senators

910
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
To say

911
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
Do not

912
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,488
Override Ron wyden's hold

913
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,792
Coming up in a few days

914
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,608
On a very flawed bill

915
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,680
That would do enormous damage to the internet

916
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,216
Bill for called tipping

917
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
SOPA

918
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
Basically with a

919
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:37,152
Rabble the architecture the internet was called the domain name system

920
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,224
And be built the pipa and sopa bill

921
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,248
And the fact

922
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
That we organize

923
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,832
So aggressive

924
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Stop

925
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,696
And we basically organized weekly meeting

926
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
Now with activist groups

927
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,280
The grass

928
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,304
Roots power

929
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,096
Of online

930
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
Activist

931
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,424
And if that time

932
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,520
More than 40 United States senators were co-sponsoring

933
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,568
Is beer very flawed Bell

934
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,152
And I kept telling the leadership of the Senate

935
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
Hey folks

936
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
I want to be stripper is here

937
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,808
But the reality is there are millions of Americans

938
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,112
Spend more time online in a week

939
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,696
Then they spend thinking about the United States senator in a year

940
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,744
When they find out

941
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,536
These bills

942
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,840
I'm going to do so much damage

943
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,912
Turn the internet they're not going to be happy and you're going to hear from them

944
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
And

945
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:37,824
The leadership basically told run the good guy knows about this text darphin

946
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,128
Can usually people say well

947
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,992
Keith from Oregon in a which always accompanies this story

948
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,040
And I would just say

949
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:51,648
I don't want to be difficult here but you are going to be pretty surprised

950
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,976
And on January 18th Wednesday

951
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,304
I'm more than 10 million Americans wait in

952
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
And on Friday

953
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,912
January 20th Harry Reid not very happy

954
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,704
Call me up said you won

955
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
Your bum hole is going to Prevail or not going to

956
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,592
Very flawed built would do so much damage

957
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
I'm to the internet

958
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
And so

959
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,712
That is kind of a textbook case

960
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,272
The activism that is possum

961
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,344
I will tell people following this debate

962
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
I don't think we're there yet

963
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,416
On privacy

964
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,208
We are not at that kind of

965
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
Flashpoint

966
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,072
We're in fact you'll be a nationwide

967
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,656
Mobilization and websites will go dark and all the things that we did

968
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:39,264
In the battle to defeat Pippa in the instapot

969
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,824
But I think we're getting there I think people

970
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:47,712
Are seeing that these mega-corporations are vacuuming up everything in sight

971
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
All the

972
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
Personal information and

973
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,648
Where you go and what you do and what you buy

974
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
Emma like

975
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,720
I'm not going to tell

976
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,000
Anybody falling

977
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,536
Discussion that we're there

978
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,584
In terms of tobacco

979
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,608
And sofa

980
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,936
Kind of mobilization but I think we're getting there

981
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
We're getting close

982
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,056
Especially when you look at something like

983
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:15,104
Sonny's key government positions

984
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,408
And I'm talking about the advertised of the world

985
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Who are

986
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,992

00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
