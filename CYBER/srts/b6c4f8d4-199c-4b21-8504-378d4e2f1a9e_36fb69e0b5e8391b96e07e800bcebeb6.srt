00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,592
2 minutes report revealed that may be much easier to hack into a personal cell phone than you might think so cocky

00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
The internet

9
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,504
The stuff gets complicated really fast

10
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,344
It's no wonder a lot of people don't know what it is or how it all works

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,184
We're going to break down a type of hacking

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:01,952
I could have fact

13
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,192
No this isn't Sony getting

14
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,240
Door somebody selling NSA hacking

15
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
It was talked about

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,568
Small-scale

17
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
This is about you

18
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,384
Phone

19
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
Imagine

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
She woke up

21
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200

22
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
And I'mma leave you alone

23
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,160
Why would you do something like this

24
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,768
Is that how we make money these days

25
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
Okay I don't have any Bitcoin

26
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,240
Granny Ripple or something

27
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
I don't have any Bitcoins

28
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
Whatever man whatever

29
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
Whatever floats your boat you know

30
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,672
Yeah

31
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,024
I don't even know how I would do that or why why are you doing this

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,120
This Guy Sebastian

33
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912

00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,240
Another voice on the phone

36
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,264
Guy getting hacked

37
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:20,800
Sentences

38
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,872
Something really unexpected happened

39
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,504
So for this story I want to talk to motherboard Lorenzo franceschi beat your eye

40
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
Superstar cyber security

41
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,392
About his report Joseph Cox's story

42
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
Bright solar wenzhou

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,816
This phone call freak me out

44
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,376
Yeah it would freak me out there

45
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,168
More importantly I was confused by it

46
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
How exactly did his work

47
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:49,728
Sam jacket

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,080
Custom jacking or also calcium swapping or Port out scam old

49
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
Turns out the same

50
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,688
Can jacking essential is when a hacker decides

51
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
To steal your phone number

52
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
For whatever reason

53
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:07,904
And the way they do it is that they call your cell phone provider that's a T-Mobile AT&T Verizon whatever

54
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,696
And they pretend to be you

55
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,512
So they call them and say hey I'm Ben

56
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,560
I need my phone number cuz

57
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,120
Maybe they invent some story that they lost her

58
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,912
Phone or whatever

59
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,472
And they need the phone number reactivated

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
Once they do that

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,592
What happens on your side as a victim is that you lose

62
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
Your phone service

63
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
So your phone becomes

64
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,736
Phone calls you cannot receive text messages

65
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
That's the only warning you receive

66
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,112
Sometimes you got a text message saying you know

67
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,904
Hey this is T-Mobile

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you for calling us we transfer your phone number and

69
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
You know usually

70
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,072
The way victims of disguises me

71
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
Is that they freaked out because I like

72
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
Wait a second I did not call T-Mobile

73
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,752
You know what is going on I cannot make calls my phone is bad

74
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
What's going on

75
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,360
And in the background what's happening is that doctors are

76
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
Using your phone number to reset all your account

77
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,248
Or to try to hack into old account they can

78
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,344
So I'm usually what they do go for first is your email

79
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:12,160
Because your email gives them the keys to

80
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,952
Other services

81
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,559
Think of your Banks probably of your bank accounts are registered to your email

82
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,399
If you have a cryptocurrency account it's probably registered to your email

83
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,959
Even though airplane miles

84
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,775
I probably I just hit you imagine all these things that are

85
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,823
Link to your email they can get into

86
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
At that point

87
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
So basically that call

88
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,687
Wow incredibly unsettling

89
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,223
It's when the heck is going portal

90
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
Yeah any fact

91
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,111
If you got that call is on his good news because then you have some amount of control

92
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,975
Because if everything goes according to plan which most of the time in Portia it does

93
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,327
You're not going to know what's going on oh you're going to see that your phone lost service

94
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,447
And you know you might not even be alarmed because maybe you're on a high can you like all well

95
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
There's no service here

96
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,775
But in the meantime some

97
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
19 year old

98
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
Idiot is

99
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
And I'll steal your money

100
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,687
So what exactly can you do

101
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
To protect yourself again

102
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,039
So here's the bad news

103
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
There's very little you can do

104
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
Unfortunately

105
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
And that's because

106
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
The hackers are attacking

107
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,559
Phone companies that are attacking you about through your telephone provider your cell phone provider

108
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
There's a few things you can do to not silver

109
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Bullets

110
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
Fun things you can do is at

111
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:35,359
The passcode to your cell phone account this is like separate from the password that you used to access like your online bills

112
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:42,015
It's only a password that will you will use when you call you know your T-Mobile your AT&T or whatever phone

113
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Provider you use

114
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,135
And that's going to be busy plea used to verify that it's really you

115
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,231
So the idea there is that if I'm trying to hack you and I'm trying to pretend

116
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,791
I'm you calling the phone company

117
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
I have to provide this

118
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Code

119
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,423
So that's a great idea that means you should work

120
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,567
Batting practice I heard the several stories of people that got hacked by a Sim tracking

121
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
And they

122
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,663
Had this cold and essentially the hackers just

123
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Went around it

124
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
So that's one thing the other thing is

125
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,575
Behind Siri two-factor authentication should be great because

126
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,903
You know it's not just your password is also the second code

127
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,975
I actually didn't hear the real twist

128
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,535
That surprised me when I started working on the story

129
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,607
Two-factor authentication in this case could actually hurt you

130
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
So

131
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,471
Two-factor authentication all that stuff that everyone is cyber community tells you to sort of the

132
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Bulletproof

133
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
Way of making sure you don't get hacked

134
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
That doesn't actually

135
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
Two-factor is good as long as you're not using your phone number

136
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
Because that's that's the key right

137
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,527
In the hackers get control of your phone number

138
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,575
Then they don't even need your password

139
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,415
Like it basically becomes one factor and they control it

140
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:58,303
Because the way to factor works most of the time is that once you give Alice a Google right

141
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
If you are using two-factor on Gmail

142
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:05,215
You give Google your phone number and that's not only used to deliver you know this

143
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
Codes that you use for logging in

144
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
It's also used for resetting your account

145
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,663
So let's say that one day you hit your head on the on the wall

146
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
And you forgot your password

147
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,807
You can go to Google and say hey I forgot my password and will Google will do is

148
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
And you a reset link on your phone

149
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,159
If I take control of your phone number

150
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,183
I don't even joke

151
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
So the way to make

152
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,119
Two-factor work in this case is to eliminate your phone number from all your accounts

153
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,191
Or use a phone number that's not

154
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,239
A real phone number as in

155
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,287
It's not a phone number provided by a company

156
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Like a telephone call

157
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,151
So you can use a Google Voice number a Skype number

158
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,991
Any other kind of voice over IP number cuz those numbers

159
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,807
Are not going to be as easy to hijack

160
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
As

161
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
Craigslist

162
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:55,135
Sweet walk me through it

163
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
If a hacker is trying to do this or assume Jacker

164
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:02,047
How do they come across getting the numbers just finding out the number is and then

165
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,375
And I'm getting information from the dark web like how do you get it

166
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,215
Yeah I think the best way to understand how these attacks work is just peanut run through it

167
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
Let's pretend that I'm a criminal

168
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
And I'm trying to hack you for whatever reason maybe I know that you have a lot of Bitcoin

169
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,151
So I choose to Target you

170
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,943
The next trick is to find out

171
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,967
Your phone number

172
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,623
Which in some cases is may be hard in some cases may not be very hard and I like white pages you could use White Pages you could use

173
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,463
I don't know any kind of other online

174
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Service like that

175
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:38,911
And once have your phone number I just need to figure out what provider you have which is also relatively easy I think you can just

176
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Google the number and

177
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263
A bunch of websites will tell you of the provider is

178
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
So that point

179
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:47,615
I'm calling your provider and I'm pretending to be you

180
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:54,271
And I'm saying hey I'm been I lost my phone I lost my SIM card whatever I use you know I can invent whatever story

181
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,343
He's got to be more credible essentially

182
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,695
At that point I tell you know the customer service

183
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
Specialist I tell them

184
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,815
I need you to transfer my number to the new SIM card they already bought

185
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
I have a new SIM card here

186
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
Avenue phone

187
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
I just need to

188
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,703
What they called portals

189
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
My old number to the new SIM card

190
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,591
This is what it depends on who you're talkin to what company you're talkin to

191
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,639
Etc button Siri they should

192
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,223
Try to verify that it's really you right cuz I'm not then I'm Lorenzo

193
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
So maybe they can ask me

194
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,831
Okay Ben what's your social security number

195
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:35,743
And then unfortunately that's in theory that should be secret but we know that it's not like Social Security numbers get so

196
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
Hold on the dark web

197
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,559
Correlative cheap

198
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,399
You know T-Mobile lost 50 million of them couple of years ago

199
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:49,055
Equifax lost $150 last year so it's like at this point we should probably consider Social Security numbers

200
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,639
In a semi-public with the last with questions like what was in a mirror

201
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,479
Pat Quinn x 40% X don't even ask for

202
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:02,879
After the number sometimes the question is what was your last home address which again in theory should be secret but

203
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,695
He's probably on some of his website like Wednesday

204
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,463
You can totally like

205
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
Type in somebody's name

206
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,119
Find addresses this is the real weakness in this whole pack like

207
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,655
Cell phone providers

208
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,935
Really not doing it

209
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
Anything to stop this

210
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,055
I mean that's a little unfair they are trying to stop this obviously

211
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Baidu

212
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
The way they verify your identity

213
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Through a phone call

214
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
Is totally

215
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Not enough

216
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:34,623
And that's where the criminals come in because all they need to do is essentially call up T-Mobile say I'm banned give me the number give me mine

217
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
A number which is not my number it's your number

218
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
And T-Mobile gives it to them

219
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Another point of game over

220
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
So what did the guy

221
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
In the phone call your source

222
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,143
What did he do with me no cyber

223
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,703
Security expert night imagine a lot of people aren't

224
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
How do you prevent this and what did he do

225
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,823
Yeah in this case this is a very interesting case because

226
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,871
Your mother was explained before like

227
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,735
The interaction usually is between the criminal and you know the AT&T or Verizon

228
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Person

229
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:08,415
In this case and what's interesting about this case is that the hacker went directly to the victim normally the interactionism

230
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,207
Between the Acura Criminal

231
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,255
And the cell phone providers

232
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,559
In all customer support person

233
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,143
In Disguise that I can call the victim and essentially tried to it

234
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Stardom

235
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,959
And the victim tried to talk him out of it

236
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,007
This is how you make money

237
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,031
Why don't we

238
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,103
Why don't we talk this through what I help you you see my udemy

239
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
Is there a way you can use some help

240
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,783
I mean with like figuring out how to like make a

241
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,087
Living like that f****** people over

242
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,415
And I feel like semi feel sympathy for

243
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,999
It won't you tell me what

244
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,071
Why are you in a situation where you need this money so badly

245
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
Cuz I did something

246
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
That I truly regret

247
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
About a year ago and

248
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,055
Longer than

249
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
3 months now so

250
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
Okay

251
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,967
That's okay people make mistakes I understand and

252
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,527
And there's no judgment there

253
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,111
Can you be a little more specific with the types of mistakes

254
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,927
So you've made and when what you got yourself into

255
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
Well let's just say I'm a beast

256
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
The wrong guy over

257
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,655
Basically I got

258
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,959
Jonah in the mud

259
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,519
Money right now

260
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,383
Do you know a somebody's been in the situation I had somebody I've had somebody Mentor me

261
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
And help me

262
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
And I would like to be able to give that back to you

263
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Allison

264
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
You threatening me and making me send you Ripple

265
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
To be able to pay someone else back

266
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
It is that's going to be a very temporary fix

267
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,583
Who knows what's next your mindset is wrong

268
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,679
You're just trying to get to the next stop you're not thinking long-term

269
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,007
You're not thinking about the Sebastian who you want to be one day

270
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,591
I don't know who you want to be when I don't know anything about you to know if you have a family

271
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
I don't know if you have

272
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
Parents I don't know anything about you

273
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,247
But you're not thinking about the Sebastian

274
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,551
Who wants to create the life for himself

275
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,951
That is what you were going to want in your future you're not thinking about that you're just thinking about how do I get

276
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,839
$3,000 or 10. Whatever it is to get myself out of this situation and get by for the next 6 months am I right

277
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,167
Yeah I guess you might be right

278
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,703
So basically I did was

279
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983
He

280
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,079
Engaged his Humanity the hackers Humanity something you don't see very often

281
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,871
Yeah and that's

282
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
That's something that

283
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,199
Working this case I think because

284
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,807
Some of the people doing this kind of attacks are usually very young Atlas

285
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
You know the people that we've been able to

286
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Identify

287
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
Or talking about like

288
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,999
Teenagers or early 20s

289
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
You know I know this is going to sound it'll be like a stereotype but these guys are really like like a guy in a hoodie is parents basement

290
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
Yeah it's really likes you know the people that have been identified and arrested so far in DeSoto

291
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,895
TurboTax are all I think the oldest one that we know of was like

292
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,503
26 or 27 I think there was a guy that was 30 something

293
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,343
I bet he was like one nineteen-year-old 121 year old

294
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
You know I sent you a people that I've

295
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,487
Either just left high school and or just got into

296
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,047
College Seducer all essential young men

297
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,327
Not having

298
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
Fully developed

299
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Frontal cortex

300
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
Exactly I mean it's as much as it sounds like a stereotype of the hacker it weighs like that it's like young people there

301
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,591
Gamers sometimes they're very upset

302
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
Obsessive gamers

303
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
These guys are young a male

304
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,991
Board that you know like if maybe

305
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
If it's a more than all that much to do because they're out of school

306
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,951
So yeah I threw you like young people with not that much to do and some

307
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,743
Death some skills obviously because

308
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:00,607
They know how to trick people into doing what they want so their social engineers

309
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
So this particular case though

310
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,959
This guy doesn't seem so much bored

311
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Adidas

312
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Desperate

313
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,383
I think what happened here is that the criminal went through the usual protocol quote-unquote

314
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
Or this kind of attack

315
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,991
And basically ran into a wall

316
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
You realize that

317
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
The only chance

318
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,135
To get what he wanted was to actually

319
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,671
Story. Of the victim

320
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,023
I think it was kind of a Hail Mary he just went for it and hope that it could like

321
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
Compass direction to

322
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Give him what he wants

323
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,863
And

324
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
She end up getting

325
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
Can you give me an apology

326
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
I wish you wouldn't have ended

327
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,503
Well

328
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
I respect that

329
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Yeah man

330
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
Alpine you know

331
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,671
I think

332
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,511
Do you have potential in just got to go down the right path

333
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,327
Just go to sleep and touch base tomorrow

334
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
All right

335
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
Iron Man

336
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
Sebastian

337
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727
I appreciate you being there

338
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
Stand up human being

339
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
Yeah

340
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,383
Thank you

341
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,711
Good night buddy

342
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:20,735
Good night

343
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
Good morning

344
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,463
In a way these are really targeted tax obviously because they

345
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,023
The hackers are going for specific people

346
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:33,791
What types

347
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,071
Two people are retarded

348
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,375
It could be anyone

349
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:43,519
But only in the sense that to become a Target or a victim you need to be someone that has something that they want

350
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
2018 Tigers actually wants

351
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,615
Bitcoin

352
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Why did Yuan

353
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
It depends

354
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,735
Sometimes obviously Bitcoin is very

355
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
Appealing because it's

356
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,807
Essentially money

357
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
Special unit last year when I was like worth so much

358
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
Other times

359
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:03,743
They attack you because they know they have a bank account so they want to get money

360
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:08,095
All the times is more unusual or something that you would have thought about

361
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,447
Sometimes they target you because you have an interesting

362
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,727
Social media handle

363
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,287
And by interesting susmita handle I mean

364
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,359
Something that is short or something that spells out

365
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,919
A common name like rainbow or sex

366
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Sore

367
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
Video games or something like that

368
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,807
The reason why that's interesting is that

369
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,087
There's a

370
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,391
Son of a gray Market online

371
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
What is social media handles

372
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,487
So if I steal your you know at

373
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
Facts or at Rainbow

374
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,327
Handle for Rainbow Six

375
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,423
Yeah Rainbow Six I can then sell it for

376
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,215
Practically a lot of money on this

377
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Weird

378
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
Community called OG users

379
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:53,151
And when I say a lot of money I'm not talking about you know millions of dollars but

380
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,991
It can be like 100 200 Maybe

381
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,783
1000 mm

382
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,391
I don't know how much of this is the legend that I'm watching this is truth cuz it's really hard to verify but

383
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,767
I heard those stories of like handles being sold for 20000 $30,000

384
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
And you know again let's remember these are like

385
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,119
A really young people that

386
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
A lot of money for

387
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
College student

388
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,007
So is it rare for you to see these types of hackers being

389
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Sympathetic

390
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Yes

391
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Because

392
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,383
You know when you think about criminal sometimes

393
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,455
You think about the stereotype you know it's like

394
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,223
Ruthless

395
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
And

396
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,343
You know you're thinking about the bad guy that will do whatever it takes

397
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
What they want

398
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,671
An office in this case you know

399
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:40,511
We're still talking about criminals but you don't dare you mind and again their young

400
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,863
So I think some of them just don't realize what they're doing anyway

401
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,655
Like I'm not trying to justify them both

402
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
I think that

403
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,495
The interesting thing here is that

404
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
Some of them don't think that what they're doing is

405
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Crime

406
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
And they don't think there's a victim

407
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:01,759
Essentially they just want something and they think they're somehow entitled to it

408
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
And

409
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,319
They don't think there's anything wrong

410
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
It's kind of like a game like your style of them are gamers

411
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,743
Yeah exactly I think they do see it as a game and that's probably why they also do it in groups

412
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
Troodon group

413
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
Because

414
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,863
In a typical attack is good to have a few people cuz

415
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
I heard stories of like

416
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,751
Attacks where someone was let's A1 gang member

417
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:27,615
Was trying to find personal information about the victim

418
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
Another one was

419
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
Calling the you know his cell phone provider

420
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,807
And another one maybe was handling the actual lyca SIM card

421
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
So

422
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,415
Not only that's like a division of a skilled and labor I guess

423
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,999
But it's also probably like a little bit of a game you don't deserve maybe guys the

424
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:47,839
Play fortnite together and then when they got bored

425
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
Playing fortnite

426
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,423
They play this other game which is stealing

427
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,495
PlayStation handles or Instagram accounts

428
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
From

429
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Total

430
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
Strangers

431
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
But in this case it's not some guy

432
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
In the city

433
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
Is Basehor maybe it is

434
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
But even sell this

435
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
This particular person

436
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Come across as

437
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
Really emotionally

438
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Actually human

439
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,415
Yeah that we have another interesting case like that to this was like

440
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
Two people

441
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,279
Two criminals they call the Beast couple in Utah

442
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
And they

443
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,887
Well they hacked her because she had the

444
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,679
Instagram account at Rainbow

445
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,775
That's what they wanted because they thought it was

446
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
What's something

447
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
And they called her because they took

448
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
Need to cover her phone number

449
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,711
But they couldn't get into her

450
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
Twitter I think

451
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
They were able to get into her email

452
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,647
I'm getting to her Instagram but they wanted their her Twitter account which was also at Rainbow

453
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:50,047
Because the other thing is that if you have a rainbow on both Twitter and Instagram then it's worth more than just a dream

454
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
Rainbow on Instagram

455
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,679
So they called her and essentially they were like hey

456
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,983
Give us your Twitter account is like

457
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
No

458
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:06,175
And it wasn't it wasn't another interesting case because they played I don't think they did on purpose

459
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,759
Are they played good cop bad cop so the first guy that called

460
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
Was like

461
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:15,391
You know f*** you give us your Twitter without ruining your life

462
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
You know what God has for you

463
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
And then Wendy's Capital started to like

464
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,536
Waste our time and

465
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,400
They also tried to talk them out of it it didn't really work but they were sort of like you know slowing them down

466
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
Then the second guy came onto the phone call

467
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,544
And was like hey I'm sorry about my friend

468
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,080
He's a little bit of a

469
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,384
Yeah he's a little bit angry whatever

470
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,944
We're just trying to be nice

471
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,224
We just want your Twitter

472
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,856
And so it is just like I remember interviewing the Kapil and they were like

473
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:51,232
Obviously we were very stressful so we were like what the hell is going on you know where these people that are like

474
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,560
Now they sound super young and they are just

475
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
They just sound weird

476
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,400
How much money are they getting out of a

477
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,520
Some people are probably making very little money because only go for is like this

478
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,336
You know Twitter handle them into Commandos

479
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,640
Add event after esl which is

480
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
You never know how you're going to get money or not

481
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
But the the real

482
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,064
Criminals in my cereal I mean the diprose

483
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,344
So to speak

484
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,464
Are the ones who go after Bitcoin investors and cryptocurrency investors and those people

485
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
Are making millions

486
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Like little Millions

487
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,632
We reported on the case of a guy called Joel Ortiz

488
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,704
Who is a 19 year old guy from Boston

489
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:37,824
And he was part of the gang you don't deserve see my Jack and gang

490
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,128
And he's accused of stealing

491
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
Something like

492
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
Five or six million dollars

493
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
Throughout

494
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
A few months

495
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:51,136
And the way they did it was essentially targeting people that they knew had a lot of money

496
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,952
It's still unclear exactly how they chose targets

497
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,000
One of the few

498
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
Mysteries

499
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Of these cases

500
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,400
But what they did was Target people that were like

501
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:06,240
Publicly talking about their Investments on cryptocurrency

502
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,824
Think about people that are on Twitter talking about how I made like

503
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,640
X amount of money investing in this

504
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
Token artist

505
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,944
Cryptocurrency whatever

506
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:21,088
And then they went after their phone numbers and ones that their phone numbers they could get into their like

507
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,392
Coinbase or Gemini

508
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
Or whatever cryptocurrency website you can think of

509
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
And

510
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
Take all their money

511
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,328
Savannah to me with one of those handles that they're after

512
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,376
Maybe medical likely to get hacked

513
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,704
But I'm hearing more that this hack is possible

514
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,728
On anyone

515
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Yeah I mean

516
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,544
Obviously if you're like

517
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,128
Someone who brags on Twitter about their

518
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,920
Cryptocurrency Investments

519
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
You should be careful

520
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,736
If you're someone who has

521
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,296
You know one of these cool

522
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:57,696
And those you should be careful but it really could happen to anyone and it's not just you know I don't want to scare anyone and you shouldn't be scared

523
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,976
Because there are ways to

524
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,792
Minimize the risks of these attacks

525
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
But it could be anyone because

526
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,936
In the last year when I was reporting on the stories I really heard from

527
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,728
Average people

528
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,496
Images

529
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,800
Regular people like me and you and

530
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,104
The only reason they got targeted because

531
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,224
Some twenty-year-old thought that they had someone in their bank or someone in their cryptocurrency account

532
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,040
And they were easy to Target because there

533
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,576
Information was in line

534
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,856
And so they went after them

535
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:30,720
So that the takeaway here is that it could happen to you there are ways to minimize the risk

536
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,536
Event happening to you or you losing money

537
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,376
You know I've got an emails and voicemails from

538
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,704
50 year old mom son year old guys

539
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,824
It could really be anyone because all you need to become a Target is essentially be someone

540
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:50,432
Cool maybe it's the money or maybe it's something that can be worth some money

541
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
