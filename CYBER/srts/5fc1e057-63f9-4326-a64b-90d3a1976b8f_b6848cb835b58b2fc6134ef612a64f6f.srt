My Friends by Queen released

25
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
Surprised by texting me

26
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,624
Who's happier you are the hackers I don't know

27
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
Yeah I mean

28
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,696
It was chill with me

29
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
But just bad timing you

30
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:43,328
It should just write just a chill New Year's Eve talking too dark

31
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
Overlord

00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,424

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
Singing

34
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,752
Some pretty inconvenient times

35
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
But that's just a start again

36
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Are you certain

37
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
To walk me through this

38
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,664
Who is dark Overlord because that name is

39
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
To me that's just a

40
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,224
Classic

41
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
Beautiful

42
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
Old school hacker naming

43
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,928
Yeah so this may be the first time as some people go to the doctor

44
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,464
I saw subtracting to the min

45
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
2016

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
When they were hacking medical centers

47
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,096
A listing that dates on the dark web

48
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,168
I would deliberately make her already high price

49
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
So he clearly wasn't

50
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,824
And then they started talking to media room

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
Giving them dato to them even more pressure on the rectum

52
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,664
And they

53
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
Changed over time is God love most

54
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
Sophisticated

55
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Brazen

56
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,856
Some of the facts and campaigns now

57
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
I just really

58
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,952
Over-the-top dramatic

59
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
What's the violence

60
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
In a way

61
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
And then

62
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,376
16

63
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,960
CCR violin swing by violin

64
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
Yeah but maybe find the song

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,592
That really aggressive

66
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,432
So when they were exposing one company they sent me the text

67
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
Descendants 2 the daughter

68
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
All the CEO of someone like that

69
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
It was stuff like tell Mommy and Daddy

70
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
We have everything and they going to give us

71
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
In one case

72
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,744
Stay Gold Austin

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
That's what they said from schools

74
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,887
And then used it to send mass text messages to the children saying hey

75
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:24,191
We going to come shoot some blow up your school

76
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,983
Today in Toronto

77
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
Lego

00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
How the heck is what

79
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,407
When it comes to that Brazen the snow Christmas

80
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,991
Funnily enough really open with that

81
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
Motivation

82
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
They very clearly say when.

83
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:44,415
So activists we care about magic internet money

84
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
That's all they care about

85
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,231
They just want money

86
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
Yeah

87
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,583
Where is some tattoos made

88
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
The motivation

89
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
Magistrate's Office

90
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
And it comes across as pretty genuine

91
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,263
They just totally financially motivated

92
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,311
Maybe it Tanya citigo

93
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,591
Is Stephanie the money

94
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,663
This is a clear a clear example of sort of like

95
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
Black hat

96
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,575
Straight up like I know Grace with the only way

97
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,439
Maybe will be a slightly different stages when they released these

98
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,535
Electric 911

99
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
I don't care about that school

100
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,703
What is this 911

101
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,751
Legal firm hack

102
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
About what do they do

103
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,079
So

104
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
Duncanville O-Town

105
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:35,871

00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,247
Atleagle family links to hiscox knotheads Cox directly

108
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,343
Link to it which handled some litigation around a 911.

109
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,135
Several years ago

00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,207
Hiscox has she announced the breach your neighbor

111
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
2018

00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,631
So that it isn't you but that what is happening is the Taco Bell is going public saying you're going to get us money

113
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703

Publix

119
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,663

Loose Change 9/11 conspiracy theories

Really

126
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,423
In a drip-feed fashion and style is a few preview documents and then they also sent out

127
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
When they release the key

128
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,079
And to be honest the actual documents themselves interesting in the moment

129
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,895
Best legal letters between penalties and Lewis

130
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,479
The TSA in the

131
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
And they seem quite innocuous

132
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,135
I know maybe the saving the really good stuff until the end cuz I still need incentive for the victim

133
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
Hey

134
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695

00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:00,351
Conspiracy theories I mean my inbox is now full of people who would not stop emailing me

Yeah just a load of people and a load of 911 truth is in my inbox

151
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,703
But I mean if you're to go by historically this dark Overlord group

152
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,799
They haven't been bulshit they've had stuff in the past I've been out of there not been

153
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823

School days stuff from Gorilla Glue

158
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
The little blue company

159
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
They have two real igloo

160
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
Yeah they had a really good witch

161
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,351

00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,167
Yeah that's how I'll get the wine

163
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,519
The cost of Industries the every single day every single piece of HR procedure

164
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
Has

165
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,359
Turned out to be legitimate maybe that changes later on

166
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,151
The

167
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
Past experience

168
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,199
Pikachu

169
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Do they have Gorilla Glue I mean what

170
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,039
Why and what did they do

171
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,111
Bugatti for any Target

172
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,159
Did they can compromise and then try to make

173
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,719
So in the case of Gorilla Glue

174
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,815
Bagel 500 gigabytes of data personal emails professional stuff

175
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
I think some text messages as well

176
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
And they even

177
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:43,519
Because I was saying that Lil we have the secret formula at all of Gorilla Glue

178
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
And some upcoming photo switch

179
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:51,967
Wasn't the most enticing and parolee wasn't in the greatest public interest so I didn't really mention that but

180
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
In the world itself

181
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,783
Just because

182
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,319
Anyone there

183
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,879
And was like gorilla glue do they have

184
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,183
Cyber security team that could help them

185
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,207
Respond to that store

186
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,023
Not that I'm aware off

187
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,327
I mean presumably they did bring in

188
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,167
Play forensic people lost with that seems to be a theme in that

189
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,471
Come people get pops by the dark Overlord

190
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,031
And then by Raul who ever Maybe

191
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,311
Will come in

192
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,639
Call the clean up after that

193
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
I mean when it comes on

194
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,759
You don't have to think about it very much because

195
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,783
Straight away

196
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,855
The dark Overlord will tell the victim hey it's us

197
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,927
Is the previous stuff we've done and I've seen these emails

198
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,487
And this is why the media comes in

199
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,559
Because the dock of Zelda with hospice like

200
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,119
Archival portfolio of work

201
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
They can send that to the victim

202
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,983
Hey do you want to be impossible with oil

203
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,031
Why I don't want a friend maybe like

204
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,311
They can see this

205
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
Anakin makes up restaurant

206
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,151
Have they ever called the victim

207
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
And extorted them

208
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,271
Oh yeah so it was one case where an associate

209
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,599
I think he was an actual name member

210
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,903
Someone who went by the

211
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,231
Handle across the Cockney who was arrested

212
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
A couple years ago

213
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,119
They bring up the victims and they have these really busy over the top

214
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,983
Audio tracks like SoundCloud rap

215
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,567
On the phone with like a beast in the background likes things

216
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
Hey I thought you said

217
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
Do you have that

218
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
Yeah yeah we have nothing we can play

219
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
Hello

220
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,599
Levi gets to decide

221
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
You can suck my dick

222
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,487
Tell you that I love you

223
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,631
You work in fact that you've got a good beat

224
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
Chuck-E-Cheese

225
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:48,959
Check it out

226
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
We probably going to get one cool for me

227
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
Funny looking sure deserve a problem

228
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,271
I'm going to call you some fuk

229
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
You work at Weis

230
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Have a good day

231
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
This plays into by the overdraft

232
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,631
Progressive

233
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,983
Nonsensical Whimsical and just really unprotect

234
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
Empezar like that

235
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,335
Change that targets will change from

236
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,639
Two schools to businesses.

237
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:35,039
Potentially government contractors they will send these audio recordings that will send text messages to students are schools in Russell Springs

238
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
They

239
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:43,487
I mean I guess this is like like classic like they're classic hackers who really don't

240
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,839
They really don't give a f*** and they really

241
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
I tried to talk with the victim

242
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
Every way they can I mean I've had conversations

243
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Bands with one member

244
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
But he's talking about how they

245
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Psychologically

246
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
Try to manipulate

247
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:06,015
I know what I'm doing and it's incredibly deliberate

248
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
And

249
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
And your steering contact your in contacts

250
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
So it comes and goes

251
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
Are your interactions with

252
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Service

253
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Black hat hackers

254
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
Yeah I mean starting

255
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,191
In 2016 may be very active on Orem salon

256
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,263
Encrypted chat with something and then they may just appear

257
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
I did maybe even longer

258
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
Backup offer some dates

259
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,199
We not interested because it's not a public interest or is the target which is umbrella

260
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,247
A reason or something

261
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
And then they just randomly came back with his 911

262
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
Free stuff

263
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
So

264
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,647
Yeah they're really unpredictable

265
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
But when they do come up

266
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
They probably have something of Interest

267
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
I mean it's interesting as well because

268
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,119
They have so many assists scattershot of targets

269
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,447
I mean I haven't heard of hackers that

270
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
We'll sort of

271
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Hawk

272
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,775
The formula

273
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Of some weird

274
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,079
You know kind of

275
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Ridiculous

276
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,175
Industrial company like Gorilla Glue that

277
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,527
You know do you want the recipe for the glue except for Chinese hackers that are trying to

278
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,575
Take this and give it to

279
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,183
Sumner corporate attorneys within China I mean it's just you have

280
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,743
The law firm that dealt with 9/11

281
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,351
How do you know who it is

282
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
The start of the

283
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,167
The theme that's it

284
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,727
Seems to be a wide array of people

285
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
Yeah and then also even the Production Studio

286
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
Links Netflix

287
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
So then the end of leaking in the Orange is the New Black in the various other episodes is like the shows they will just go

288
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,807
Did the

289
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Yes I didn't hack

290
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
Netflix directly it was a production

291
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
Studio

292
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,023
But cannot just shows if they can get access to something

293
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
Crew

294
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,327
Ace Hood Posse

295
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
What's something like that then they're going to do that

296
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
I've got a hell of a lot of coverage

297
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,383
Yeah and if you read how it was covers

298
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
It was clear

299
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:14,527
The Down koplo News if I went to variety as a novice the Entertainer publication

300
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,831
Is going to carry move like that because it's Netflix

301
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,975
Open sleeper it they think a frontal more information before they gave it to me

302
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,815
The rarest battery when it comes to choosing Outlet

303
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
To get MS

304
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
They're very sad

305
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
Yeah they know exactly what they're doing

306
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
They already meet you Saturday in that they

307
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
Will attempt to entice

308
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:39,871
Agenda list with the correct amount of dates

309
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
And Abel

310
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Go to different Outlet

311
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Story is here

312
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,783
I need something like Phineas Fisher

313
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,343
That I've spoken to before

314
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,439
You you you know it it's Representatives one person

315
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,743
But my suspicion was always it was 7

316
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,071
This is the case here is the same thing here

317
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Yeah I know

318
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
I imagine

319
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Is multiple

320
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
Because there are so many different

321
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,239
Office operation

322
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
I mean they have hacked

323
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
At least

324
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
50 Target

325
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
I'm not walls

326
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,151
That was when I wrote about the last year

327
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
17 quiet for a while

328
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Probably beaten

329
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Working in the meantime

330
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
Debra a rapist

331
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,903
And pee like a resource logistical level one test and probably can't do that

332
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,999
Blending conversations with them release date

333
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
Who said I am leaning

334
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,583
I just like the

335
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,423
The professionalisation of it they sends to fix

336
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,215
A literal contract

337
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,567
And it says like the taco veloz Solutions LLC agrees to

338
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,407
If you give us xidan Bitcoin and they make the victim

339
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
Sign a contract

340
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
So so bizarre

341
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,807
It seems to be professional in industrialization of the

342
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Extortion

343
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,135
Whimsical nature

344
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
Contract

345
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,791
Yeah it's like they've got a Comm specialist a lawyer

346
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,071
Hacker

347
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
Who's doing the

348
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
Miscommunication

349
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:16,127
There's a lot of media contacts going on here especially now with the 9/11.

350
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
The times Financial Times

351
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
American Publications as well

352
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,271
Like this, be one person

353
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
Whatever it is it's

354
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,623
It's pretty I mean

355
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,391
Kind of Genius

356
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Yeah

357
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Evil Tina

358
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
And

359
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
The most malicious

360
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Come across

361
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Genuinely

362
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,655
I mean you have state taxes are we doing it

363
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
Is a bad job

364
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:44,031
Because it's too late country so that maybe pacifism in the states

365
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
Unemployment

366
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
Is it just about the money but they come about

367
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,271
So happy we're going after let's say when you look at something like the iCloud hack

368
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
Have they gone after celebrity

369
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
Please before

370
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,391
Yeah so they targeted a plastic surgery in London

371
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,183
Which

372
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,511
Serves to several different celebrities are allegedly

373
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
Royal family members as well

374
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,583
I couldn't confirm

375
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
Royal family members

376
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
To speak

377
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
And send the celebrity side

378
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,983
To verify

379
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Dante's

380
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,055
They sent me a load of photos off

381
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
Pre and post

382
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,895
Plastic surgery operations which of course included

383
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,687
Lots of photos of people

384
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
But that is

385
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
Information

386
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,367
Teejet identify pajamas

387
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,207
And this was like Hey if you don't pay we're going to release these photos

388
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,791
Shoutouts to prince Andrew for no reason at all

389
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
I don't know

390
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
If they edit a

391
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
Slight twist in that story

392
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,751
Plastic surgery the IT guy that

393
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,823
Trying to send the dark Overlord a malicious file

394
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
Witchwood reveal their IP address

395
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
And told them

396
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,967
I should have done that

397
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,063
Wow today they're on top of their game

398
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
Opsec

399
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,647
Is pretty incredible

400
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,207
As far as I know

401
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,487
I mean everybody makes

402
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
Mistakes

403
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
These are one of the most

404
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Solid

405
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
Discipline

406
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,887
Increase of democracy

407
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,191
And how would the authorities

408
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
The FBI's

409
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,591
Definitely eveline investigating

410
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
This group as a UK authorities

411
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
I mean

412
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,991
It was even a

413
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
Nyko press event a while ago

414
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,623
FBI director Christopher Wray

415
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
Perhaps another couple

416
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
Basically they have penis

417
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
Scribus

418
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Which

419
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
I don't

420
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
Agree with

421
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,887
Is Terrorism is a break Pacific thing big tiny kids United

422
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
Saladin viewed by the rapper

423
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
Namely

424
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,007
Pick up victims

425
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,799
Damping heavily

426
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,615
Investigation to the point where

427
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,711
That was a security researcher very was very pleasing

428
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:02,527
He did nothing wrong

429
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
For the FBI

430
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,135
Local law enforcement been really hard on him

431
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
Trying to link

432
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
So

433
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
I would not be surprised

434
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
I like some of the

435
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
The Talk

436
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
If you know Chinese

437
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
I mean with all due respect

438
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
The authorities it's not as if they're taking

439
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
Power grid at least not yet

440
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,567
It's just

441
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,335
It is

442
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,383
Quite stranger these guys

443
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Philippine currency

444
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
At least

445
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
2016

446
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
I just saw

447
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
Publicly

448
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,831
I give you an apt like more the government group

449
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
Typically clients

450
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
Insinuating the soccer field is

451
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,023
It's just that

452
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
They are certainly the Pea

453
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
Baby teeth

454
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
And I still going

455
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,959
If anything

456
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
More more aggressive

457
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,775
Have any authorities

458
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Caught anybody

459
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Connected to

460
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,103
Dark Overlord

461
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
So

462
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
The authorities arrest

463
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
Nikon he used to handle

464
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,295
Crossed the company in the UK

465
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
Somehow connects to the group

466
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,623
Alan Serbian authorities

467
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
Someone

468
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
They say it's also connected

469
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,767
To the dark overlord by perhaps lemon winter

470
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,143
When that happens

471
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,703
The darker blue Xanax High

472
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
And they just carry on

473
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
Abnormal I mean it have no impact

474
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,407
Or least no visible impact on the reparations

475
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
Maybe that's because

476
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:42,111
People who do get busted and then operation or perhaps

477
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
Date of service billing and I can carry on

478
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,975
Well maybe that person Serbian guy

479
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,999
I shouldn't have anything to do

480
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,535
We don't know this

481
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,095
Even when authorities do

482
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
Debbie's really smooth

483
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,655
Apparently connect

484
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,775
I haven't

485
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,311
I haven't heard of a group this

486
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,871
Successful that doesn't seem to have anything

487
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Connected to the midterms

488
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
The Heat

489
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,479
Because the only one I can think of is Phineas

490
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
It's just completely

491
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
We stopped

492
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Authorities

493
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,855
Yeah they just going and going and going

494
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,416
And showing no signs of slowing down I mean

495
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
They'll probably

496
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,024
Get shipped eventually like maybe a cup

497
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Fugazi

498
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
No yeah

499
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,656
Mean everyone's luck runs out usually

500
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
But

501
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
So far this group seems

502
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,752
I mean their opsec is impressive

503
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
I mean maybe they have made mistakes

504
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:40,480
If they had you would think the FBI would be kicking down doors

505
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Immediately

506
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
And not to mention I mean you look at PCH

507
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:50,208
HQ you look at the authorities in in England and these are pretty

508
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,744
I'm going to tell you this

509
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,792
Dupree outstandingly

510
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
Powerful agency

511
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
That have a

512
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,144
Pretty Keen sense what's going on

513
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
British Network

514
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,472
Yes exactly

515
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,568
Gchq is working on it but they have

516
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
Recently

517
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Play Store

518
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
Combating cybercrime

519
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,224
Tostito

520
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
I wouldn't be surprised but yet

521
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
The Dock of Louisiana have

522
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
Mount snow demos

523
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
Capable

524
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
And yet they just keep on going

525
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
So I mean I know you just

526
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:31,680
Got in touch with them for the first time in a little while but I mean what's next for this 911 story and wheezing

527
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Next for dark Overlord

528
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
Lourdes to

529
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
Trying to push out this 911 story

530
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,360
Released one of the

531
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
Decryption keys

532
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,688
They trying to crowdsource

533
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,760
Some more as in castles in Bitcoin in ml

534
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
Maybe at once

535
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,624
I imagine they'll trying to

536
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,160
Documents

537
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,232
I don't see them jumping the whole thing just yet

538
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
I will be playing

539
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,792
Ola psycards

540

Story out more interviews or die

543
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,264
Chemist is well

544
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,568
That's what happens for the dark Overlord next

545
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
I mean

546
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
This one

547
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
Sage

548
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:16,224
Over the next few days or a week maybe something like that the media loses interest

549
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,528
Uno's

550
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
Quiet

551
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
And then

552
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
The police bring up again

553
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,416

With another hack

555
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
I mean

556
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
Sounds like it

557
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,840
Exactly I mean they are alive

558
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:38,240
