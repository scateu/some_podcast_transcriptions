The 2020 us elections

As an opportunity to advance their interest

32
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,136
Will the internet research agency Russian Troll Army strike again

33
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,952

00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072

The counter the attack

38
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
No one knows the answers but everyone

39
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
Is freaking out

40
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
On this week's cyber we talked to the Grog

41
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:24,384
Probably the closest thing to an infosec celebrity in the entire world

42
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,272
The drug recently spoke about how the internet has changed its information and information operations

43
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,296
Annie's here today

45
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392
Youku

46
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
And this is cyber

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
What's with what's with the name Satya Sai saw

48
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
What's the status

49
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
Big rock now it's

50
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
What's that

51
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,888
Oh

52
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:51,008
So I basically I figured that people were freaking out that I was the Grog too much

53
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,824
Okay so I made it obvious

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,384
So it was more like a normal name

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Right people

56
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
Freak out less even though

57
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,040
Xavier seed drug sounds

58
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,904
More crazy than Grog dinner it sounds like way more boarding school

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Do you know what I mean

60
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,000
Bright like a boarding school

61
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,608
You act like you want for my internet Incognito straight till like

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
Chetan Hill Repertory

63
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,192
It's cool or whatever

64
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
It's the only thing that makes

65
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Make any sense

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
Flight status

67
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Yeah

68
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,480
The broadcast Maybe

69
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Changing up

70
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,624
So your Fanboys and fans

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,392
. just

72
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
They're upset about it

73
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,256
I know but like

74
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
It was

75
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,072
Weird like basically

76
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
People will have a

77
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,448
Sorry for some reason they're they're pretty negative in their opinions of me

78
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
And so

79
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,776
I figured that

80
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,616
To some extent it was the fact that I didn't have like a normal name

81
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,296
Like I've already seen that there's like a change and some of the comments that people have liked that they're less

82
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,368
I bet they don't focus on the name as much

83
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
Anymore

84
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,928
Right I got used to be

85
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
The thing that might help people off

86
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
But it seems not to anymore

87
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
I mean we were just discussing this and

88
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,423
We were all of the opinion that you're kind of one of the most

89
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,983
You may be RV infosec

90
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
Celebrity

91
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
Which is

92
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,871
Kind of funny but everyone knows you

93
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
Yeah yeah I find that very very crazy like

94
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015
If it makes no sense to me at all

95
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,671
I mean you clearly know you're talking about how do you why you think you became so popular among everyone

96
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,231
Everyone have you heard people be like I know

97
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:48,511
What is actually

98
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:49,791
Okay

99
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
Cool man

100
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,887
You know I really don't know I think

101
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
Part of it is that

102
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,007
Other people have been working for a living and I've been unemployed

103
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
So just been able to like

104
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,431
Stay engaged and I don't have people censoring the output that I have so I can just

105
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
No right and posts

106
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,039
@will whatever I feel like

107
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,319
And since

108
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,087
You know I'm not

109
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,111
A complete idiot

110
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:19,999
Can putting out stuff that I think is good and has good analysis and other people can see that

111
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,791
And so

112
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,351
Like volume stuff

113
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
And then

114
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
I'm also kind of an a******

115
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
Go to bed

116
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
So I don't really read the whole back when like

117
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,895
If someone pisses me off or like they do something stupid or like

118
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:40,479
Company makes mistakes I don't really soft pedal

119
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
That much

120
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,903
Probably don't have that like crowdstrike or you know Facebook

121
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,207
Handler being like you got to stay quiet

122
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,351
There's not someone who censoring me

123
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Am I part but

124
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:03,775
Yeah. Have someone going like you need to corporate-speak this I can just go like what f****** idiot would do

125
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,431
Look at these morons 8230 web shells to get some data

126
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
Not like well you know

127
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
Play serious breach

128
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
Level of sophistication fairly on CNN

129
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
So you know getting to another

130
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
You big Topic in the end

131
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,535
Infosec right now I mean actually I would say

132
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
It's just a topic that

133
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Keeps on giving to the last

134
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:29,887
3 years

135
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
You see the end of it

136
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
Russian hackers

137
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Information

138
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
And you you rehearsing spoke

139
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,335
About how the internet blew up in

140
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Warfare

141
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
So I was just wondering

142
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
How do you think

143
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
The internet

144
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,015
Quote on quote

145
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,295
Has changed

146
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
It's it's weird and some I so like

147
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,439
I personally don't believe

148
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,207
Stats

149
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:57,535
What was the troll Farm stuff had as big an impact

150
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
As the media likes to portray

151
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,143
The media likes to say that

152
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,983
The troll farms and everything at a huge impact because it's absolves them

153
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
There their coverage of the leaked emails

154
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,639
New leaked emails was what really

155
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
Through things

156
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
That was a major

157
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,479
Impact

158
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
Nike campaign that was the

159
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Big saying

160
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
Mutual Farms

161
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
You know like they probably just speaking me

162
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,487
You're speaking to a small audience you know preaching to the choir to degree

163
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,511
But

164
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
All that aside

165
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:34,911
Fascinating brother troll Farms is if you if you want to explore how that

166
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,447
Total propaganda

167
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
Has changed from the historical

168
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,615
Propaganda that we had available I'm going to just look at specifically

169
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,175
Black propaganda which is what they were

170
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,479
Doing whatever impersonating

171
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:53,087
Members of the target audience to active like we're one of you and here's what we think

172
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
I never thought of it that way

173
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
Insightful perspective

174
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
Gay people

175
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
Star Lawn

176
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,495
Used to happen when when Black Hawk Down there was being dumb

177
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,543
Is that you would be

178
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,847
Trying to imagine yourself

179
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
Into the position

180
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,967
Of your target audience than you'll be some trying to

181
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,551
Create a message what you want to do

182
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:29,439
Empathize with a message that speaks to them as if you care about them

183
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,559
Message to direct them to do something that's not in there

184
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Best interest

185
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,351
In your best interest

186
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,167
It's a fairly difficult thing to do

187
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
Also

188
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
It's it's

189
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,823
Complex you know you need to have someone who really really knows

190
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
That target audience

191
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,687
And that is a very hard thing to get these days

192
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
What internet is allowed

193
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
Is you don't actually need someone who really really knows the target audience anymore or you can simply

194
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
Test the reaction in real time

195
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
To how a particular messages doing

196
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,583
And the feedback loop is now very very Tite

197
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
It's literally in real time

198
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,679
You can tell which messages

199
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,239
Are rednecks in which messages are working

200
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
And you can

201
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,799
Course correct

202
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,127
As you go along and so

203
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,199
Allison historical you needed to serve genius-guy

204
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,503
We come up with these ideas you throw them out

205
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
4 hours called a comeback which

206
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
Return on weather

207
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,207
The message has landed or had an impact

208
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
And this could be

209
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,071
You know you your release a rumor

210
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,607
In France

211
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
I need wait for it to show up in Turkey

212
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,447
Did measure how long that took

213
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,471
And it's alright

214
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:52,127
If it's not from France to Cherokee it must have resonated quite well with the target audience and we can assume that this 8 weeks

215
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:52,895
Journey

216
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
Maybe it went through Germany as well

217
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
So

218
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,039
Not that seem to work well in this other one that didn't show up didn't work well

219
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,599
So you have this may be in about 2 months

220
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,159
Lead time to get any feedback

221
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,999
I'm 2 months and awards are the really long time

222
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
These days

223
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
You can have

224
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
Is he back within seconds

225
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
So

226
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Youku

227
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:18,239
I guess that's that's what really changed every

228
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,799
Genius

229
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
By their own stuff tonight

230
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,919
Genius power

231
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,223
This thing is going to work really well

232
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:31,807
Just having something I could go like yours 10 ideas let's see what works

233
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:36,671
Or at least three did ready well the seven pay attention to okay drop those

234
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,719
Out of these three what are some

235
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,487
Variation

236
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,279
Let's see if we can get better engagement

237
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
And that means that you no longer need to have

238
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,399
A genius you don't need to have

239
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
A really really good

240
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,055
Person to do your black propaganda you just need someone who can do data analysis

241
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
And do regular marketing

242
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:55,871
So

243
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,991
These days you basically just need your your basic entry-level marketer and copy editor

244
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,855
And someone to look at your engagement metrics and come back and say okay

245
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,439
Not of this campaign is going really well this one's not going really well

246
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:13,279
Now what do you want to do and then you can maybe test if you wants her in like

247
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,655
All the stuff it's it's no longer necessary to have someone who's good at this you just need someone who's adequate marketing

248
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
And if you just I'm just

249
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
Testing constantly

250
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,567
The history of information Warfare at least

251
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
From a modern contact

252
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
You know like

253
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
Which is why

254
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,223
You're looking at rush has always been

255
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,015
Dee Snider

256
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
New York Rana

257
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:39,135
Created the protocols of Zion

258
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Completely

259
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:47,071
I still going like 1905 1906

260
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,887
It essentially created this whole conspiracy around

261
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,935
A global Zionist movement against

262
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Quote on quote would have been

263
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Most of

264
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
European powers

265
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
It's still in circulation

266
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,103
Denso

267
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,639
I mean look at that but then

268
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,431
You look fast forward 226

269
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
16

270
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
I mean do you think Russia

271
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,271
Got better at it

272
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,807
Or do you think it was just sort of

273
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
Actually

274
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,671
Do you think Russia did a good job in

275
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
Attitude formation War

276
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,351
So I think so

277
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:27,007
Like to be completely fair to the Russians playing information war against the Americans DeSoto playing on easy

278
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:33,919
The Americans are very pretty gullible media is not particularly critical there

279
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,759
Much more chicken by getting things out quickly and then stove patching

280
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Afterwards

281
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
Oops

282
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,135
It turns out we didn't mean that entire story that we ran

283
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
For 2 days

284
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,487
Here's a three-line correction on page 812

285
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
And so

286
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,327
Because

287
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,863
It's a it's a soft target

288
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Russians

289
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Who

290
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
I mean

291
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,335
If you look at the British stuff

292
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,103
That was

293
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,175
The Pinnacle no one has ever been that good again even

294
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,991
The British have lost the ability to do what they did then

295
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
The Russians never met

296
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,599
Pete they still haven't but they haven't dropped

297
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Low

298
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:22,047
No it's Century of being a medium level information Warfare

299
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
Power and they've stayed at that level

300
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,751
The US on of like Nazis Peaks and valleys like when Wars come up when I suddenly need to do a perception management

301
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,823
Propaganda

302
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,359
Since it's our birthday

303
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Forget everything

304
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,943
That's the last time I ever have to do that

305
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,759
And then the next one comes along with

306
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,855
Slowly build up capability in that as soon as it's over they drop it on Wii game

307
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
So

308
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,927
The US has never been particularly good

309
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,511
Britain has basically lost its role

310
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
No one else

311
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,887
Instead of really playing the game very well

312
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,911
So if

313
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,495
If you are like the one-eyed man in the land of the blind

314
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,799
Basically rush it like that

315
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Not the absolute best but

316
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,383
But they're slightly better than everyone else

317
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
Saudi

318
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,711
Interesting things

319
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
Was Russia is that they they're not

320
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
Afraid

321
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,367
Of information Warfare and they also view information Warfare

322
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,671
As part of the

323
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
Job of the intelligence services

324
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
Stay David much more expensive you

325
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,071
On how

326
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:31,167
You've liked these Security Services should work with the state

327
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,055
These are things

328
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,615
Cirrhosis

329
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
Progressive Auto

330
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Yeah

331
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
Very big

332
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Idea fly

333
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
Switch

334
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
You know actually do exist

335
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,975
But it's kind of because of these guys really believe that Russia's being persecuted

336
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
And everyone who can should

337
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
Stand up and join them

338
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,607
And some of my good cybercriminals and

339
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,263
Show some of them

340
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,591
Are legitimate some of them are you helping in person

341
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
All of these things but they

342
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,271
They really have this expensive you which allows them to include civilians as part of their

343
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
National Security apparatus

344
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,439
Recipe book in the US the idea that like you know citizen hackers would help the NSA

345
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
Is

346
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,327
Like it's literally Unthinkable the idea that

347
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,911
If someone has the US hacked Iran

348
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
Stop & Shop

349
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,751
Do you like the NSA

350
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
Iranian stuff has a bunch of information

351
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,871
Then I say we go like all right we've turned it over to the FBI

352
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
You know you're going to get raided

353
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:51,551
Not only that I think

354
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,575
Indian essays

355
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
Also immediately

356
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Did up until

357
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
Released recently

358
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Pretty bad recruit

359
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,511
Just because the perception of the government has

360
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Then what it was

361
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,263
Bicf find a very interesting

362
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:16,383
But likely the sheer hate that the citizens have

363
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
Or

364
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,687
Their security apparatus

365
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
Is very strange to me

366
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,807
I can say that because I've

367
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
Looking at police state I

368
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:30,719
Tonight I live in other countries where you are like the xcr bad things

369
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
You know I guess I've

370
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
I've seen stuff in countries with like

371
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,423
Security Services are actually secret police

372
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,239
Like if you go to the Middle East

373
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,799
Their job is to find anyone who disagrees

374
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
With the government and torture them

375
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
Not like

376
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,175
BFDIA yeah there

377
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,503
Turn of dicks and assholes but they're not literally out there

378
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,623
You're not grabbing people who go to demonstrations and torturing them and killing their family members

379
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,975
A line that they don't cross

380
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:08,607
Despite like all the bad things that they are they can be with the icy icing

381
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
Americans really have a pretty good one

382
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Generally speaking

383
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,495
In terms of their relationship with their citizens

384
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
Ansible Liberty

385
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
Exactly like

386
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
They're pretty good

387
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,151
Like

388
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,039
Compared to what they could be there they're quite as you know people should be happy for that and

389
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,391
I think that there's actually opportunities to do the

390
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,695
Fix the system from within

391
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:40,351
I like you you couldn't say in like it a Middle East Country join the secret police and be like I'm going to

392
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:47,007
Mahabharat from within by climbing the ranks and then getting him to stop

393
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
We have two dissidence

394
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:54,943
But you could join the FBI and be like we need to change the way that we go after Packers

395
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,015
And you could actually do that that would be

396
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,063
A viable thing that you can do

397
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
So

398
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
I think that

399
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:07,231
The recruiting problem is actually hurting the community more than

400
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
It's hurting

401
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
And I like the NSA

402
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,631
Speaking of the intelligence community

403
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
Speaking

404
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,727
Do you think it is prepared

405
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
The 20/20

406
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,335
Election do you think you know cuz there's a store that came out

407
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,639
This week that Trump isn't listening in

408
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,919
Doesn't care

409
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
About the Earth are assessment that

410
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
Alexa

411
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
System is is

412
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Is vulnerable

413
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Do you think it is

414
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,671
Like I said I know that

415
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,231
20/20 is going to be a mess and

416
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,583
Realistically twenty20 has started already

417
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,911
But if you're going to do an infowar campaign you don't slip start

418
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
The week before

419
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,287
It's not like a paper that you can stay up all night and

420
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
Now this is a

421
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,943
Spend a lot of time

422
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
It's right thing and putting the time in in and stuff

423
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:08,415
The long process of building up an audience of gaining credibility

424
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:13,279
Of acquiring data that you're going to use up doing the analysis

425
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
Like all of that stuff I've already started

426
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,655
If you hurt if you're not already preparing

427
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,031
Or your attacks in 2020 now you are very very far behind

428
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:29,407
I think the lack of response to 2016

429
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
Is that is basically signal

430
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,759
That's anyone who wants to

431
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Can get away with

432
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Now this

433
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,111
There's no reason to hold back

434
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,695
So last time you know the Russians are sold out in the Forefront

435
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,511
China has always been involved

436
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
Doing

437
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,863
Investments of shady donations and things like that

438
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
Now

439
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,983
You know they them as well go all out and do whatever they want

440
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:57,311
Shouting simulator if you think I'm doing the money thing

441
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
But they've got cyber capabilities

442
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
They want to

443
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,623
Look up huge botnets on they've been doing a lot of infowar hacking League stuff

444
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:15,231
They found that their operations don't work very well but that's

445
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,559
Not in that neither do their assassination programs either

446
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,703
What's actually fascinating about that is that if you

447
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,983
If you look

448
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
HD coverage

449
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,615
You realize that all of that was an information War campaign

450
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
Run by turkey and it was

451
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
Absolutely brilliant

452
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:38,015
Like I think that that needs to be taught in schools

453
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:38,783
So

454
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,319
Just how brilliant

455
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,111
Did the information campaign was

456
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:42,879
It's coming out of Turkey

457
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
Yeah so like I would say that again

458
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:50,559
Yes obviously somebody did something absolutely horrible and it's great that they're getting

459
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
Done for it

460
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,983
Breaking news tonight in a very dark subject the murder of American base Saudi journalist Jamal khashoggi specifically what is it

461
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,079
De facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing

462
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,407
According to reporting which first broken The Washington Post

463
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
The CIA has concluded the answer is

464
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Yes

465
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:13,087
But unless turkey had run that information campaign the way that they did

466
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:18,464
This level of visibility never would have appeared and if you if you look at it the way that they did it

467
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,792
Was a one they had all the information already

468
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,096
CCTV

469
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Recordings

470
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
I do absolutely everything if they dump

471
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:31,008
What was that at once it would have been one or two new cycles and I'm going to vanished

472
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:35,104
But they kept trickling yes slowly

473
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,480
And the way that they said it was okay again there are rumors of an audio feed

474
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
You know

475
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
Anonymous officials

476
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Suggest

477
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,368
The next day it would be like

478
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,000
Anonymous officials from you not like the CIA confirm there is audio

479
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,792
Then the next it would be like

480
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,072
We have

481
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:58,144
Seen a summary of the audio transcript

482
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Not in the next day if you like

483
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,800
Portions of the old year released so there's always something slightly you

484
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:11,456
And they really played the media very well because they know that like that is immediately if you if you just look at them

485
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,760
Chlamydia from a semiotic point of view

486
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:16,576
What makes something newsworthy is not like a

487
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:19,392
Platonic ideal

488
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,440
Superlative

489
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,488
Novelty and all the stuff so like

490
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:27,584
What they were doing was supposedly this like this is the best

491
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,424
So right now like the best thing we have is

492
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,264
This probably audio the next savior like actually we've got something better

493
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,312
We have confirmation that there is order

494
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
Actually got even better than that we have a

495
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,920
Portion of the audio

496
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
You won't believe what we have

497
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
Something way better than we have

498
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,136
So they they kept

499
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:52,416
Hitting

500
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
Buttons that they knew

501
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,000
The media has to respond to

502
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,840
And that allowed them to spend some of weeks going over this

503
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,888
I'm keeping it on the front page

504
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,424
And because of that

505
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,448
It was

506
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,264
Super effective and I think if

507
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,104
Anyone is going to do infowar correctly

508
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
They should look at how the turkey

509
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,712
People ran that how how turkey

510
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
Did that attack and they should copy that exact

511
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
I got was genius

512
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
And you wonder if that will happen in this

513
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,672
Upcoming election cycle me

514
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
One thing that

515
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
I was speaking with some of the motherboard crowd with

516
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Recently

517
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
Was that

518
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,328
You know the Canadian election is

519
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
Coming up in

520
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,656
319 so

521
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
If you want to sort of

522
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
Test out some New York

523
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Capabilities in

524
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,752
See how they might work in

525
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,520
Can a similar

526
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Country

527
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
To the United States

528
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,592
Domino's Pizza

529
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Perfect opportunity

530
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:50,272
Yeah I've been invited to be involved with a couple of Canadian election security things that I'm working

531
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,832
And all I'm with the government

532
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Yeah yeah

533
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
Aware of this

534
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
Now that they need to

535
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,488
Weekly Insider we're asking

536
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,888
Is Kaiser prepared for a social media Cyber attack like the one the Tilted the 2016 US elections

537
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
From my point of view I think

538
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,240
A lot of people serve

539
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
Overestimate their value

540
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
Targets

541
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,616
So I don't know that

542
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,480
And I don't know if you want this Surly burn your capabilities

543
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Beforehand

544
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
Because

545
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:26,624
You know one of the things that happened in 2016 is Russia burned a lot of infrastructure

546
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,976
And they made everything a much harder Target like they went so overboard

547
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Public

548
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
What now

549
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
Everyone is aware of

550
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,608
If they haven't

551
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,144
1

552
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,936
Being so over-the-top

553
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,240
Then it's total being like Oh yeah right

554
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Russia

555
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
Come on

556
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Pull the other one

557
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,640
And I would have been able to do it again because no one would

558
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,944
Believe that that was a real

559
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,248
That was a real threat

560
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,064
Holyshit going to watch out

561
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,904
What are these Russians do that thing again now it's like bought bought bought

562
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Hysteria

563
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,280
Yeah yeah absolutely

564
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
It won't be bots in that way this

565
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
This time around that's one thing that I

566
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
Nike precaution against

567
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
In discussing

568
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
The people here because

569
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
What I'm saying I wanted to pass

570
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Houses by you

571
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,800
Is more

572
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
I believe there are at least

573
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Some

574
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
Woman nation-states were starting to look at

575
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
Sort of extreme inside

576
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,528
Of the internet

577
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,808
And trying to incite

578
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,392
Mistress of the entire social

579
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,672
The entire Society

580
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Of the United

581
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
Skate and create

582
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Violent

583
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,584
Like-like accelerationism

584
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:46,496
The whole thing is like if you look at qanon it's literally

585
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,080
Some assholes posting gibberish on one message board

586
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,920
It is formed this entire social Community made up of people who

587
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:54,944
Don't have

588
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
A community in that just joined in with us

589
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,320
They believe so the

590
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:05,696
Like you you look at their slogan where we go one we go all that's a huge thing about Community that's

591
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,280
It's almost there what would Jesus do

592
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,120
What song am I singing

593
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
Concept

594
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Is really strong for social Bond

595
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
End

596
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:22,080
You know the fact that these days the world

597
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,408
A trunk and that the distance between any two node

598
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,736
Is very very short because we roll online

599
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,320
So when they used to be very very long and we used to live in villages

600
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,624
You know the shortest path to your neighbor

601
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,184
So you tended to identify

602
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,256
You know the US was the village that you lived in

603
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,584
People that are new

604
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
V

605
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,632
Baker

606
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:49,472
And so on so you found things in common with them and that's what

607
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Hold you together

608
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,776
These days

609
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:56,896
You don't need to go just on Geographic locality it doesn't need to be

610
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
The Village

611
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
You can say or I

612
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,528
You know we are interested in chess

613
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,368
And chess is a global community so you can

614
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,952
Identify as a chess player and part of his chest

615
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:14,816
Environment and that could be the part of your identity that provides you with community

616
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
Obviously infosec

617
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,424
Mike infosec is our community that's

618
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
I will identify and that gives us a sense of

619
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,056
No belonging

620
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,616
We're still struggling with a you know

621
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:34,016
The US versus them I'm trying to be like this isn't the stupid developers that are putting bugs intentionally into their coat

622
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Stop

623
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,600
Thanks to this demonizing thing

624
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,392
But yeah I think

625
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:41,440
If you if you also look at

626
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,792
One of the things that people were very very worried about the domestic Warfare

627
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
Which

628
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,864
They talked about but which

629
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,192
The Russians didn't actually do like the Russians did straight up

630
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
Propaganda

631
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,752
I thought they were

632
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
What they were putting out

633
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,568
Waze

634
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,896
Literally you know like Rosie the Riveter we can do it

635
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,432
Is very much

636
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,480
Saying like you're one of us

637
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
Because you agree

638
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
With this other messaging

639
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,648
We're trying to get all those

640
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,560
I-10

641
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,144
That's the thing that you if you want to look at memetic Warfare look at

642
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,912
4chan

643
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,448
Look at Splash Pole look at

644
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,776
What is people who are doing

645
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,336
You know recruitment against

646
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
Young men

647
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,712
Old women

648
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,504
Getting involved in the alt right

649
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,600
You know and they're they're doing it by sound like

650
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,160
Here's something edgy and amusing and like

651
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,952
You can you cancel them

652
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,768
Say this but thank you don't like to why you like

653
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
Its a joke relax

654
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
Don't take it so seriously

655
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,912
That allows them to

656
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
Cat people

657
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,264
In an answer in a little bit you can get them

658
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,336
A little bit more in a little bit more eventually

659
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,128
You know that's your recruitment funnel

660
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:11,040
That's Tuff I think that's a real memetic Warfare that you want to look at you want to duplicate

661
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,856
How you're going to run

662
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:18,208
Are you going to do it the way that the

663
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
And Staffing

664
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
Very very impressed

665
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,352
How they've been able to go from

666
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,728
When was the last time that Nazis were a serious problem

667
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,312
10 years ago no one was going like we got to get the Nazis off Twitter

668
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,896
Like literally we have to get the Nazis off Twitter

669
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,272
You can blame that on memes I think

670
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,320
Make a solid argument

671
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,392
Down to memes I don't know if it's

672
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,696
True as like the only reason but

673
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
I think it's

674
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,536
Definitely a part of the reason

675
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
And um

676
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,168
And I think I think she was like you said there they're literate with

677
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,496
With our culture not our society because they're part of it

678
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
And

679
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,104
I think with some of the alt right is doing right now is there really tapping into

680
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,688
Some key things of young white men that are

681
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
Angry about

682
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,248
Creating

683
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Memes

684
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
Specifically

685
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
Before that I might give you look at

686
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,368
Have you seen like the hashtag honk

687
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,392
Can honk lyrics

688
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
And mahogany

689
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:25,280
It's about to die from the Yang Yang and all that it's it's it's really

690
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
Really scary

691
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:27,840
Propaganda

692
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,888
But it's getting a lot of play

693
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
You know

694
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
That's

695
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
That's

696
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
You know

697
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
The unsettled

698
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
So I think

699
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,432
One of the advantages that the other ultralight has

700
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,736
Right now over

701
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
I won't say the alt left

702
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,600
Is that

703
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,160
The alt-right is actually having fun

704
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
If you join the left

705
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,512
Does like I'm going to be super liberal

706
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,632
What happens is you have to police your speech to make sure you don't say something offencive

707
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:07,008
You have to make sure that you're like falling all of these rules stay on the inside

708
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:14,176
Where is if you join the right you can say whatever you want and you can piss on people and you can you know being an a******

709
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,480
And if you are 17 year old guy

710
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:21,600
And you're looking for what you want to do and it's going to be like well I want to be in the group that lets me like

711
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
Being an a****** and is going to encourage that

712
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:26,720
A group that gets upset

713
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,816
Because you know I'd I fail to recognize someone's non-binary gender

714
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
So I mean

715
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:38,496
To say anything about the left being bad on that sounds like it's

716
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,080
All great however it's not a wonderful recruiting tool saying

717
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
Join us

718
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,152
And stop having fun

719
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,176
Versus

720
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
Join us and

721
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,296
Json any one you like and we're going to think that's awesome

722
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,856
You know I like you can come be one of the lads

723
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,416
Write a minute which which fits into sort of like

724
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,208
Very typical

725
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,560
Youngboy masculine b******* where it's like you want to come here and egg houses

726
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
S*** on people and be angry

727
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,216
How to do it and if you on the other side there's

728
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
There's respect

729
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,032
Wood stairs

730
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:19,456
Yeah and I mean like long-term obviously as a society we don't want everyone shiting on it

731
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,832
And I like that's not how you build a civilization

732
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,904
Now it comes from respecting people and having and I like

733
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,464
Let's not treat everyone like s*** all the time

734
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,560
Clearly that's not what you want but on the other hand we don't have

735
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,352
A way where we could have like

736
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
Take

737
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,656
All of that

738
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,448
Aggression and energy answers

739
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
Siphon it off somewhere

740
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,384
You want to go and die for Allah

741
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:52,480
You want to go and Jihad Somewhere In Another Country far away from here

742
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
And get shot

743
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
Like rats

744
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
What do you mean at 7 to study government

745
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
Is it for years

746
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
It still does.

747
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:07,840
He sort of backfired a bit when you guys who didn't get shot came back now with several years of war experience and

748
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,400
Daddy of like yours how you get rid of government

749
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,240
And then Shannon and then proceeded to launch an attack against your

750
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
Kimo's

751
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,616
Check it outside that then sent the world into a decade-long

752
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
War

753
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:32,928
Local domestic policy

754
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,512
But you know the good with the bad

755
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,840
So I need

756
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,632
I can hear your dog scratching

757
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
So I don't want to

758
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,424
Kikiwaka

759
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
Any longer

760
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
But

761
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:47,008
You know do you think

762
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
Bus is prepare to die

763
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
Do you think the US

764
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
Absolutely no

765
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
As I said

766
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:57,248
The reason the US is not prepared is that the

767
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,064
The major stuff that work was the hacking League

768
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,416
The preparation that needs to be done is not so

769
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,232
Regulation requiring paper ballot

770
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
You know which would be great

771
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,352
It's not better algorithms of Facebook

772
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,144
Keep fake news from

773
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,192
Things Brad which again would be great

774
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,752
It's newsrooms going

775
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,872
The Russian intelligence is giving us an exclusive access to

776
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,152
These emails

777
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:29,760
Let's really think about what we want to publish them rather than

778
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,832
Publishing them as fast as we possibly can

779
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
B

780
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:40,256
The Domaine stuff is going to be like the media still has the biggest

781
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:45,120
You know they don't necessarily have as wide an audience as the social media does

782
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
They have a very very powerful Gates

783
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,728
Keeper and validation rule

784
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
And

785
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
If they're not exercising that

786
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
Then they

787
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,640
Are becoming validator

788
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
Anything that comes out

789
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,480
And they become the de facto

790
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784
Amplification arm

791
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,856
You know whichever intelligent service is

792
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Taken advantage of

793
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,928
End

794
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
People

795
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:14,048
Are there doing some sort of introspection

796
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,888
Well I mean at least we're not Facebook

797
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,544
I think because of that

798
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,848
You're going to see the same problem

799
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
The game

800
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
Because

801
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
Yeah as I said

802
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,992
Is immediate the one like

803
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:37,088
Yes social media had you know all of these things that were shared and

804
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,368
Massive exposure

805
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:43,744
But most of the stuff that was shared was you know Washington Post articles on New York Times articles

806
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,144
The big problem that too is that I think this is what's scary is I'm not sure

807
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,936
You know we as media

808
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,728
I have learned

809
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,264
So to speak is that

810
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,080
You during this whole mother reporting there were a lot of

811
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,360
A lot of problems

812
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
There was a lot of

813
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,968
It was pretty clear that I think that there was a select group

814
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,760
People are really did want to get

815
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
This collusion narrative down and it didn't

816
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,624
Now you have this hole

817
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,184
Set a rejection of what we've been reporting on in

818
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,976
Even you look at the idea of a

819
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,768
Obstruction of justice in that report

820
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,816
It's so overwhelming that's why

821
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
What happened it

822
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
Clear that there's

823
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:22,400
Unprecedented amount of

824
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,192
Corruption that went on

825
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,496
In the presidential Administration but

826
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
The people

827
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,360
Of United States are not as interested in listening to that narrative

828
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
Cuz

829
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
There's been this sort of

830
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
Full Sail

831
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:40,064
Attack on trying to make sure the collusion narrative worked and it didn't

832
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,136
Yeah and that's actually one of the

833
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
If you look at that

834
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,000
Would be an excellent example of

835
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,584
A Long play information Warfare thing where you can live

836
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:55,680
Trick the opposition into over-reaching

837
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,240
And then as soon as they've ever reached

838
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:02,592
You can go back and be like look because it didn't go all the way to 11

839
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:05,664
Then clearly saying it went to 10 is also bulshit

840
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:11,296
Warehouses in an hour to 10 and they try to say it went all the way to 11

841
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,344
And that wasn't the case but it

842
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Obviously

843
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
Because you can

844
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
Part of it

845
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,232
You can discredit all of it

846
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,816
And that's that's one of the reasons I don't like the term debunked

847
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
Because debunked

848
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,144
A very

849
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
Sweeping time

850
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,800
So I would see frequently in 2016 people are saying

851
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
You know

852
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,384
That article has been debunked

853
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,480
Can I be like a 2000 word article where one paragraph

854
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,856
How to have a correction with their like you know it wasn't Moldova it was you know

855
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
Montenegro

856
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:56,352
Like you know actually there's a small correction made because part of it was wrong but the rest of it is true you can't

857
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
Say

858
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,680
All of it is wrong just because part of it is wrong

859
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
That's actually one of those

860
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,080
Bias just like the fallacy bias

861
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,408
If an argument contains a fallacy

862
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,992
She believes that the entire argument is wrong itself

863
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
The fallacy

864
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,648
MSN

865
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,464
It's it's really shocking to see the level

866
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
Level political

867
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
Banks that should have been going back in

868
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Force on Mass

869
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Because

870
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,376
If you look at this even with with a k

871
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
Completely objective lens

872
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,216
Okay there that doesn't actually appear to be

873
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Occlusion

874
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,288
To that ignore the

875
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Haidian

876
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,080
Construction

877
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,128
Is going in the long term

878
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
Sweetly damage United States

879
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
Especially if you

880
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
You can't have a President Who

881
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:46,272
Who behaves that way and in his role

882
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,184
And you say that that's okay then you know what the hell is the point of having it at doj that separate or having a

883
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
Converse that

884
00:38:54,208 --> 00:39:00,352
Provide oversight you may as well just to let the king exactly and let him see how that goes yeah and it's and then you think yourself

885
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,632
Whatever

886
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,656
Russia with

887
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:03,680
Planning in 20s

888
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
16

889
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,752
You can't really say whether

890
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
Directly after

891
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
Back to the ballot or not

892
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
It's really impossible to come and get

893
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,872
Stat like that

894
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
That said

895
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,944
Whatever they were planning to do they tried

896
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
Defected something

897
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
And I think

898
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
Never in your wildest dreams

899
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,088
Would they have seen the level of the

900
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
Destruction

901
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:23,136
That has

902
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
Existential destruction

903
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
To the United States

904
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,304
I mean I'm pretty sure that

905
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,400
2017 Russia was having buyer's remorse

906
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:39,520
You know they're like in our weekly investor all of this to get Trump and we were supposed to get the sanctions removed

907
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
That didn't happen

908
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:46,176
Now we're supposed to get something done against Ukraine that didn't happen

909
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,736
I like they they weren't getting anything

910
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
Positive

911
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,856
It wasn't a positive return for them

912
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,648
You know that the status quo

913
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
Bots

914
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,464
What a

915
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,864
Have now gotten several years down the line is that the u.s. is tearing itself apart

916
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,656
Internally and so is NATO

917
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:10,240
Yeah and it's and it's similar to brexit

918
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,776
Like if you if you look at it

919
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
Brexit

920
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
Russian

921
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
Pretty sure was involved

922
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,920
I'm pushing. It hasn't been as

923
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
Widely delved into

924
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
But not the

925
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,320
If you wanted to take the UK

926
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,344
Out of

927
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,160
The running as a global power

928
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
And just live TV

929
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
Paralyzed

930
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
For several years

931
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,792
An ineffective and unable to do it

932
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
Anyting

933
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,120
Brexit has been a godsend

934
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
Not that they literally

935
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,448
I don't do

936
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
Anyting

937
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:46,336
They they they even managed to take the you know 20-year peace process in Northern Ireland that

938
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:48,640
My phone was very very happy for

939
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
And throw it out the window

940
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,760
And you know you know how people getting killed by the IRA

941
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:54,528
Which

942
00:40:54,784 --> 00:41:00,160
You know is these days that should be Unthinkable you know that's something from the 80s you know the early 90s

943
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,208
You know I shouldn't be

944
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,256
Coming back and get it is

945
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,816
Simile in the US you know

946
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:11,424
You could say yeah like Trump didn't lift sanctions

947
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:16,288
But the whole process of having Trump come in and how

948
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
Things are being sold

949
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,104
Corrupted internally

950
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:23,968
You're getting a huge win in taking the us out of the running as

951
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,272
A global power like I'm not able

952
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,808
To operate as effectively

953
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
And that's

954
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
Massive strain on natureware

955
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,696
The US is basically like

956
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:36,000
Be the shoulder that everyone lands on you

957
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,072
They were the main guy and everyone was sort of like

958
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
It's literally like it

959
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,264
It's the it's the wettest of Soviet Union dreams

960
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
Like it's crazy

961
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
Literally

962
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
How many years

963
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Now since

964
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,967
The following there funny things are looking up

965
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:02,367
All of this is amazing when you look at you no rush is basically it's a

966
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,695
Economy-wise it's a developing Nation

967
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:12,095
With a rusting nuclear Arsenal and pretty much it's smaller than Canada

968
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,631
Yeah like they've got

969
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,167
They they have

970
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:19,519
No GDP their life expectancy is plummeting

971
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,079
You know

972
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Yeah

973
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:25,407
Beijing population say they don't have

974
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:30,015
You know Innovative industries that are driving anything they're there a petrol can't be cold

975
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
Country

976
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,575
You know all of these

977
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,599
Things in your life

978
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
These guys are

979
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:37,439
In the real world they should be a nobody

980
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,255
They should be a Yemen

981
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
Okay well

982
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:46,399
Nice nice to have you onboard and everything you know

983
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,727
Enjoy the hors d'oeuvres and

984
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
Mingle

985
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,799
Not like it where they shouldn't be at the table

986
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
But sure they are and they've managed to become a Power broker

987
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,991
Power broker status

988
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
And they

989
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
Got this much larger than life

990
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,159
Emma just like you know this evil mastermind that's controlling

991
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,231
Everything I'm pulling strings and making all the stuff happen

992
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,279
And it's completely undeserved

993
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:23,007
