Package deal

4
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:29,184
Used to be the Presidents had to be like war heroes or at least serve

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,304
Gone to an Ivy League school and been in some weird sanctimonious Noble family of New England

Open 2020

7
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,912
We could be facing a much different type of pedigree

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,704
Hacker in Chief

9
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,776
Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke

10
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,312
The latest candidate

11
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,104
Enter the race for president

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,384
Of the United States

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,200
He's already one of the top contenders

14
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
The Democratic ticket

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,296
It will face off against Donald Trump

16
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,136
He also happens to be a member of one of the most OG

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,928
And most radical hacking groups

18
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
Of all

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
Time

20
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
The Cult of the dead cow

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,096
They were Anonymous before Anonymous stop pissing on the seat

00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,192
The well Sac before lulzsec got on his diapers and so on and so forth

23
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,008
Born online in the 80s in active

24
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
In to mm

25
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,872
The legendary group fought against government surveillance internet censorship

26
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,688
Expose widespread vulnerabilities

27
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
To the dismay of Corporation

28
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,344
I mean the CDC is known to have literally coined the term activist

29
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,928
Adecco 1998 released back orifice

30
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,280
Early version of a trojan horse exploiting Microsoft vulnerabilities

31
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,608
Allowing hackers to gain control of any system using Windows

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,656
Which attracted the interest of the

33
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
Yacht

34
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,240
At the time the group also claimed to have hacked into the system

35
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
TIAA

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,616
Last week Reuters revealed that Beto O'Rourke

37
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,920
Whitney early member of the group back in the eighties

38
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
And going by the handle

39
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,480
Psychedelic

41
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,552
We're here today to talk to Oxblood

42
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,112
Longtime and influential member

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
Blue Beto's Secret

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
Before

45
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
It was revealed

46
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
World

47
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,768
Explain the Godfather Packers

48
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Sat down with us

49
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
Bado

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
CDC

51
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:48,192
I've been Mac who this is cyber

52
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,592
No news has it been 4

53
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
CDC San Simeon

54
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
News the biggest news

55
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
To bring you back in the map in a long time

56
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
I mean it was

57
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,064
We knew it was coming

58
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
Because

59
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
We've been speaking with

60
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,488
Patrolman the author of the book on the CDC

61
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,816
And a better was part of that book

62
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:21,472
So we knew it was coming and people were thinking of well it's is going to be in trucking we were actually much more focused on

63
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,848
We just started figured out okay there's going to be some residual interest but

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
Just like say on social media

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,344
I think my name got Associated somehow with one of the early tweets about the announcement and the next

66
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,232
250 new followers nothing my God what is this

67
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:47,072
It's just kind of crazy but

68
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,912
I think I'll of course we're going to get more attention and

69
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
A lot of people

70
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,520
He sort of grew up with the CDC

71
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:59,360
And we've been through because the group's been around so long I mean

72
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,712
Started in 1984 so been around for a thousand years

73
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:10,368
At this point liking in the internet here is yeah

74
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:19,071
Yeah I think it's because we've gone through a number of iterations there with BBs days and then

75
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:24,703
The early web days and then there was the releasing

76
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,007
Back orifice

77
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,567
Activism after that sand

78
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,615
Revenge Shirley quieten

79
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,663
It mostly because you know

80
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,199
People have

81
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,247
Jobs mortgage payments

82
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
Kids

83
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:44,159
We've been doing a lot more work but again the group is

84
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,719
I mean active in the sense

85
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
Instead

86
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
We're still very much connected to

87
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,399
Either you know startup some people working

88
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:59,519
Government some people work for military contractors it's

89
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:04,383
Is pretty broad the Spectrum to the CDC grew up

90
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,199
Am I being clear it's

91
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
The Cult

92
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,247
Of the dead cow

93
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,319
Exactly did I die

94
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
It's kind of funny that everybody

95
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,719
Who hasn't heard of the group before they hear a CDC and they're confused

96
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,327
The Center for Disease Control like what it what are those guys doing on the internet

97
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Yes it is the CDC

98
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,215
And

99
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Going to be fun

100
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,567
Moving forward especially

101
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,639
Sing the kind of reactions that Beto gets

102
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,479
And you started in in 1984 in Texas

103
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,015
Sister named after a slaughterhouse

104
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,647
A peek at that Dusty files that are online which I'm sure the traffic on those

105
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
Change completely over the last

106
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,023
Over the last five days

107
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
You know you got a real sense

108
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
Sort of like this

109
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,655
Old school

110
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,935
Hacker group

111
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
You know you say a lot of outrageous

112
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Shet

113
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Anarchic

114
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
And you'll have that start

115
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
Originally it was just a

116
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,663
Very small group

117
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
People

118
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,503
Just like a couple of local guys from

119
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,783
Lubbock Texas

120
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
And then

121
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,415
The BBS scene was just sort of taking off and

122
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
Mostly it was

123
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Young guy

124
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
Teenage boys

125
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
And

126
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
At the time I mean

127
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
Access to

128
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Two computers friend

129
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,263
Was more or less limited to

130
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:40,383
Kids who had some cut usually who had some kind of connection

131
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
2

132
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:45,759
University Town signals to the early

133
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,319
HotPads for like say

134
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
Boston

135
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,927
San Francisco

136
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:58,047
Houston University towns with

137
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Computer science department

138
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,655
Like every other guy I know

139
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,983
Who started at that time usually a parent

140
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
Worked in Tech

141
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
Or

142
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
The mask

143
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Department of some University

144
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
So they tended to be

145
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
Middle class

146
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Young

147
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
Men boys

148
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,551
In University Town

149
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
And then

150
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
That was kind of the

151
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,463
I don't know that that's exactly the structure of it but

152
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,791
You know where these things were starting up

153
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,071
And then from that

154
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,983
Bulletin boards for just kind of popping up all over the place and that was really

155
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,567
The beginning of the scene and so the

156
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
The CDC

157
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
Should have hooked up with

158
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
A bunch of

159
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
The board said they had an affinity within the group sort of came from that and the reputation

160
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
For the group spread

161
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,231
In the early days to those a bulletin board

162
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
I thirst for you provide milk from my balls love it

163
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:14,335
Good gorgeous but those that do love me or leave me

164
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Beat

165
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
How has rhythm

166
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,015
Wax my ass rub my balls

167
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,063
The cow has risen

168
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:28,159
Provide the Psychedelic warlord with with potatoes handle

169
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
And you know

170
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
He wrote some pretty outrageous stories

171
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
One of them being

172
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,095
Basically something that was like a murder fan

173
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
ICU

174
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
I'm running down to

175
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Two kids in his car and killing

176
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
Who is Extreme

177
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
I mean but again I'm not going to

178
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
I'm not going to

179
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
Fault someone for something they wrote when they were a kid

180
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,991
Yeah I mean I think that particular story is like

181
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:59,391
Kind of bad Stephen King writing and I wouldn't be surprised if he would be reading this kind of stuff himself

182
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
Is really voracious reader

183
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,815
Plus the fact that young guy as you noted and

184
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:12,447
It was more lesson keeping with the the tenor of the chief I'll collection

185
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
Everybody was trying to sort of

186
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
Be outrageous and test boundaries

187
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
One of the

188
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,895
The first files

189
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,479
Auntie Monroe underground which was the BBS set

190
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
A swamp rat

191
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,831
Or Grandmaster rat is he is now called

192
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,415
Who started the CDC is called a gerbil feed bomb

193
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
And it's

194
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
Crazy annie's

195
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
It's

196
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
I think it's hilarious

197
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,607
Still one of my my favorite Chief I'll spend

198
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,655
Definitely you know

199
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Young Smart

200
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,543
Guys who can type fast and are trying to compete about

201
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,847
Who can be the most outrageous

202
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
Or

203
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,967
Just the sort of test what you can get away with online

204
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:01,087
I think it's kind of like you know the more outrageous you could be the more attention you might get

205
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,671
And the greater the reputation you might have in the group so

206
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,023
I think things were very competitive under a lot of young elf males in the group

207
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,375
And quite frankly there's

208
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,471
It's just that we be grown up and and write better than we used to

209
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,287
Yeah I mean it's also just seems like it's very much so

210
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
Like a lot of

211
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
OG packing

212
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Especially in that.

213
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,455
Shantrell each other

214
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
You know

215
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Do as much as

216
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,527
You can just order

217
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Buick split

218
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,087
It is possible

219
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,903
You may not always mean what you say or what you

220
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,671
You do you're just

221
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
Doing it to

222
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,999
Frankly just to f*** with

223
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
Agree

224
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,167
Especially at that time

225
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
With the age of the kids and kind of

226
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,335
The direction to tpal groups for moving in

227
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:58,175
It was a big competition that is sort of gross-out party

228
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Idyllwild

229
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
Really was done tongue and cheek

230
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,599
I never liked it the first time

231
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
I came across

232
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,951
The CDC in a bunch of these other groups

233
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
I spend a

234
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:16,607
Ton of Time online reading all of these files and some were just horrible in

235
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,727
You could tell they were bitten by people couldn't especially right well

236
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,871
It is kind of silly in a certain way and then I kept coming across the

237
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
CDs out of the text files that were

238
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,527
We're coming out of the CDC and I thought

239
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:38,367
It's something about them I couldn't quite put my finger on

240
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:45,791
I always thought there was something a little deeper going on below the surface and it reminded me of a comment that

241
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:51,423
Who wrote this but there was some kind of profile in the New Yorker

242
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
About David Letterman

243
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,591
And the phrase I remember was said he's the king of knowing silliness

244
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,639
Now you can say

245
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,943
Ridiculous things

246
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,271
Tonya you couldn't figure out why they were funny but then

247
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,599
After awhile you realize I was actually a little bit deeper

248
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Everything not to

249
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,999
Overthink this too much

250
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:20,351
You know something I kind of picked up on from the CDC that

251
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:23,167
Of course silly on top

252
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,447
I have the feeling that

253
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,567
The people associated with the group were doing really interesting and different things so

254
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
That's What attracted me to do

255
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
ICDC in the first

256
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
Tell me about Beto and what

257
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
His involvement

258
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Was

259
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Initially

260
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,599
So he was Huey psychedelic Warlord

261
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
Yeah I mean I maybe not

262
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,951
Best person to ask

263
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,535
Because I wasn't associated with the group at that time but from

264
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
From what I've heard

265
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,679
He started a board called Taco land

266
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,495
Which was I believe named after

267
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:01,055
A song from the Dead Milkmen

268
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,175
And at that time I think it's also interesting like

269
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,759
Roughly 1908 1984 when the

270
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,831
CDC was started and there were other

271
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,111
Roots

272
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,903
Around

273
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,999
The holster the punk ass hoes was a huge

274
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Thanks

275
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,119
I know that punk really influence

276
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,703
A lot of the guys very early members

277
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
Of the CDC

278
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,311
Adjust the added to do it yourself

279
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,943
Andy institution Andy organization

280
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,295
This this whole kind of spirit of

281
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
Breaking out starting a new way

282
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
Kind of rebellion

283
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Against a friend

284
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
Forms weather is like

285
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
No government through politics

286
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,887
Baby

287
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Rihanna

288
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
Business this kind of thing

289
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
It was

290
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,335
And that also was very much

291
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,943
Certain part of that scene in the sense that he was definitely

292
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,783
Influence that sell young teen by punk music and then

293
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,111
Got his own thing going on I just think that

294
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
As a result of that she made

295
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
Connections with

296
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,511
Like-minded people in that singing

297
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
And then he stayed within the orbit

298
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
Of the CDC for a while

299
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
Yeah

300
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,751
I think he was active as far as I know he was active for both

301
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
For five years

302
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
And then

303
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,919
When he was I think it was about 18 he went to

304
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
You move to

305
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,783
New York P was going to Columbia University I think he's studied English

306
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,319
So

307
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:52,927
She was in New York and there were a couple of people like their number of

308
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Assertive

309
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
Hacker groups

310
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Then

311
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,679
More or less located or a lot of the members located in New York there is like

312
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,567
Legion of the underground and masters of deception and probably a couple of other groups

313
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
So there is definitely a scene in people would have known each other

314
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,247
And a couple of the CDC guys were in New York and of course

315
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,551
There's the

316
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,111
Hackers on planet Earth convention

317
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,719
That happens I think it's every two years in New York so

318
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,511
Etta would have pain

319
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
Definitely in and around that

320
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Altruis University days

321
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,703
And if you worked in some kind of bias

322
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,007
Speed during that time

323
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,871
As far as I recall I went to a party

324
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,407
What's that

325
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,735
He would have been there I mean is definitely at the same party

326
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,855
I'm sure I would have met him because there aren't a lot of people but I don't really distinctly remember meeting

327
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,463
Somebody posted a picture the other day of the same party and

328
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,511
I recognized everybody and I

329
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,839
I thought I kind of recognize bad O2 because

330
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:10,495
He stood out a little bit because everybody was kind of like blue hair or black t-shirts are y'all dirty punky

331
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,543
And he's kind of look

332
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
Barry J crew

333
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
Yankees always being

334
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,295
A kind of different guy and also I mean one of the interesting things about the cult of the dead cow

335
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
It's not what you would call your

336
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Typical hacker group

337
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,207
Like people come from

338
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
Meaning of course there are

339
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,279
People with huge

340
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,839
Security in Computing skills

341
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,887
And they're also

342
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,703
You know the number of people who get all their

343
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
On computers and they work

344
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,055
UNO online

345
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
And we got a Wacom

346
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
PhD

347
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
One guy was

348
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,735
Former assistant district attorney

349
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,271
Another warmer

350
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,111
Some College University professors

351
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:05,023
And one guy who passed away sadly a few years ago was a former contractor with the CIA

352
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
And you know

353
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
Duckling read that

354
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,983
People in the CDC we're kind of

355
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:14,751
Keeping this

356
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
Secret while Beto

357
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
Rose the ranks

358
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
Why was there an interest in keeping this

359
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
The secret that he was a member of

360
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,991
Well I think the true reasons first

361
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
We realize that

362
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
His association with a group

363
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
What could cause him

364
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
Either

365
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:37,279
Male some embarrassment or opening him up to attacks together thing and actually that

366
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,583
More important reason is that

367
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
People are in the CDC you're having

368
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
Everybody is used to handle

369
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:51,103
Basically Ruland and people with handles that we just don't disclose

370
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,943
You know who is in the group we don't attach a handle to a name

371
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,735
It's different

372
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
If

373
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,599
Somebody else themselves and they say okay I used to be a member

374
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
My name is whatever in this was my

375
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
Formal handle that's fine

376
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:11,327
They chose to do that so you know people can talk about it or not talk about it

377
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,655
It's just been our policy that we don't

378
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:18,239
Y'all talk about who the members are we don't put names to handles

379
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,311
Do you actually interact with a bunch of these

380
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
These members

381
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,919
Almost all of the members eyemed

382
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:31,295
I'm pretty sure I do know their names but fairly often we just refer to each other by handles

383
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:38,207
I'm definitely like when we're in public if we're at like some kind of conference everybody is introduced by there and Allure

384
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:42,303
We refer to each other by Handel's it's just kind of

385
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
A protocol

386
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,911
But I think there are like some people

387
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:53,567
I know that I I've heard their real names but it's just that I keep forgetting them because I identify with them

388
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
Much more by the handle

389
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Do you agree that

390
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,455
The Cult of the dead cow is sort of this

391
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,807
Precursor to anonymous mean you know a lot of people say you coined the term active

392
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,439
We were definitely the first group to use the term online

393
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
We

394
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,023
Decided

395
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,351
And it was something that we wanted to work in

396
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,167
And in some ways you can say that

397
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:24,799
The CDC and Anonymous have sort of structural similarities be started out as

398
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
Sort of fun

399
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,407
You know media pranking groups

400
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,759
You can say that we weren't that serious in the beginning

401
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
We were just about

402
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,415
Having fun in publishing text files and Anonymous was

403
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
Doing whatever they were doing

404
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
You know on 4chan

405
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,375
And then at a certain point

406
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
Anonymous

407
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,031
I decided to go public in a certain way and I think it was Project

408
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,567
Chanala G

409
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
Which was the

410
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,687
Anti-scientology campaign that they started

411
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
So

412
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,271
They started being more active

413
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
And showing up

414
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,879
NBA kind of physical presence in the streets and

415
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
Doing that kind of thing so

416
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
It actually created a huge

417
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
Rake in the group

418
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
Dad

419
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,351
People who were the original sort of anonymous people

420
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,143
4chan

421
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,935
Just like Furious Sunday

422
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
We're calling all of today

423
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,335
The people who are doing assertive hacktivists style and painting

424
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,407
They started referring to the most immoral f***

425
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
The insult

426
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
Was not the f**

427
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,111
Army for using bad language

428
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,927
It was the insult was moral

429
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,535
That they were doing something that was like who needs that you know it's

430
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
Stupid

431
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,423
You know you're ruining the reputation of the group by becoming so serious

432
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,799
That was kind of the the anonymous side of things and the split in that group

433
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,103
And then

434
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,199
Back I guess it was 1999

435
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:12,063
We started officially started working and hacktivism and there wasn't like

436
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:17,952
A split in our group I mean it wasn't you like people weren't outraged within the cult of the dead cow

437
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
Actually

438
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,816
Pretty much everybody thought it was really cool and was quite supportive

439
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:27,168
I think it was much more outside the group that we got some criticism

440
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,264
No lots of people think that I ruined the CDC because

441
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,080
Started bleeding

442
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
Serious

443
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,688
Evolution of the group it's just that

444
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,992
You know we figured that

445
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,784
You know we're interested

446
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,552
In

447
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,856
You know helping people who were

448
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,952
Living behind National firewalls to get on the net

449
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,536
We started developing circumvention tools and

450
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
It was never to do anything then to help people get access to the net we weren't we didn't have a specific agenda

451
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,568
You know we want you to you know do whatever it's just get online

452
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,152
See whatever is on the internet and then do whatever you like

453
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,456
So

454
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,808
There are some similarities in terms of say the way

455
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,392
But what's a cult of the dead cow an anonymous got started

456
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,976
And there was a sort of evolution

457
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
In the group

458
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,584
Hell yeah I guess

459
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
I mean some people have said that the

460
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:34,240
Anonymous couldn't exist without the CDC in a way

461
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,592
That may or may not be true I'm not sure I have a

462
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,664
Complete opinion on that

463
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,480
Similarities with the groups and

464
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,040
Topeka quite honest I mean

465
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
I was really impressed by

466
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,952
Some of the stuff that Anonymous did especially during the Arab Spring

467
00:22:54,464 --> 00:23:00,608
Valuable work and they should be respected for that I mean the groups within Anonymous that did that of course

468
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Wasn't

469
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,960
The group is all I'm in their number of cells doing different offs

470
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
How is it that

471
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,128
Did the CDC went from like this

472
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
She file sharing

473
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
Group

474
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
2

475
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
You know the group that

476
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
Dropped black worth

477
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
99

478
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
Essentially kind of Harold in this

479
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
List. Of hacked

480
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:29,792
We started 84 and then I guess it was like around 92 or so

481
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
When the web

482
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
Weather Cutler

483
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,496
It was kind of like the shadow CDC was back in the

484
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
Yoobi Bi-State

485
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,152
And it was also a very kind of marginal thing like

486
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,968
Really not that many people

487
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,832
Where in the freaking CNN that have computers and word

488
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
Dialing into

489
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,416
Bulletin board systems

490
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,512
So it was definitely a certain time

491
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,560
And a certain community

492
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,144
Particular a song

493
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,216
By the time the web came round I mean the

494
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,544
The core group in the CDC was there and

495
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,848
There was a bit of a revolving door

496
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
Echoing on the

497
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
People sorted

498
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,736
Came and went in there

499
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,784
Sort of new Evolution of the group

500
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,088
Southern a bunch of new people

501
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
And

502
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
We were

503
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,208
Getting used to being on the web

504
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,560
And I think also a lot of thought

505
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,888
That you know it's time to do something new

506
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,008
What can we get involved in at the time Microsoft

507
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:49,408
Was like it was a huge operating system but absolutely the worst for security

508
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,040
Kind of the enemy of the hacking community

509
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,832
Gary change company now that takes

510
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Security

511
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,624
Seriously

512
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:03,744
Patak's and like 97 98 99 in there

513
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,024
It was just

514
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Joke

515
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:10,912
As far as those security was concerned so we decided that we would point that out and

516
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,752
It was a combination of putting together some really

517
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,288
Incredible soft

518
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,408
And then having a sort of media operation

519
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,456
So it's like we were our own

520
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Sort of

521
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,832
Software company NPR age

522
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:38,304
It just sort of caught everybody's imagination and it was a big alternative party

523
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,936
We turned into a bunch of sort of Internet rock stars

524
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,752
It was a very different

525
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,032
Internet then

526
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:52,640
I was supposed to know there wasn't really it wasn't a social media Intranet

527
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
So things have changed

528
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,272
There's lots of mainstreaming

529
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
A lot more surveillance

530
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
That was fun

531
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:09,536
Yeah it was basically an evolution of coming from a sort of

532
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,840
Very much an underground scene

533
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,376
Into the mainstream

534
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
And I guess that was really the big difference

535
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
Okay so

536
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
We fast forward now

537
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
The 20/20

538
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Presidential alert

539
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,128
Beto O'Rourke

540
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,688
Some say the leading candidate now for the Democrats

541
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
We could

542
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,760
Ostensibly

543
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,064
Have the first president

544
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Who wives

545
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
Part of a hacker

546
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
Being a member of that group yourself

547
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,024
And seeing what's happened with The Cult of the dead cow

548
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,584
With Anonymous and then seeing that

549
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,144
I mean does that blow your mind a little bit

550
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:52,800
So is I mean it's it's definitely interesting and I think in many ways inevitable

551
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,896
I really think the most interesting thing is that

552
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,456
With somebody like Beto or

553
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,736
Or candidate

554
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,296
Or a person of his age and experience

555
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,672
The way everything is going I mean everything is digital

556
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,256
There are things like cyberwar and

557
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,816
Election tampering and all kinds

558
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,096
Things going on

559
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,912
Online I think most people

560
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
Knowing where

561
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,800
Society and politics is going Winfield Dairy comfortable

562
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,360
With somebody who is comfortable in that world

563
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
And especially

564
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,432
You know it

565
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,760
If you have those kind of long-standing connection

566
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:40,160
Yeah like you know what security is and you you know how you can get

567
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,720
The best advice about how to

568
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,120
Pretty much do anything online than that I think it's an f+ I think it's fantastic

569
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:53,984
I think the the only assertive tricky bid if we're talking about Beto

570
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
Is

571
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:00,384
Opposition research and people trying to slam and smear the guy

572
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,944
First Step he did when he was like

573
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,760
14 15 16 years old

574
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,088
But I think also something that's interesting

575
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
Barack Obama was the first

576
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,488
President and presidential candidate to

577
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:17,280
Smoke pot

578
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,608
At the time he did that

579
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
People talk that's no big deal

580
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:29,312
And it was kind of a nothingburger for a lot of people and it wasn't a talking point after that okay

581
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
The country doesn't care

582
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,408
I like I kind of think we're cute

583
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
Approaching.

584
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
20

585
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,224
With

586
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,528
Beto and in Canada

587
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:45,440
People talk about you know when I was 14 I did a little hacking and I did some phone freaking

588
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,304
I'm not proud of what I wrote but you know I learned a lot

589
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,656
I know how the internet works now and stuff like that

590
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
I think the

591
00:28:56,192 --> 00:29:01,056
It's really like I don't really believe this whole sort of better ways hackers story

592
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:05,408
You know in a couple of weeks I just don't think it's going to have much resonance

593
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,456
I need as as an attack

594
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,016
No I don't actually think it's going to help

595
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,808
I mean he's like his here's the thing is

596
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:16,160
It's very clear that Donald Trump has a very limited understanding of how the internet works

597
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
Besides

598
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,720
Twitter and even then

599
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
I'm not

600
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Kosher

601
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,816
But

602
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,936
And that's interesting because other than Obama I don't think there's ever been a president

603
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,472
Who actually understands the

604
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
The internet

605
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
In a way that

606
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,336
Younger people or Internet specialist

607
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
Do

608
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,968
And I think that that is going to be interesting to see how he wields that if

609
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,504
He makes it out of that

610
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,528
Democratic

611
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,296
Cool Canada

612
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:48,928
I mean I think it's definitely a generational thing like the older the candidate

613
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
More than likely

614
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
Less they know about

615
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,096
The internet being online the digital all of this stuff

616
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:01,984
Generally speaking the younger people are then the more they understand

617
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:09,152
A teenager when he got his first computer

618
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
So you know when you have a goat

619
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:16,064
30 + years of experience online and with computers you're going to know a fair bit

620
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:22,208
Are you somebody like trump it is actually a perfect example I mean he doesn't even use he doesn't have email

621
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
Is never used email

622
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:29,376
And although he's on Twitter I mean I think he just understands it as a vanity platform

623
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
Eddie knows that

624
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,496
A lot of people he can cut through

625
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,568
News and his tweets become the news

626
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,920
It is himself as a kind of

627
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
140

628
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
40 character

629
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Publisher

630
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,600
So you can get away with a lot and

631
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:52,928
His bully pulpit is used to bully people

632
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,744
I think people

633
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,024
Like this

634
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,608
Beto candidates like him of his age and experience

635
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,168
You're definitely the future

636
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,984
And I think increasingly

637
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:10,336
People will trust them to make the right decisions and feel comfortable

638
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:15,712
That they know where a society and technology is going and maybe even going to help

639
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,040
Paper way to the Future where these things are going

640
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,856
5G is coming up next year

641
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,672
That's going to be a huge deal it's already a

642
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,280
Certain political deal with the white house trying to

643
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,096
Hammering away at Huawei and

644
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
And influenza

645
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,680
Policy decisions in different countries

646
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,240
Who is going to deploy

647
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,360
These Technologies and what vendors are going to use so

648
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,688
If something is only going to get bigger

649
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,248
And we want people to understand

650
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
I mean look at it

651
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
They can be the first

652
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
Cracker and cheese

653
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:57,952
Actually this is very interesting thing and maybe a contrast about

654
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
Say the current Administration and whatever the next

655
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,096
There's no sort of cybersecurity czar

656
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,912
Other than I think maybe Rudy Giuliani mites

657
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,728
I have some kind of title

658
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:16,128
Be somebody like Julia he knows absolutely nothing about the internet I mean next to nothing

659
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
And

660
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,504
But the kind of people we need in those positions

661
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,808
You know the kind of people

662
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:27,648
Either work for the military or the NSA or

663
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,184
Some kind of

664
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:34,048
Computer handheld technical genius I mean these are the kinds of people

665
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,936
You want filling these positions and none of them are there in this current Administration and

666
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:46,336
Moving forward I think that's something that will definitely be seeing and could even be a campaign issue

667
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,104
Another

668
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,176
Well thank you for telling me about

669
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
The possible neck

670
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
Hacker

671
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,272
President and chief

672
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,552
Ever going to have

673
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,696
And forgiveness little school old school knowledge on one of the founding communities of

674
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
Hackers

675
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,256
You really going to be in a book

676
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,048
What mean you are in a book but

677
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
Sims 4 weird light

678
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Historical moment

679
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,008
DIY Dino that romance book is sort of on the

680
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:20,128
History answer the participants' the revolving door of the CDC in

681
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:23,200
Where the group came from and where it's going to

682
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:30,112
I think it's it's going to be very interesting I'm not exactly sure what is going to be in this book

683
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:35,744
I think it's going to be a good reader intro man is a serious writer

684
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,864
And she's done some other good stuff

685
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,912
Master phenomenon

686
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,240
He's the right kind of person

687
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,568
To do this kind of book and I think we're all looking forward to it

688
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Me too

689
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,872
