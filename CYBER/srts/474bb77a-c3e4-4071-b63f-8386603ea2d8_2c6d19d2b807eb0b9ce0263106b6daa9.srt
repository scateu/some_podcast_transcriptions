00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Eagle one package being delivered today of a company that all started with

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
Millions in CIA funding its top clients are the many alphabet agencies comprising the American intelligence

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
Industrial complex gallivanting conservative billionaire founder connected to President Trump

4
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,752
Basically your private spyware dealer

5
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,080
Hawkins surveillance software to the US government

6
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
You probably haven't heard of it but it's name is palantir

7
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
Actually use palantir to do evil things

8
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,280
Apart Parts these Technologies new technologies are are never intrinsically good and

9
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,680
Lately motherboard reporter Carolyn Haskins expose the disturbing Big Brother powers of their top secret

10
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,520
I'm Bandicoot and this

11
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
Decipher

12
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
Let's start from the very beginning

13
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Okay

14
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,736
What is palantir and how did it be

15
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:32,416
Right so pounds here is basically a big data aggregation company and it specializes in

16
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,256
Data from all different types of databases

17
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
Companies

18
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,048
Etc

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,864
And working for a really big client they can

20
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,168
Mesh all of this information together

21
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:48,288
And make it actionable and find Connections in a way that an individual human probably wouldn't be

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Baidu

23
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,640
So it's been sort of a favorite Organization for

24
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,224
Big government agencies law enforcement

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Branches of the Department of

26
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
Homeland Security

27
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,368
Branches of the Army and the military

28
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,440
Anything that's dealing with Intelligence on a Mac

29
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,488
Scale has Power Ranger on the radar

30
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,304
So it's an effect this is sort of a private Spike

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,328
Company in in many ways

32
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
Private spies

33
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,472
It's a good way of putting it I think it's worth noting that

34
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
There

35
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:22,592
County organizes information that other people already have

36
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,152
You know so it's not like palantir is

37
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
Ended up itself

38
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Like

39
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
Taking data from like

40
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,320
Crime records arrest records

41
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
Public records

42
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,880
Other types of

43
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Sources

44
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,696
The organizing and combining it

45
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,464
If that makes

46
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
I need information ended up

47
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:44,608
Itself is useless unless you can do something with it if it's not organized then

48
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:49,472
Anyone who wants to take advantage of it in any kind of way is going to be able to do that so that's where I found her come

49
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,056
There were talking about spy Networks

50
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,336
Spice in general

51
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
I mean information

52
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,640
Power

53
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Right it's the

54
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
Houser How big intelligence agency

55
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
C-3PO to

56
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Find

57
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,064
Ways of seeing population

58
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,880
Ways of seeing your enemies because they can

59
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
Quantify

60
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
And analyze data

61
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,256
Yeah like if you can break down

62
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,072
An individual a suspect that you're interested in

63
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,376
And the hundreds of different little data points

64
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
You're getting a much

65
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
Different picture of how to approach that you know

66
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
Tell me about Peter Thiel the founder

67
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,128
Yeah so he was

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,224
The founder of one of the early investors I mean you might know him from

69
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,040
The Gawker lawsuit you might know him from

70
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,880
Funding different types of Ventures throughout the years I think

71
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,952
Remember that Island story where he wanted the funds

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
Island basically you

73
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,584
Kind of this weird bonvillain desk character

74
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,192
That's probably the most efficient way to describe him

75
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,496
Gunning for who's the more Bonville and ask

76
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,288
Person on planet Earth

77
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Yeah yeah

78
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,408
And of course he's known for having sources

79
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
You know

80
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
Right political associate

81
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
Directing his MBA

82
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
Ways that reflect

83
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,648
Now the beginning a palantir one thing that always caught my attention was

84
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
It was a pain

85
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
Early

86
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:14,976
Recipient

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
Gif

88
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Yeah

89
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Yeah

90
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
I think it's a good example of

91
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:26,495
If you're like a company in your early stages in your able to get a government contract I can really

92
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,031
Float you through those septic

93
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:28,799
Polaris

94
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,871
Bring me to a level that you might not be able to otherwise

95
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,991
I've been busy with your stupid ascribing is this company has had deep connections to

96
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
Intelligence agencies in the United States

97
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,831
They do actually contract with

98
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,647
The FBI the CIA DHS

99
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,511
Special forces that they have in the path of the Desert from the premium

100
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,535
Law enforcement

101
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,839
And defense contracts in the entire world

102
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
Right yeah and it's interesting because so obviously palantir isn't the only company that these intelligence Asian

103
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
These are giving

104
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,847
Big money contracts to but especially when it's combined with

105
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
Other types of contracts with

106
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
I don't know for instance like

107
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
Thomson Reuters

108
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
Beer which is just basically another

109
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
Policing law enforcement School

110
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,623
Can be combined with credit Paul which is like

111
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,463
A predictive policing school which is sort of been criticized for

112
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
Sort of

113
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:25,119
Broken Window style policing perpetuating that style of policing

114
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:30,239
I'm so the danger here isn't even Justin talents your itself it's the way that it can be combined

115
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,079
Using multiplied with every other contract that the government has

116
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,687
And this is a company that was like originally exposed in 2010 by

117
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,223
Anonymous hackers

118
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,551
Visit has been floating around for years

119
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Now

120
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
You got to scoop ritas

121
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
Something was doing with the police

122
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,719
How do you get it

123
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
Right so

124
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
I was sort of interested in palantir is relationship

125
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,911
West law enforcement agencies around the country so I filed

126
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,751
Over a hundred I don't know the final tally just

127
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,871
Public information request with local police departments around the country to see if they had any kinds of

128
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,919
Contractor correspondence

129
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
With palantir

130
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,783
And almost all of them came up empty except for Palo Alto

131
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,575
And Palo Alto mentioned

132
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,927
Do the Northern California regional Intelligence Center

133
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,487
They had access to palantir

134
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
Software

135
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
So then obviously I filed

136
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:26,815
Another

137
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
Public records request.

138
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,703
I called the ncric I was told recently that is called Nick Rick

139
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,567
I guess I'll just call it neck Rec but anyway when I followed it to Negra

140
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
I guess that's when I got back

141
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,199
Over a dozen documents that really shed light on

142
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
The relationship between

143
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
I was here and then and

144
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
What came back included

145
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,855
A user manual which

146
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,695
Filled with dragon was very difficult to parse but

147
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,767
If you started just go through it carefully it gives you

148
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,607
A decent amount of insight into how it works on a practical level

149
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
And I also got payment records and such which

150
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471
Indicate that

151
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:11,871
Over 300 cities and 14 counties or able to get access to palantir through this Regional ontology

152
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
Concentre what's

153
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:17,759
Sometimes called a fusion Center because basically its role is to take data

154
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,575
From tons of different sources both public

155
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,599
And private

156
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,439
And to combine them to work on special types of Investigations

157
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,999
But what's interesting about the ncric is that

158
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
Local police departments can say

159
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:35,679
We're working on this case and we need power and fear in order to solve that so it can be used to

160
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
I dress pretty much any type

161
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
The crime that you can think of

162
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,799
Sweet describing then

163
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,359
Is piece of software that

164
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Police officer

165
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
Can type into a database

166
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Namor

167
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
License plate

168
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:49,247
Naked Zen

169
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,135
Put together all of the vectors of information across public records

170
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
And

171
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
Federal state records

172
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
Municipal records

173
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,559
Start to paint a picture of an individual even if that person is not

174
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
Guilty of a crime

175
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,399
Right so basically

176
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
I don't really get into detail about like

177
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:13,311
The subpoena process I mean in terms of like the automatic License Plate Reader

178
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,615
So that's kind of a big feature

179
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,711
That's highlighted in the user manual you do have to enter a case number

180
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
People search you have to

181
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
To put in

182
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
A reason for doing the search

183
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,927
And whether that person is innocent or guilty or not

184
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
I don't really get into that in the article

185
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
But

186
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,327
It seems intuitively that there's ways that this

187
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Potentially be abused

188
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
The fact that the

189
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,935
Search field is kind of an open field

190
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
But

191
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,799
I think it's worth highlighting here is just with your power of the tool

192
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
And the fact that you're able to get

193
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
I mean not even just

194
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,919
Name address

195
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
Gender or sex

196
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
And that kind of thing you can get

197
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
Email

198
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:01,183
Bank account information anything that's included on your license like height weight eye color

199
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,535
And if you're combining that with data from the automatic License Plate Reader

200
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
You can see your travel history

201
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,631
Because if you're associated

202
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,423
With a particular license plate

203
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
And

204
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983
They've been able

205
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:18,847
To capture that at say like a toll booth or something you take a picture of a license plate

206
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,199
To that so you just type in the license plate number

207
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
You can see where you've been

208
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,015
And when

209
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
Because the location in the timestamp they're both locked

210
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
So

211
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,903
Sweet describing a sort of this

212
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
This truly

213
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,999
Very modern

214
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,279
Powerful

215
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Big Brother machine that is

216
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
That is essentially powered by palantir

217
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
The CIA funded

218
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
It's really like

219
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
Like omnipotent knowledge

220
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
It's really really incredible and unsettling

221
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,871
Disorder think about

222
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Just

223
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Galaxy information

224
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
I can be

225
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
Used against different types

226
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Individuals

227
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
And Hound

228
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,879
Making a profit off of

229
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,719
This is something if they've designed that they didn't then sell around the country

230
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,791
An around-the-world to I think they work with other governments

231
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,607
They work with corporations to major corporations

232
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
Yeah found here is a really

233
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,471
Expensive software in fact sometimes it

234
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,007
So expensive that

235
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Different governments

236
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
Can't afford to renew it

237
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
But

238
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:28,991
Lucky for the governments that are using them at least in the case of the northern California regional until

239
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Elgin Centre

240
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
And what's called a Perpetual license

241
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,855
Which means that even after the last

242
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:39,231
Contract. Expires they still have access to palantir and they can still continue to use it

243
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
I just won't get like

244
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,023
Updates

245
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
So that not only

246
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
Eliminate

247
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,887
Paper trail

248
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,727
There I'm in terms of like after the contract. Expires but

249
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,055
It basically means that all of this information is

250
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,359
Indefinitely in the hands

251
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
The police

252
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,687
Now I'm just probably good time to ask you

253
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,735
What does the name pounds

254
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,503
Here come from

255
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
Well

256
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,599
Apparently it's from Lord of the Rings

257
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,647
And it's some sort of

258
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
All-knowing orb

259
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:15,071
Full disclosure not read Lord of the Rings

260
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
Full disclosure

261
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,239
Lord of the Rings near Dover here

262
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
Parable monstrous wizard uses

263
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,847
To look around

264
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,663
Middle aerosat anyone whenever he wants

265
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
Yeah I love that

266
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
What old is Bruno Mars

267
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
We have worked

268
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:44,255
Yeah it's great when you're putting the moral Foundation of your company until like an evil nerd thing

269
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,583
That's great very reassuring that never ends well

270
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
Imagine reading that book and being like

271
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
That sounds great

272
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
Imagine that being here take away I mean

273
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Again I think

274
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
Wait I did read I read The Hobbit

275
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,663
I did I do know that there's very clear distinctions between Good and Evil

276
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,991
Seemingly when I read it so Saruman is not a good dude

277
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,039
She was actually at one point

278
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Like a semi good dude

279
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
And then

280
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
Becomes schist

281
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,695
Montana

282
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
Like a monstrous evil character

283
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:19,839
This is what Peter Thiel took his inspiration from when he's like you know what I mean

284
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,887
Bu founder of

285
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Surveillance company

286
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
And I'm going to call pounds

287
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,031
It's nice to sort of take pride in that and

288
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Michuzi

289
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
In character

290
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
Fur for him

291
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,015
But you know this is a company that has

292
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Incredible amount

293
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,647
Of power but also the relationships that has

294
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Also

295
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:51,327
Incredibly powerful right so we know that there's been some weird connections between palantir Cambridge analytica

296
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
And Facebook

297
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,727
This is a company that has is not only itself extremely powerful and has

298
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
A lot of relationship

299
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,079
Within the US intelligence community and longpoint

300
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:06,687
In fact the most powerful agencies in the entire world

301
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,991
It also has these weird relationships

302
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
With

303
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
People like Facebook

304
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,343
Is Mark Zuckerberg

305
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,183
Did you ever hear Mark Zuckerberg testimony when he was questioned

306
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
In the senate committee on palantir

307
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,863
I don't know if I did actually I remember watching the Senate testimony but I don't remember that but suppose

308
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,911
It is incredibly weird

309
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
Do you know who palantir is

310
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
Baidu

311
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,151
Some people have referred to them as a Stanford analytica

312
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Do you agree

313
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
Senator I have not heard that

314
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
Okay do you think palantir taught

315
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,927
Cambridge analytica press reports are saying

316
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,719
How to do these tactics

317
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Senator I don't know

318
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,631
To me what makes this company really fascinating and and

319
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
The story that you did today

320
00:13:59,423 --> 00:13:59,935
Exposing

321
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
This manual

322
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007
That allows

323
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,567
To catch a glimpse of just what the company can do and get on you

324
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Is

325
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
There's a lot known about it

326
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Yeah it's

327
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:14,015
It's funny because there's been a lot of stories that have been done about

328
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:18,111
Apologia can manage different types of information systems but if you just

329
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,695
I mean let's say if you go on like palantir is like

330
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,559
YouTube page and look at his promotional videos I made a video that's like how does palantir work

331
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,863
It's just a bunch of Graphics that show nothing

332
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,423
Mountaire brings in many databases into one system

333
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,727
How many pounds are brings in the following database

334
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,287
Crime and arrest report information

335
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,103
Field interview cards

336
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,407
Automatic License Plate Reader information

337
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,479
Like they absolutely no insight into how this works

338
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
On a practical level

339
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:52,671
I was interesting about the Goddess that they actually include examples of the interphase and what happens when you make a potato

340
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,231
Type of search and the type of results you got

341
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,559
Like for instance you can make a search for a person's name

342
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,607
Get a lot of results and then

343
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,423
Filtered on the right side by different types of like

344
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,751
First and last name matches different addresses

345
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,359
And pretty much any possible datapoint associated with that person and there is like

346
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
I got two dozen different datapoints and like

347
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,759
Another half dozen data points that

348
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:22,111
Describe those former datapoints just like hundreds of different ruminations

349
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,159
Away season catalog

350
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
People

351
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
That's the thing is that

352
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
People Like Us

353
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,791
They're working in the space note palantir is

354
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
And

355
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,607
This company could

356
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
Information on Earth

357
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
But the wider public has no idea

358
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
What town

359
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Right

360
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,567
And I think

361
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,895
I think Thomas has gotten some attention lately because of its

362
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,431
It's contact with ice

363
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,503
Which is expiring soon and activist of men

364
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
Speaking up and

365
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,159
Encouraging this contract to end and even when palantir was invited to host

366
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:56,927
Conference

367
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,767
I think if I think it was at one of the University of California campuses

368
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,583
Activists were saying that they didn't want to volunteer to be

369
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,887
Conference that it would be

370
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:10,239
An insult to the kind of business that it does because it basically manages

371
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,055
Different case records that can be used

372
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
To help build up legal cases against

373
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
People who

374
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
Could potentially be

375
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
Deported people who are being held in detention

376
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,039
And so it's gotten attention in

377
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
And not contacts

378
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
But I think what

379
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
Sort of makes me sad is

380
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,439
The fact that when I

381
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
Find out about this whole Perpetual license

382
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,279
Like even if it's contract

383
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
The palantir is

384
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
Aspiring

385
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,239
I mean we can look at what's going on with the ncric that doesn't mean that ice won't be able to use palantir anymore

386
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,567
They're either going to get a service that works almost exactly the same way

387
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,639
Which as matter fact that's what's happening with that

388
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Particular agent

389
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,711
They said powder is too expensive

390
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,271
We're replacing it with SAS

391
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,319
Which is basically going to do something

392
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,087
Similar

393
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
And with ice

394
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:03,999
Even if they don't renew that contract that just means they won't get updates or like Live help

395
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,815
If there are troubleshooting a problem they can still use it

396
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,679
They can still track and log immigrants in build cases against them in that same

397
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,471
Detail oriented way

398
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,287
This really is like the machine of

399
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
Big Brother

400
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
The Leviathan

401
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
Yeah

402
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,663
I don't know

403
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
Just kind of bums me out

404
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,783
I can tell a story really did affect you this is something you really care about

405
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
Yeah I don't know it's just

406
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,903
It's disheartening to think about like

407
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,719
Every single way that way you can move the world is

408
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
Can be against us

409
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
I feel like it's been something that's been really

410
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
I don't know how

411
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
Something about it

412
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
About it a lot lately like

413
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,543
In a hunter related somewhat unrelated note you know just the fact that

414
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
A lot of stores are peddling to

415
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,127
Like not accepting cash

416
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,663
Meaning that you know

417
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,967
If you're using your debit or credit card these are all Purge

418
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
Just as I can be

419
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
Tracked and can potentially get into

420
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,087
Other people's hands whatever this is

421
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,903
A data broker or some other kind of way

422
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,511
Every system that catalogs are moved is not designed to be used in our favor and never is

423
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:13,631
You know what I think is a great example of that like is to as long as that information is actionable

424
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
It's going to be used against people

425
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Yeah

426
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
Just leaving in terms of like

427
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:23,359
Bringing this back to Lord of the Rings and again speaking vaguely as someone who has not read the book

428
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
I don't know it's trying to have these

429
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:29,503
These understandings of Good and Evil especially when it seems to have a

430
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:34,879
Pretty clear association with evil and the book if I'm speaking correctly

431
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,695
I don't know there's just a lot of things that seem to be in cancer

432
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
About that

433
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
Xiamen

434
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,583
Well Carolyn thank you for being on Cyber this is your cyber debut isn't it

435
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,935
Thanks for having me you'll be back on again I'm sure soon when you

436
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:53,311
Discovered something else that will piss off a Silicon Valley spying on me
