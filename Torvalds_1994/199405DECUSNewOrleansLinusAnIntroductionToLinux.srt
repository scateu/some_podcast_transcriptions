1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:06,960
It is a full UNIX implementation and that it does support virtual memory.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,610
It's not one of the small UNIX like coherent or minix or something like that.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,370
It tries to support everything.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,830
It's ..  there are UNIX system that do more than Linux, but there are UNIX systems.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:29,850
So it has special memory memory mapping, full TCP/IP networking.

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,470
Even though there have been rumors, it's not very stable, it is.

7
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:57,900
Most of the time [hahaha] it has System V inter process communication and BSD sockets, and it has full UNIX file systems, and it's not the System V 14 character limit file system, but it has 255 characters file systems.

8
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,720
And the 14 character file system and the DOS file system and so on.

9
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,320
Oh, sorry, I didn't even mention it's free.

10
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,090
I mean, I take take it for granted that it's free and it's very open.

11
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,090
If I were a marketing department I'd call it open Linux, [Laugh] but that's why not.

12
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,070
As I'm not.

13
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,130
I just call it Linux and tell you it's open.

14
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,070
And free, and it's written from scratch.

15
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,250
So you don't have to pay AT&T or anything at all.

16
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:48,210
Um, okay, ah, it's available by FTP, so.

17
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:54,780
If you want to know where, I can put it down later or something like that.

18
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,160
Okay, this is a small slide.

19
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,950
And I run out of room, so I'll just try to tell you anyway, ah.

20
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,530
The main thing about Linux.

21
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:18,310
Is the good hardware support, it actually runs on more hardware than any other PC UNIX, that's at least my guess.

22
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,030
SCO might be close.

23
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,360
Or it might be slightly better, but Linux

24
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,040
has drivers.

25
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:39,420
For almost anything out there except the new stuff DEC puts in its PCs that we had terrible problems getting Linux running on the DEC PC or in the uh.

26
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:48,120
Whatever ya it also.

27
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,080
Has.

28
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,440
Support for lack of hardware.

29
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,680
So if you don't have hardware like a co processor, it will emulate it.

30
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,250
Uh.

31
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:05,070
If you want to use something like DOS, which I suppose you don't, but if you want.

32
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,580
To use it.

33
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,900
You can use it together with Linux, either under the Linux.

34
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:19,320
DOS simulator or side by side by rebooting into DOS, some model systems actually take over the whole disk.

35
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,610
I think BSD ..

36
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,620
They're early version certainly did.

37
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,320
I don't know about the newer ones.

38
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:40,560
Uh, it's also very useful for personal use due to the low cost, low cost of the actual operating system, which is free.

39
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,840
And the low cost of the hardware it runs on, you can get an unbeatable

40
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,240
price performance system uh, it's also pretty expandable.

41
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,880
Uh, due to the fact that you can .. if you're really hurting.

42
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,950
You can write your own drivers and

43
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:01,920
Whatever.

44
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,000
Uh, you also.

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,320
With a full Linux system like on the cdrom, you get a complete system with X11

46
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:28,280
Compilers like gcc translators like p to c small talk and so on me anything plus.

47
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,280
10 or 20 editors, and so on.

48
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:44,600
Anything you want. uh for the professional user, it's mostly useful for software development.

49
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
If you do work in a SunOS (?)

50
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,960
system or similar and do UNIX programming.

51
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,500
You can have a whole machine running Linux

52
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,540
Academic use due to the fact that you have sources available.

53
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,570
For now, additional costs and you can implement your own features.

54
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,290
You can test out your theories.

55
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:14,140
I know Linux has been used in academia too

56
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:24,250
Test out things like new file systems test out uh,... behind large address.

57
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:38,290
Space machines they simulated, a 64-bit machine using Linux, and I know that somebody submitted the paper on it to [?] somewhere USENIX?

58
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,170
Last year, I don't know if it was actually accepted.

59
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,240
But the largest reason for running Linux is technical superiority.

60
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,640
It's simply better than anything out there in the world.

61
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,700
Ah, it's faster.

62
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,670
It's smaller, it's [FIXME] mean or it slices dices, and so on.

63
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:12,500
It runs endless loops in under 6 seconds or whatever works on everything and

64
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,420
And works very well.

65
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:19,930
Uh, I know people have started using Linux because it's free.

66
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:20,850
And so on.

67
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,749
So it's the cheap alternative.

68
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:29,089
I also know people who have actually actually switched from a real UNIX

69
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,910
to Linux, because it's faster and it's more stable.

70
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,080
On the other hand.

71
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,330
You may not want to use Linux.

72
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,790
There's a noticeable lack of support uh.

73
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,370
There are Linux companies out there.

74
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,100
I know they're in the US.

75
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:06,250
There's one Finland and uh, but obviously you can't call a 1 800 number and just ask for support.

76
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,450
On the other hand, you do have support in electronic form.

77
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,920
If you are connected to the network.

78
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,850
There are five Linux News groups who are there to support you uh.

79
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,060
And there are mailing lists too, but that may not be quite what you want.

80
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,670
Also, the documentation of Linux is kind of sparse.

81
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,780
Um, it's mostly in electronic form.

82
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,250
I know of three books in German.

83
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,620
Sadly enough, I don't speak any German.

84
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,210
I know one book in English.

85
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,740
Which is available both electronically and in paper back.

86
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,600
But you are not going to get

87
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,360
kind of 5 meters of documentation, when you

88
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,840
Which may be a good point after all. Also,

89
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,930
It doesn't run many commercial programs.

90
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:19,770
If you want to run, okay, Windows Write or something like that, it doesn't run on Linux yet.

91
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,490
Uh.

92
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,500
Math math lab.

93
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,390
Has been a problem in some circles.

94
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,080
There are alternatives, but they are general.

95
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:37,610
Have problems, things like that also one problem with Linux is actual.

96
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,790
Trusting the system because it's three people tend to think okay.

97
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,010
You get what you pay for, which.

98
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,250
Is kind of irritating.

99
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:56,580
For me personally, also, while it's technically superior, it does have some technical problems.

100
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,870
Ah, while I said it runs on almost everything I meant.

101
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:07,710
It runs on almost any PC, it does not run on the Alpha yet.

102
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,610
It also does not run on

103
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,160
SPARCstation, so you are stuck with Solaris in that case.

104
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,400
I'm actually hoping to have an alpha board at home.

105
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:28,600
For testing for half a year, so we'll see what comes in. What?

106
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,430
Excuse me, [question from audience] uh.

107
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,240
There is 68k port going on.

108
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,290
For the older max, but.

109
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,350
It's actually for for the Atari and

110
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,630
AMIGA computers.

111
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,110
And uh, I doubt it will ever get ported to the Mac.

112
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,360
The documentation on the hardware level is kind of kind

113
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:06,490
Sorry, the Power PC, maybe also the code is kind of young.

114
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:13,250
The hell of kernel is less than 3 years old, so uh parts like networking.

115
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,920
Still do have its own stability problems.

116
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,060
Uh, there are small

117
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:29,900
limitations like the memory mapping actually only support three dominant things on fives right now.

118
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,865
So you can't map in a file into memory, write to memory and and the file changes.

119
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:38,910
You can only map them[?] read on.

120
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,250
Okay, I hope, everyone.

121
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,760
Everybody knows what Linux is

122
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:03,260
So we'll take up why why it's been written.

123
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:15,720
Ah, the obvious answer is DOS, a PC hardware is getting lots better, but the operating system certainly ...

124
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,730
have not been getting better as fast as the hardware.

125
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,930
So when I bought the computer, I didn't want to run DOS.

126
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,150
Instead, I bought a small UNIX system called Minix.

127
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,200
Written by Andy Tanenbaum of Amsterdam.

128
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,190
And run that.

129
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:43,110
But the limitations of that system just resulted in me

130
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,160
actually, starting writing my own.

131
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
Ah.

132
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,130
The reason I couldn't use real UNIX

133
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,060
was because real UNIX costs, lots of money.

134
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:06,370
Ah, it's become cheaper now, I hope partially because of the Linux, but back three years ago, a real UNIX

135
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,430
full license costs something like 20,000 Finnish markkas.

136
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,300
Which is what 5000 dollars 4000 dollars.

137
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:26,640
So for students with no money at all, it's not really a an option.

138
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:37,800
Of course, those are just the the kind of motivations you you want to say the real motivation, of course.

139
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,180
Was just to have fun and write something interesting.

140
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:48,060
Uh, it's also turned out to be highly educational, and you get if you write your own operating system.

141
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:54,260
You get to travel all around the world and see interesting and weird people. Like yourselves ..

142
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:07,080
Actually, what you need to write your own UNIX is a) you have to be star craving mad.

143
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:14,300
But that's not a problem, at least from limited experience I've had with the UNIX people.

144
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:20,800
So so I have 4 kind of four main points.

145
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,280
You have to be totally ignorant if you know what you're doing, you obviously do.

146
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,820
I also know that this is not worth.

147
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:36,550
I mean, if you know the semantics(语义) of select() how many people know select()?

148
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,890
Okay, well, you're.

149
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:46,864
Out already, you don't want the implement select() in under UNIX so on,

150
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:56,979
also, you have to be an arrogant bastard, because assuming hypothetical question,

151
00:13:56,979 --> 00:14:01,610
assuming you were writing your own operating system under a system.

152
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,440
called Minix, which has been written by a very well known.

153
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,460
professor inside of the operating system community.

154
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,580
Assuming you will be writing it, and this professor publicly announced

155
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:21,420
your system was worth nothing and was obsolete before it was saved(?) and written.

156
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,940
What's your reaction?

157
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:27,853
a) you think he's probably right and forget about it,

158
00:14:27,853 --> 00:14:32,144
b) you think, okay, I'll try anyway or

159
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:43,480
c) ha. what does he know anyway, if you answered c, then okay, you might be in for into in the running.

160
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,600
Yet actually, this was not a hypothetical question, as you might tell.

161
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,530
But what's actually what's happened.

162
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:58,426
So okay, once you've got the system running up and running and doing something,

163
00:14:58,426 --> 00:15:06,940
you have to actually have this time, you have to continue with it because there's gonna be

164
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,030
problems and you're going to hit your head against the wall

165
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:17,470
several times, so you'd better just keep on going, and then every once in a while,

166
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,470
You have to have some inspiration.

167
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,740
Ah, I can solve this problem this way.

168
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,280
That's actually the smallest part, I think.

169
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:42,020
Okay, over to some dates, ah, I bought my PC in early 1991.

170
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:50,063
That was after having gone through a UNIX uh class at the university,

171
00:15:50,063 --> 00:16:01,680
so I had seen my first UNIX half a year before that, uh, I'm decided all at once that I wanted to use CUNIX? at home,

172
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:12,290
too. So I bought the Minix system and what I didn't start out to do was write an operating system.

173
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:22,380
Instead, Minix lacked terminal (?feature), so I wrote my own, and I actually wanted to test out my new machine at the same time.

174
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,960
So I decided, okay, let's see, this machine has

175
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,560
multitasking capabilities in hardware.

176
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:34,740
So let's do it by doing two tasks in the terminal emulator, quite like kermit does.

177
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,680
But we do it in hardware all the way, so I did a very simple program.

178
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,590
Well, actually, it's not very simple because the

179
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:55,550
386 protected mode hardware is very hard to actually program, that was a terminal emulation.

180
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,790
That's where it all began and then.

181
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,030
I kind of added features, and soon it was the GNU Emacs of

182
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,490
terminal emulators and I called it Linux.

183
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,470
This was in.

184
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,200
Well, in.

185
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:22,310
August 91 I actually had a system that leads something useful, so I made it public in September.

186
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,800
To get some feedback.

187
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:30,980
And to be quite frank, at that point, it wasn't worth very much, it's booted, it ran a shell.

188
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,510
It ran GCC, which was might .. kind of first milestone.

189
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:46,290
But if you tried to compile a big program, it's crashed because the buffer handling didn't work out very well.

190
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:47,660
Uh.

191
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,170
So I kind of worked on that.

192
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,170
And by November 91.

193
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,400
Really worked very well.

194
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:10,500
And people who had used Minix's before were starting to switch over because Linux give things faster, work, better on past machines and so on.

195
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,570
By that time.

196
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,290
I got the problem that I had 8 megs on memory.

197
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:21,180
Which was ampful? by my standards back then

198
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:28,415
And could compile the kernel with no problems at all, but people who had smaller machines like just two megs

199
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:40,284
also wanted to start playing this, and they couldn't compile the kernel because they didn't have enough space for for gcc,

200
00:18:40,284 --> 00:18:44,820
so just to get one of those people off my back.

201
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:53,490
I sat down and wrote the virtual memory in 3 days before Christmas, 91 ah.

202
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,870
It actually worked.

203
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:06,900
But had so many bugs that the last one was found kind of half a year later, last or so, okay.

204
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,380
Then in May of 92, we.

205
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:18,401
Actually got X11 release 5 working at that time, it was

206
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:31,240
really a port (移植) of the official X consortium X11 code uh a month later, Linux got into the XFree86 projects.

207
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:40,210
That's what we're using now, which is kind of it's X11 R5, but it's got lots of enhancements for the PC.

208
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,340
And then I skip lots of things.

209
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:52,670
Networking got started with X, drivers got written and so on.

210
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,300
And this March, I released.

211
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,730
Version 1.0.

212
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:00,540
All in all.

213
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:12,260
It took a pretty exactly three years from from beginning of coding to 1.0, which is not too bad.

214
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:16,540
Okay.

215
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,210
I don't know what your reaction is.

216
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,860
But I know I get the question pretty often.

217
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,550
Why make it free, you could be the Bill Gates of Finland by now.

218
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:36,940
If you hadn't it actually I struck off by answering, no.

219
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:43,400
I wouldn't, because if I hadn't made it free would never have developed as it has,

220
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:50,150
I probably had thought it's an interesting project and continued for half a year on it.

221
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,020
And then I'd say.

222
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,616
Okay, this is nice, and I had left.

223
00:20:54,616 --> 00:21:01,430
Making it free and available for lots of people adds a lot to your motivation.

224
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,730
You get kind of you, get the feed back.

225
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,050
That motivates you to continue developing the system.

226
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:19,030
Uh, I got lots of nails for the first few releases, which.

227
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,350
were not really usable that they're kind of.

228
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:29,350
Still kept me going, and the feedback also results in in bug reports.

229
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,940
So you fix the bugs faster, because you actually notice them.

230
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:40,720
Uh, it also results in lots of new ideas when I started out writing

231
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,750
Linux I didn't know what a PTY was, and as I mentioned, I didn't know what select() was.

232
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:50,850
I was totally clueless about UNIX.

233
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:56,160
And I got lots of good ideas from making it public and letting people say.

234
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,720
Hey, why doesn't this one support select()?

235
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,560
I'd like to use select()

236
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:05,188
I said, what? okay, so.

237
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:16,850
also testing, especially on PC hardware testing, is a real problem because PC hardware is junk, the processor is good.

238
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,080
Actually, I like the 386.

239
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,590
It has too few registers but

240
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,240
it's a solid piece of hardware, otherwise, but the surrounding

241
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:34,180
hardware is very varied and do it doesn't always work the way it's supposed.

242
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:44,530
So when you do a PC port of UNIX, you are in for lots of surprises, and I think SUN

243
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:51,837
noticed this with 386 Solaris, which I think is dead, maybe not officially,

244
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:59,200
but it didn't seem to work on as many machines as they had hoped.

245
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:12,070
Also, not just testing, but people actually wrote drivers, so peripherals I couldn't even test because I didn't have them.

246
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:19,630
Other people wrote drivers for and uh now Linux has drivers for something like

247
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:25,120
10 different SCSI uh controllers, of which I have just

248
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,640
one, and I didn't even need to write the driver for that.

249
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,450
So I say I'm the father of Linux.

250
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,690
But actually, I've written probably less than half of the code in the kernel.

251
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:58,010
Uh, the disadvantages of making it free, I'll start off by saying these are the disadvantages people expect they aren't real negative comments.

252
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:04,510
You may be a bit afraid about people would say about your coding style, hey, this works, but.

253
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:11,210
Actually, I have gotten very few negative comments at all.

254
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,510
Most of them were from the aforementioned Andrew Tanenbaum

255
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:24,290
Also making it free under the GPL.

256
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,570
People start wondering.

257
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,860
Don't you feel bad about it?

258
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:34,000
If people take advantage of your work and sell it for lots of money.

259
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,470
Actually, nobody has sold it for lots of money, but.

260
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,330
The CDROMs that are going to be a ?rough adult?.

261
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,260
They are being sold by for money, and no, I'm not getting anything for it.

262
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:55,220
I don't mind, frankly, I enjoy the publicity and getting.

263
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,290
Fly flight over the world and so on.

264
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,540
And okay, no economic gain already.

265
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,930
It's [inaudible] there.

266
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,340
Uh, I expect to get some economic gain from it.

267
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,920
I'm pretty sure I will get a job working at some company someday.

268
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:33,360
Okay, we a bit early, maybe by now, the user base.

269
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,240
Which I have no idea about how large it is.

270
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:44,260
It's large uh Linux is probably the largest PC UNIX in the world right now.

271
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:52,410
Uh, I have no firm numbers, but I expect 100000 machines

272
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,260
running Linux to be a lower bound.

273
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:07,850
The only numbers I have is that the CDROM was sold in 10000 copies.

274
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,800
For the first release.

275
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,230
And people who who get it by FTP are probably

276
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:24,100
more, more usual, so so Linux is actually pretty popular.

277
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:28,927
There are lots of different different distributions.

278
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:38,510
The ones being raffled out, are, what, trans america tech, okay, there's the [inaudible] I already mentioned.

279
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:49,660
There's a couple of CDROM distributions that are essentially just copies of the ftp sites, and some other.

280
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,790
I think I personally have five CDROMs.

281
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,570
Different CDROMs and I don't do anything with them.

282
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,030
Because I don't have a drive.

283
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:10,570
Uh, there's also kind of disk copying services going on one in Canada, probably a few in the US.

284
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,420
And there are lots of different distributions.

285
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:19,160
Just being made available by FTP.

286
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,310
I don't actually do with these distributions.

287
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:31,670
I just do the kernel sources and let other people then compile it and make a complete system of it.

288
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:39,210
So and so I try to not have to do with those things.

289
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:48,040
Also, Linux is finally getting some media recognition uh PC Week

290
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,050
Uh.

291
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,530
Had it as their product for the week here.

292
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,950
A month ago, perhaps.

293
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:02,800
So we hope that the user base will actually grow.

294
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,202
Then off for some comments about the future

295
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:15,460
uh with the 1.0 release, I got a few

296
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:26,100
questions about a) will it continue to be free and b) will I continue to develop it and the answer to both is

297
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,660
In fact, there is already a 1.1 source tree

298
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:47,460
Is available at the PC in the in the hall across building the new release is.

299
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:56,180
Adds memory management and networking capabilities, and I'll obviously be continuing

300
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:03,620
work on the Linux for at least the next few years, if if interests keeps and keeps up

301
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:11,070
Also will add or work on adding source compatibility.

302
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,340
We.

303
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:26,080
None of the standards are actually ratified(批准生效) right now because it seems to cost a lot, but there has been some talk about actually ratifying Linux as POSIX.1

304
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,430
And possibly some other standards, I have the XPG 3 manuals.

305
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:41,200
I've opened and once they were boring and I closed them again, maybe somebody else will do the work.

306
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,800
For [inaudible], so we can always hope.

307
00:29:44,800 --> 00:30:06,810
Also, while i'm not very excited about the idea, uh Linux is moving into the direction of binary compatibility with those through the DOS simulation, which actually works pretty well right now, it's still considered to be alpha software.

308
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,771
But it's available.

309
00:30:09,771 --> 00:30:14,263
And runs most, most normal DOS programs.

310
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:17,830
It doesn't run games very well.

311
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:22,520
But you can use it for Word Perfect and so on it also it

312
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,640
even works under an XTerm, a bit

313
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,710
slower and you know, that's completely.

314
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,660
We are also working on, and indeed, it works already again.

315
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,420
The porting, the standard.

316
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,910
Intel binary compatibility specification.

317
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:30,390
Version 2 ACEBC S2? to this is done through loadable modules, which change the personality of the system so that the system calls operate the way.

318
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:41,660
The standard wineries expect them to. This is not part of the standard kernel right now, but people report that

319
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,250
with the patches.

320
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:50,300
It actually runs SCO binaries of Word Perfect under X.

321
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,650
So that way.

322
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:58,240
We'll get some commercial support for people who need the commercial programs.

323
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:05,960
Also, then, perhaps most exciting product would be a

324
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,220
Windows emulation there's work going on with a

325
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:16,040
a project called WINE, which will should

326
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,710
be a free Windows emulator

327
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:25,050
For the X uh, it's not even close to ready yet.

328
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:31,850
It runs the most important program, which is the solitaire game.

329
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,100
But that's about it.

330
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,070
There's been rumors of.

331
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:42,320
The SUN will be product whatever they call it.

332
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:54,320
There's also been rumors about a third product for Novell, which I may come into a bit.

333
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,980
Uh, the idea is that with Windows emulation

334
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,093
You could actually run a large number of

335
00:35:02,093 --> 00:35:04,349
Good programs, which suddenly.

336
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:08,610
Now run only under a large number of bad operating systems.

337
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:28,300
And some future too, I already mentioned the 68k port, which is at Linux 1.0 standard, but

338
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:39,680
Is not complete at this point and doesn't run on on very many machines.

339
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,470
It runs on some AMIGAs.

340
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:48,900
There is a booting Atari port, but it's a step in the right.

341
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,440
direction also, there has been a lot of discussions.

342
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:05,470
About supporting Linux to some of the more interesting RISC, newer RISC processors like the DEC Alpha and the Power PC.

343
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,950
I have a contact that.

344
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,890
Netherlands who is going to contact the Finland.

345
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,730
Who is possibly going to get me a DEC Alpha machine.

346
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,810
We don't know. Also ...

347
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,445
Work on documentation.

348
00:36:25,445 --> 00:36:34,850
And support is is is still going on, so there are the books I already mentioned.

349
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:45,290
There are more on the way, the kind installation and system administration guides needed to to get the new user going.

350
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:52,880
Also, companies like novel,

351
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,300
which, as you may know, owns the UNIX source licenses.

352
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,370
There, well, so.

353
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:11,250
Small article in PC Week again April 25th, that said.

354
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,840
Novel is actually going to release

355
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,730
Or possibly going to release a.

356
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,690
CDROM containing not UNIX ware, but Linux.

357
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,110
Along with a Windows simulator.

358
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:34,420
Looking glass X windows interface and so on, this may or may not be reality.

359
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:40,040
But it at least shows that people and companies are looking into Linux.

360
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,270
As a viable(切实可行的) alternative to commercial software.

361
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,800
I'm afraid that's about it.

362
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,420
I'll do the step dance after the second session.

363
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,930
I see you survived the first one.

364
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,840
There wasn't any real problem, was there.

365
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,390
Are there any problems?

366
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,970
Like to remind you of two things

367
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:32,570
So if you haven't already done, want to drop your card or your badge in the bag up here for the drawing, we're gonna be raffling off two autographed copies of the trans American Linux Linux CDROMs, and also, i'd like to thank John Hall and digital equipment corporation for making these talks possible.

368
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,090
Stand up, John.

369
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:56,820
I would have took your fine Irish temper, so if there are any questions, please line up behind the mic far away.

370
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,310
1 question.

371
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,950
Do you know if any of the major.

372
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,650
Uh database companies like Oracle.

373
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,792
Or Sybase or any of those folks are planning on pouring their products to Linux?

374
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:13,510
The question was, do you know any major database companies planning to port to Linux?

375
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,620
And the answer is no.

376
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,050
I have no idea and.

377
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:25,360
I'm not a database person myself, so that I wouldn't have even looked into it, thought it.

378
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:28,630
Could you write.

379
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,060
Could you write down the ftp sites that have the one point of.

380
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:33,960
Yeah.

381
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,490
Does anybody have a pen , right.

382
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:39,320
Yeah.

383
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,470
Is this one.

384
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,310
I assume most of you aren't Finnish and one of you is.

385
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,880
But in the US.

386
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:18,655
The main sites are tsx-11.mit.edu

387
00:40:18,655 --> 00:40:26,480
sunsite.unc.edu this one is in.

388
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:38,720
Um, maybe this one is also, but with a capital L

389
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,770
There are lots of others, but.

390
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:47,030
These are the two major ones in the US.

391
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,990
Actually, I might add that.

392
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,870
If you do get this UNIX distribution, the best one is.

393
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,660
At this point seems to be the one called Slackware.

394
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,500
Which should be images slackware.

395
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:20,160
On sunsite, I don't remember the exact location on tsx-11.

396
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:24,970
That one.

397
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,140
Contains enough documentation to get you started and.

398
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,120
And lots of things.

399
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:39,700
It's a completely UNIX system takes up 130 megs of your hard disk

400
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,390
if you want to install it at all, okay.

401
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,100
Any other question.

402
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,540
Anthony Collins international Potato center in Lima

403
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:01,950
following on to the previous question, I was going to ask if anyone knew whether Oracle version 6.

404
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:13,290
would run on the Linux, what could you, I guess the question was whether Oracle version 6 would run under Linux uh.

405
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,760
I don't know anything about Oracle versions.

406
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,810
I know they're only.

407
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:25,410
Oh, okay, there are a few databases running under Linux and they're just

408
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,640
What the GNU one, which.

409
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:39,230
Is called metal base or something like that, so I think the older versions of the ingress.

410
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:46,230
I think. I can add the observation that Oracle version 5 is available and runs under xenic.

411
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,980
Well, it might.

412
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,310
Actually run under Linux with the iBCS2 patches.

413
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,520
I haven't tried.

414
00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:01,510
I actually have no System V software at all, so I haven't tried the iBCS2 patches at all.

415
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,710
I kind of I started off from scratch, so I don't have any.

416
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:09,190
Installed base of software I could try on.

417
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:17,000
Sorry, okay, any other questions.

418
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:19,870
Okay, if not.

419
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:27,100
Let's draw some names, you get to do that.

420
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,650
I get to do that.

421
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:45,420
From the bottom of the bucket and.

422
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:48,390
David E Ellis.

423
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:52,560
Vice president, chief scientist, rocket scientist and director.

424
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,880
Of Albuquerque operations.

425
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:13,270
And before in my life, and then the second person.

426
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,020
Timothy Cook, computer specialists from.

427
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,230
I'm not going to pronounce this one.

428
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:31,830
[ Inaudible ]

429
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,670
Congratulations, I just won a free copy of the Linux

430
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:57,140
Okay.

431
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,480
Oh.

432
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:10,990
Yeah, he did say he was going to be tap dancing and doing traditional Finnish folk dances in between the sessions. Where's Christie, she was going to accompany.

433
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,740
Could we take this after the second talk.

434
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:29,870
Uh distributions like where, okay, i'm told.

435
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,400
It's.

436
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:40,770
Okay.

437
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,420
Instead of the images.

438
00:45:51,290 --> 00:46:07,800
Images and distributions, okay, what it's I'm actually not certain I was, I'd I'd have thought it was images slackware, but.

439
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,260
It might be images, distribution, slackware or it might.

440
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,020
Be just distribution like.

441
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,210
And you'll find the issue you have.

442
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:20,920
A working directory listing route

443
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:26,600
hopefully yes.

444
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:38,760
Uh, there are no public domain ports of Motif, but there is a commercial version of Motif, which.

445
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,780
Sells for 89 dollars for the limited version.

446
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:49,180
100 and something dollars for the development version

447
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:56,690
Actually, they are selling a motif package, which it's labeled motif.

448
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:03,980
I understand, but it actually contains a complete Linux distribution so you can just buy a cd.

449
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:10,490
ROM and gets Motif and Linux. Motif isn't available

450
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:13,160
for free anywhere.

451
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:22,140
There is now currently a Linux journal as well, and in fact there might be two people from the Linux journal here.

452
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,800
If you're if you're here, you want to identify yourself by looking at each other and saying, hi, I work with you.

453
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:35,030
I know they were going to come.  I'm not sure if they're here or not.

454
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:35,610
They are.

455
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,160
There's all two of them.

456
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:39,640
Um.

457
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:56,140
You'll find a lot of the vendors are advertising in the journal, and it's actually a pretty good source of information as well as the news groups and as well as quartering Linux and talking to him.

458
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:00,000
So anyway, next session.

459
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,670
[..] tells a little bit about.

460
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:08,020
The window manager included in the in the X11 distribution.

461
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:20,690
The window manager there are actually several ones, the best one, in my opinion, is O feeble window manager.

462
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:25,430
Which was written for Linux originally, but now ported to several other architecture.

463
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:36,660
Which is kind of a based on TVMs sources and then added lots of features.

464
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:41,220
Nifty features it's almost completely customizable.

465
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,460
There's open look if you want that.

466
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:53,180
Not if you already mentioned TVM CTVM, they're all available, but if you want.

467
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:58,230
I actually appreciate a few more questions.

468
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,170
So I don't like my step dance.

469
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,330
Okay, we can just go on and.

470
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,010
Stop for early, maybe.

471
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,280
You're you're not getting out of the tap dancing that easy.

472
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,540
Why don't you have a seat, relax and take a deep breath, have a beer.

473
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:29,230
And.

474
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,004
A question where

475
00:49:33,004 --> 00:49:39,180
Frank Dennis, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, and it's just of curiosity, what are people actually.

476
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:39,910
Doing with it.

477
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:45,180
What's the most ambitious application of Linux that you know?

478
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:45,220
Oh.

479
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,620
Ambitious, ambitious? oh.

480
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:54,750
Like challenging?

481
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:58,940
well, the most challenging is writing operating systems.

482
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,100
Uh, I know Linux is used.

483
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,230
For.

484
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:10,560
Linux on PCs used for as cheap X terminals at one hospital.

485
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,290
I don't know at which, so you can't avoid it if you are there uh.

486
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:19,660
I also know there's Linux PC.

487
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:25,486
On Antarctica, doing some kind of mail forwarding or similar,

488
00:50:25,486 --> 00:50:38,990
I know there's a Linux PC on one large super tanker, which is used to as a FAX forwarder.

489
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:42,310
With satellite tooling console.

490
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,830
Ooph hard to say.

491
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:55,240
It's rumored AT&T has a Linux lab with Linux machines.

492
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,460
But that's.

493
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,300
Ya, alright.

494
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,030
Yeah, probably.

495
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,300
Well, I'm going for.

496
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:25,130
A master of sciences, but I've been going for that now for five years, I expected to take at least two more years.

497
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:31,960
Okay [inaudible name] organized consulting, I'm believe I'm here because I disdained Finnish folk dancing.

498
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:32,990
So.

499
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,980
I just question as long those lines.

500
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,910
How old are you with your background.

501
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,690
Computers how long you've been doing this.

502
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,710
How long do you sleep every night, things like that.

503
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,750
Only only one question at a time.

504
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,110
And please go to the end of the line after asking each one.

505
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,740
Uh, what was the first one?

506
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:52,060
I'm 25.

507
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:59,400
Year 24 actually yeah, hard to keep track 24 years old started when I was 11.

508
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:10,360
On a VIC-20, if it's familiar to any of you uh, then moved on to Sinclair QL, which.

509
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,670
Probably isn't familiar to any other.

510
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:17,300
Uh, which taught me never to buy a small.

511
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,090
Machine that wasn't supportive, so I bought a PC even though it had done.

512
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:23,570
Uh.

513
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:25,360
I do sleep 8 hours a night.

514
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,810
I lied when I said I didn't sleep pretty much.

515
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,360
The fact that I.

516
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:36,720
Use lots of time on Linux, just means I use less on my studies and on my work.

517
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,880
Did that cover everything.

518
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:48,920
OK, and I even have time for my girlfriend and cats occasionally.

519
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,050
Well, I'm.

520
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:00,600
We're teaching assistants at the university, which means.

521
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:09,480
Studying at least actually part of my work, so I can can say i'm working you, and when i'm working on Linux.

522
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,910
I'm also.

523
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:23,190
Sadly supposed to program something for me because of windows, which I have no clue at all about, but we'll see.

524
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:24,910
I gave

525
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:33,210
the Swedish small introduction to computers course last fall

526
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,780
So I I'm kind of a

527
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,560
do-it-all kind of guy.

528
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,180
Uh, what?

529
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,850
I don't know.

530
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:55,680
I didn't write it, but it's definitely commercial, something.

531
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,310
Like a 10000 dollar source license.

532
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:08,100
And then you have decision by the MIT folk wrote it. and whatever OSF folks, sorry, I don't know anything.

533
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,012
I'm just sit here,

534
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:15,550
question Andrew Potter, Rochester Institute of Technology.

535
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,770
I just thought i'd let you know some of the things that's happening with Linux.

536
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:30,140
Um, it's growing very rapidly, and its uses are just about anything that anyone uses a UNIX system for on an academic campus.

537
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:36,010
We've got people doing mosaic development and setting up a worldwide web server on it.

538
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:45,282
A large number of students have come on to the campus network with who are computer science programs and use SUNs in the

539
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:53,945
for their academic studies have have set up Linux on their their pcs in their dorms and their network,

540
00:54:53,945 --> 00:55:00,590
or they even using some of the network connectivity tools that are come with the

541
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:06,930
Slackware distribution um some of the network tools that have become that are very exciting is one.

542
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:13,690
Called term that a lot of users use, uh, it's a it's a poor means.

543
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:15,130
Let's.

544
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:24,720
Get the next best thing to SLIP connectivity where you actually log into a UNIX machine over a dialogue line asynchronously and come to the shell, prompt.

545
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:39,955
Start up this client program that essentially redirects ip sockets back to your own machine so that you can run IP applications on your own machine or TCP applications on your own machine,

546
00:55:39,955 --> 00:55:52,140
and they are redirected as if they are coming from the machine that you're on so that you can send X servers back or you can send the Mosaic equivalent Mosaic clients and a number of other things on your machines.

547
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,090
This is actually.

548
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,110
You know, a number of people are doing this at our site.

549
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:01,700
If people are using it for their mail engines, they're using it for you name it.

550
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:06,700
Whenever anyone uses a UNIX System IV in an academic environment.

551
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:09,950
Linux was doing it, and in many cases better.

552
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:17,070
Rick Tangan, Rocketdyne Division, Rockwell International.

553
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:24,300
One of our system administrators, has observed that he prefers the Linux interface to the HP-UX interface.

554
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:27,200
He says Linux is much more professional.

555
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,830
My question is.

556
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:31,730
What feature do you want to see next in Linux?

557
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,030
What's on your wish list.

558
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:38,950
I'll come to some of the Kernel features in my next talk.

559
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:40,010
Actually, I.

560
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:43,460
Really like to have a Windows emulator. Because

561
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,570
one of the things I miss.

562
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:56,100
Under Linux now I said it myself under Linux is that there is no good word processor there.

563
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:58,880
These slides.

564
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:10,960
I am ashamed to admit were done under windows, so I'd like to have a Windows emulator just to be able to do my slide on the one true operating system

565
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,510
Thank you.

566
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:17,870
Okay.

567
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:23,430
Okay.

568
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:32,490
Well, I guess if there's no more questions unless you want to take a quick break, okay, do you want to take a quick break two minutes.

569
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,580
2 minutes break in case somebody is.

570
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:39,810
Coming for the second talk 2 minutes break and do you need an escort again.

571
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:40,990
Or do we have your word, you'll come.

572
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:44,090
I'll come back

573
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:27,650
Okay.

574
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:36,780
I got, okay, they're.

575
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,880
[ inaudible ]

576
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,890
[ inaudible ]
