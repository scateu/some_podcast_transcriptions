EDL	00:01:10,320	00:01:10,950	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:01:10,950	00:01:16,090	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I mean, I take take it for granted that it's free and it's very open. 
EDL	00:01:16,090	00:01:21,090	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	If I were a marketing department I'd call it open Linux, [Laugh] but that's why not.

EDL	00:01:29,380	00:01:30,070	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	As I'm not. 
EDL	00:01:30,070	00:01:33,130	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I just call it Linux and tell you it's open. 
EDL	00:01:33,130	00:01:36,070	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And free, and it's written from scratch. 
EDL	00:01:36,070	00:01:39,250	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	So you don't have to pay AT&T or anything at all.

EDL	00:02:01,960	00:02:06,950	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And I run out of room, so I'll just try to tell you anyway, ah. 
EDL	00:02:06,950	00:02:07,410	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:02:07,410	00:02:08,530	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	The main thing about Linux. 
EDL	00:02:08,530	00:02:10,920	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 2.4 secs ]
EDL	00:02:10,920	00:02:18,310	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Is the good hardware support, it actually runs on more hardware than any other PC UNIX, that's at least my guess. 
EDL	00:02:18,310	00:02:18,620	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:02:18,620	00:02:20,030	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	SCO might be close. 
EDL	00:02:20,030	00:02:20,890	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:02:20,890	00:02:24,360	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Or it might be slightly better, but Linux

EDL	00:02:24,930	00:02:26,040	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	has drivers. 
EDL	00:02:26,040	00:02:39,420	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	For almost anything out there except the new stuff DEC puts in its PCs that we had terrible problems getting Linux running on the DEC PC or in the uh. 
EDL	00:02:39,420	00:02:41,240	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:02:41,240	00:02:48,120	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Whatever ya it also. 
EDL	00:02:48,120	00:02:49,080	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Has. 
EDL	00:02:49,080	00:02:50,440	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Support for lack of hardware. 
EDL	00:02:50,440	00:02:55,680	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	So if you don't have hardware like a co processor, it will emulate it. 
EDL	00:02:55,680	00:02:57,240	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

EDL	00:02:59,020	00:03:05,070	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	If you want to use something like DOS, which I suppose you don't, but if you want. 
EDL	00:03:05,070	00:03:05,580	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	To use it. 
EDL	00:03:05,580	00:03:10,900	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	You can use it together with Linux, either under the Linux. 
EDL	00:03:10,900	00:03:19,320	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	DOS simulator or side by side by rebooting into DOS, some model systems actually take over the whole disk.

EDL	00:03:19,820	00:03:23,610	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I think BSD .. 
EDL	00:03:23,610	00:03:25,620	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	They're early version certainly did.

EDL	00:03:29,750	00:03:40,560	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Uh, it's also very useful for personal use due to the low cost, low cost of the actual operating system, which is free. 
EDL	00:03:40,560	00:03:45,840	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And the low cost of the hardware it runs on, you can get an unbeatable
EDL	00:03:45,840	00:03:52,240	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	price performance system uh, it's also pretty expandable.

EDL	00:03:53,520	00:03:58,880	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Uh, due to the fact that you can .. if you're really hurting. 
EDL	00:03:58,880	00:04:00,950	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	You can write your own drivers and

EDL	00:04:58,180	00:05:02,540	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Academic use due to the fact that you have sources available. 
EDL	00:05:02,540	00:05:07,570	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	For now, additional costs and you can implement your own features. 
EDL	00:05:07,570	00:05:09,290	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	You can test out your theories. 
EDL	00:05:09,290	00:05:14,140	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I know Linux has been used in academia too

EDL	00:05:24,250	00:05:38,290	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Space machines they simulated, a 64-bit machine using Linux, and I know that somebody submitted the paper on it to [?] somewhere USENIX?
EDL	00:05:38,290	00:05:41,170	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Last year, I don't know if it was actually accepted.

* nicely said
EDL	00:05:43,400	00:05:49,240	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	But the largest reason for running Linux is technical superiority. 
EDL	00:05:49,240	00:05:52,640	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	It's simply better than anything out there in the world. 
EDL	00:05:52,640	00:05:54,390	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ] Laugh
EDL	00:05:54,390	00:05:57,700	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Ah, it's faster. 
EDL	00:05:57,700	00:06:01,670	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	It's smaller, it's [FIXME] mean or it slices dices, and so on. 
EDL	00:06:01,670	00:06:02,600	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:06:02,600	00:06:12,500	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	It runs endless loops in under 6 seconds or whatever works on everything and 
EDL	00:06:12,500	00:06:13,890	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:06:13,890	00:06:15,420	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And works very well. 
EDL	00:06:15,420	00:06:19,930	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Uh, I know people have started using Linux because it's free. 
EDL	00:06:19,930	00:06:20,850	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And so on. 
EDL	00:06:20,850	00:06:22,280	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:06:22,280	00:06:24,749	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	So it's the cheap alternative. 
EDL	00:06:24,749	00:06:29,089	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I also know people who have actually actually switched from a real UNIX
EDL	00:06:29,089	00:06:31,910	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	to Linux, because it's faster and it's more stable.

EDL	00:06:55,100	00:07:06,250	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	There's one Finland and uh, but obviously you can't call a 1 800 number and just ask for support. 
EDL	00:07:06,250	00:07:09,450	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	On the other hand, you do have support in electronic form.

MATHLAB is a computer algebra system created in 1964 by Carl Engelman at MITRE and written in Lisp.

"MATHLAB 68" was introduced in 1967[1] and became rather popular in university environments running on DECs PDP-6 and PDP-10 under TOPS-10 or TENEX. In 1969 this version was included in the DECUS user group's library (as 10-142) as royalty-free software.

EDL	00:14:50,530	00:14:51,450	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

EDL	00:14:51,450	00:14:58,426	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	So okay, once you've got the system running up and running and doing something, 
EDL	00:14:58,426	00:15:06,940	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	you have to actually have this time, you have to continue with it because there's gonna be
EDL	00:15:06,940	00:15:11,030	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	problems and you're going to hit your head against the wall
EDL	00:15:11,030	00:15:17,470	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	several times, so you'd better just keep on going, and then every once in a while,
EDL	00:15:17,470	00:15:19,470	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	You have to have some inspiration. 

EDL	00:15:19,470	00:15:22,740	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Ah, I can solve this problem this way. 

EDL	00:15:22,740	00:15:23,220	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:15:23,220	00:15:25,280	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	That's actually the smallest part, I think. 
EDL	00:15:25,280	00:15:30,150	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 4.9 secs ]
EDL	00:15:30,150	00:15:42,020	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Okay, over to some dates, ah, I bought my PC in early 1991. 
EDL	00:15:42,020	00:15:42,930	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:15:42,930	00:15:50,063	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	That was after having gone through a UNIX uh class at the university, 
EDL	00:15:50,063	00:16:01,680	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	so I had seen my first UNIX half a year before that, uh, I'm decided all at once that I wanted to use CUNIX? at home,
EDL	00:16:01,680	00:16:12,290	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	too. So I bought the Minix system and what I didn't start out to do was write an operating system. 
EDL	00:16:12,290	00:16:22,380	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Instead, Minix lacked terminal (?feature), so I wrote my own, and I actually wanted to test out my new machine at the same time. 
EDL	00:16:22,380	00:16:25,960	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	So I decided, okay, let's see, this machine has
EDL	00:16:25,960	00:16:28,560	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	multitasking capabilities in hardware. 
EDL	00:16:28,560	00:16:29,150	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:16:29,150	00:16:34,740	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	So let's do it by doing two tasks in the terminal emulator, quite like kermit does. 
EDL	00:16:34,740	00:16:36,480	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.7 secs ]
EDL	00:16:36,480	00:16:42,680	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	But we do it in hardware all the way, so I did a very simple program. 
EDL	00:16:42,680	00:16:43,520	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:16:43,520	00:16:45,590	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Well, actually, it's not very simple because the
EDL	00:16:45,590	00:16:55,550	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	386 protected mode hardware is very hard to actually program, that was a terminal emulation. 
EDL	00:16:55,550	00:16:57,790	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	That's where it all began and then. 
EDL	00:16:57,790	00:16:58,820	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:16:58,820	00:17:05,030	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I kind of added features, and soon it was the GNU Emacs of 
EDL	00:17:05,030	00:17:07,490	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	terminal emulators and I called it Linux. 
EDL	00:17:07,490	00:17:08,660	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:17:08,660	00:17:10,470	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	This was in. 
EDL	00:17:10,470	00:17:12,200	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Well, in. 
EDL	00:17:12,200	00:17:22,310	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	August 91 I actually had a system that leads something useful, so I made it public in September. 
EDL	00:17:22,310	00:17:23,800	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	To get some feedback. 
EDL	00:17:23,800	00:17:30,980	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And to be quite frank, at that point, it wasn't worth very much, it's booted, it ran a shell. 
EDL	00:17:30,980	00:17:31,640	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:17:31,640	00:17:38,510	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	It ran GCC, which was might .. kind of first milestone. 
EDL	00:17:38,510	00:17:46,290	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	But if you tried to compile a big program, it's crashed because the buffer handling didn't work out very well. 
EDL	00:17:46,290	00:17:47,650	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:17:47,650	00:17:47,660	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Uh. 
EDL	00:17:47,660	00:17:49,460	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]
EDL	00:17:49,460	00:17:52,170	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	So I kind of worked on that. 
EDL	00:17:52,170	00:17:52,710	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:17:52,710	00:17:57,170	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And by November 91. 
EDL	00:17:57,170	00:17:58,740	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	00:17:58,740	00:18:00,400	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Really worked very well. 
EDL	00:18:00,400	00:18:10,500	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And people who had used Minix's before were starting to switch over because Linux give things faster, work, better on past machines and so on. 
EDL	00:18:10,500	00:18:11,710	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:18:11,710	00:18:12,570	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	By that time. 
EDL	00:18:12,570	00:18:16,290	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I got the problem that I had 8 megs on memory. 
EDL	00:18:16,290	00:18:21,180	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Which was ampful? by my standards back then
EDL	00:18:21,180	00:18:28,415	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And could compile the kernel with no problems at all, but people who had smaller machines like just two megs 
EDL	00:18:28,415	00:18:40,284	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	also wanted to start playing this, and they couldn't compile the kernel because they didn't have enough space for for gcc, 
EDL	00:18:40,284	00:18:44,820	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	so just to get one of those people off my back. 
EDL	00:18:44,820	00:18:45,380	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:18:45,380	00:18:53,490	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I sat down and wrote the virtual memory in 3 days before Christmas, 91 ah. 
EDL	00:18:53,490	00:18:55,800	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 2.3 secs ]
EDL	00:18:55,800	00:18:57,870	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	It actually worked. 
EDL	00:18:57,870	00:19:06,900	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	But had so many bugs that the last one was found kind of half a year later, last or so, okay. 
EDL	00:19:06,900	00:19:08,700	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.8 secs ]

EDL	00:19:08,700	00:19:12,380	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Then in May of 92, we. 
EDL	00:19:12,380	00:19:18,401	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Actually got X11 released five working at that time, it was 
EDL	00:19:18,401	00:19:31,240	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	really a port(移植) of the official X consortium X11 code uh a month later, Linux got into the XFree86 projects. 
EDL	00:19:31,240	00:19:32,090	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:19:32,090	00:19:40,210	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	That's what we're using now, which is kind of it's X11 R5, but it's got lots of enhancements for the PC. 
EDL	00:19:40,210	00:19:42,790	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 2.6 secs ]
EDL	00:19:42,790	00:19:45,340	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And then I skip lots of things. 
EDL	00:19:45,340	00:19:52,670	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Networking got started with X, drivers got written and so on. 
EDL	00:19:52,670	00:19:53,020	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:19:53,020	00:19:57,300	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And this March, I released. 
EDL	00:19:57,300	00:19:58,730	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Version 1.0. 
EDL	00:19:58,730	00:20:00,210	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:20:00,210	00:20:00,540	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	All in all. 
EDL	00:20:00,540	00:20:12,260	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	It took a pretty exactly three years from from beginning of coding to 1.0, which is not too bad. 
EDL	00:20:12,260	00:20:16,510	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 4.2 secs ]
EDL	00:20:16,510	00:20:16,540	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Okay. 
EDL	00:20:16,540	00:20:19,400	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 2.9 secs ]
EDL	00:20:19,400	00:20:21,210	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I don't know what your reaction is. 

* Bill Gates of Finland?

EDL	00:20:21,210	00:20:24,860	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	But I know I get the question pretty often. 
EDL	00:20:24,860	00:20:29,550	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Why make it free, you could be the Bill Gates of Finland by now. 
EDL	00:20:29,550	00:20:36,940	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	If you hadn't it actually I struck off by answering, no. 
EDL	00:20:36,940	00:20:43,400	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I wouldn't, because if I hadn't made it free would never have developed as it has, 
EDL	00:20:43,400	00:20:50,150	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I probably had thought it's an interesting project and continued for half a year on it. 
EDL	00:20:50,150	00:20:51,020	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And then I'd say. 
EDL	00:20:51,020	00:20:54,616	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Okay, this is nice, and I had left. 
EDL	00:20:54,616	00:21:01,430	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Making it free and available for lots of people adds a lot to your motivation. 
EDL	00:21:01,430	00:21:01,920	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:21:01,920	00:21:05,730	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	You get kind of you, get the feed back. 
EDL	00:21:05,730	00:21:07,030	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:21:07,030	00:21:10,050	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	That motivates you to continue developing the system. 
EDL	00:21:10,050	00:21:12,830	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 2.8 secs ]
EDL	00:21:12,830	00:21:19,030	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Uh, I got lots of nails for the first few releases, which. 
EDL	00:21:19,030	00:21:21,350	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	were not really usable that they're kind of. 
EDL	00:21:21,350	00:21:22,600	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:21:22,600	00:21:29,350	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Still kept me going, and the feedback also results in in bug reports. 
EDL	00:21:29,350	00:21:30,140	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:21:30,140	00:21:33,940	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	So you fix the bugs faster, because you actually notice them. 
EDL	00:21:33,940	00:21:35,490	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:21:35,490	00:21:40,720	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Uh, it also results in lots of new ideas when I started out writing
EDL	00:21:40,720	00:21:46,750	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Linux I didn't know what a PTY was, and as I mentioned, I didn't know what select() was. 
EDL	00:21:46,750	00:21:47,490	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:21:47,490	00:21:50,850	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I was totally clueless about UNIX. 

EDL	00:21:50,850	00:21:56,160	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	And I got lots of good ideas from making it public and letting people say. 
EDL	00:21:56,160	00:21:58,720	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Hey, why doesn't this one support select()? 
EDL	00:21:58,720	00:21:59,560	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I'd like to use select()
EDL	00:21:59,560	00:22:00,410	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:22:00,410	00:22:05,188	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	I said, what? okay, so. 
EDL	00:22:05,188	00:22:16,850	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	also testing, especially on PC hardware testing, is a real problem because PC hardware is junk, the processor is good. 
EDL	00:22:16,850	00:22:19,080	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Actually, I like the 386. 
EDL	00:22:19,080	00:22:21,590	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	It has too few registers but 
EDL	00:22:21,590	00:22:26,240	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	it's a solid piece of hardware, otherwise, but the surrounding
EDL	00:22:26,240	00:22:27,130	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:22:27,130	00:22:34,180	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	hardware is very varied and do it doesn't always work the way it's supposed.
EDL	00:22:34,180	00:22:44,530	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	So when you do a PC port of UNIX, you are in for lots of surprises, and I think SUN 
EDL	00:22:44,530	00:22:51,837	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	noticed this with 386 Solaris, which I think is dead, maybe not officially, 
EDL	00:22:51,837	00:22:59,200	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	but it didn't seem to work on as many machines as they had hoped. 

EDL	00:22:59,200	00:23:12,070	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Also, not just testing, but people actually wrote drivers, so peripherals I couldn't even test because I didn't have them. 
EDL	00:23:12,070	00:23:19,630	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	Other people wrote drivers for and uh now Linux has drivers for something like
EDL	00:23:19,630	00:23:25,120	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	10 different SCSI uh controllers, of which I have just
EDL	00:23:25,120	00:23:27,640	| 199405DECUSNewOrleansLinusAnIntroductionToLinux |	one, and I didn't even need to write the driver for that.
