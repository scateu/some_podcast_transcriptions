EDL	00:28:37,260	00:29:09,840	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	you took over a little bit more than 10 years ago, right, widely perceived to be a transitional figure, you were not going to be number one you were you were going to spend a few years running the country and then somebody more decisive and somebody stronger and so forth who's going to take over but you confounded the skeptics you took charge and you're still very much in charge. 
EDL	00:29:09,840	00:29:15,087	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Why do you believe that perhaps you were underestimated.

EDL	00:29:39,640	00:29:56,260	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	I did not expect this. However, I've been in this position for 11 years, and I've always held a conviction that I need to do my very best to serve my country and my motherland, and maybe it was because of my hard work and my diligence that I still have the job.

EDL	00:30:26,630	00:30:36,430	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Is that one reason for your success or what does it mean? People use the same phrase to describe the character of Deng Xiaoping.

EDL	00:30:45,680	00:30:50,570	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	But that also would seem to mean you're a tough figure, a needle.

EDL	00:30:52,680	00:30:59,179	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	In fact, a needle wrapped in silk is a very high compliment in Chinese, so I think I should be more modest. 
EDL	00:30:59,179	00:31:15,463	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Outside we talked about relations between the United States and China in a few words, how would you characterize the state of relations between China and the United States today, mr. president.

EDL	00:31:44,200	00:31:51,580	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	There's no candor in it. In a recent headline in your government or one of your government newspapers, China Daily.

EDL	00:32:06,710	00:32:15,790	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	No, it's not a nice word, it's it's, still it's a diplomatic word in this case. 
EDL	00:32:15,790	00:32:26,560	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	In other words, look either you believe that the United States is a threat to world peace or you do not.

EDL	00:32:27,090	00:32:38,825	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Which is it and if so, in what way are we a threat to world peace, that was the headline when Defense Secretary William Cohen came here to China. 
EDL	00:32:38,825	00:32:41,740	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	I have a lot of friends in the United States.

EDL	00:32:50,730	00:33:02,637	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Maybe it is because of the strong economic power and the leading edge in science and technology that the United States enjoys that more often than not, it tends to overestimate itself and its position in the world. 
EDL	00:33:02,637	00:33:13,000	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Today I want to convey a friendly message to the American people, but I do want to say that there may be a certain touch of hegemonism in the leadership of the United States.

EDL	00:33:31,710	00:33:37,620	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	So if you permit, I would like to refrain from using too many tough words in our conversation. 
EDL	00:33:37,620	00:33:44,900	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	I think I made myself very clear when I said that the United States enjoyed a developed economy and also a leading edge in science and technology.

EDL	00:33:52,340	00:33:54,000	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	You mean we look down at China.

EDL	00:33:54,700	00:33:57,143	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	We are too prominent in Asia. 
EDL	00:33:57,143	00:34:10,910	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Well, I am not talking about the United States attitude toward China, in particular, China is a country with 5000 years of history and also more than 1.2 billion people.

EDL	00:34:11,460	00:34:21,380	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	We have accumulated a significant economic foundation over the past 20 years of reform and opening up, so I'm afraid the United States simply cannot afford to look down on China.

EDL	00:34:26,810	00:34:34,830	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	You studied the speeches of Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln as a youngster when you were learning English.

EDL	00:34:35,160	00:34:45,710	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Yeah, in fact I was in middle school and later when I was a teacher in the night school in Shanghai, I also selected Lincoln's Gettysburg Address as part of my course. 
EDL	00:34:45,710	00:34:46,860	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:34:46,860	00:34:49,620	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Maybe you want me to quote some lines from that speech. 
EDL	00:34:49,620	00:35:04,350	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	I do indeed. Four squirrel and a seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty to proposition that all men are created equal. 
EDL	00:35:04,350	00:35:04,930	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:35:04,930	00:35:28,290	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Why why did you learn that by heart. I'm particularly interested in the phrase all men are created equal that all men are created equal because this was a great influence on the students when I was in middle school and I think but Abraham Lincoln described in his article still remains the goal of American leaders today. 
EDL	00:35:28,290	00:35:28,780	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:35:28,780	00:35:42,150	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Especially the last paragraph, the government of the people by the people and the for the people never perish from the earth, but Abraham Lincoln was elected by the people. 
EDL	00:35:42,150	00:35:42,590	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:35:42,590	00:35:44,740	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	All right, that's right.

EDL	00:35:45,110	00:35:58,709	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Why is it that Americans can elect their national leaders, but you apparently don't trust the Chinese people to elect your national leaders, why? 
EDL	00:35:58,709	00:36:14,700	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	I also believe that I am an elected leader, although we use different ways of election, the only difference between China and the United States on this specific question is that different systems of election that we use in our two countries because China has its own historical tradition. 
EDL	00:36:14,700	00:36:19,730	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Its own level of education of economic development and social development and so on.

EDL	00:36:20,190	00:36:25,410	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	So I think each country should have its own individual system of election, of course. 
EDL	00:36:25,410	00:36:25,920	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

EDL	00:46:56,630	00:47:11,060	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	I hate corruption very much, but I don't think the problem and can be solved overnight and in order to gradually eradicate the problem, we need to depend on our legal system on our media and also on improved education.

EDL	00:47:11,590	00:47:17,830	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	You are right that during the disturbance of 89, some students were chanting slogans against corruption. 
EDL	00:47:17,830	00:47:23,550	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	So on this specific point, the party shares the same position with the students. 
EDL	00:47:23,550	00:47:35,830	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	But the fact is that there were some people with ulterior motives who were trying to use the enthusiasm of the students to overthrow the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and overthrow the socialist government.

EDL	00:48:22,562	00:48:33,936	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Because back then there was no freedom and democracy in the country, but ever since the people's republic of China was founded, we've always been working to further promote democracy in our country. 
EDL	00:48:33,936	00:48:37,850	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	Even in the 1989 disturbance, as I told you before.

EDL	00:52:47,920	00:53:00,540	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	One thing we have to make clear just now you mixed up two things. Christianity and Falun Gong under China's constitution, the Chinese people have the freedom of religious beliefs.

EDL	00:55:45,807	00:56:03,583	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	so I don't think it's appropriate for people to think that exchanges among scientists should have a problem unless some people were trying to achieve some political purpose up until today the Chinese still see Wen-Ho Li as a very well renowned scientist.

EDL	00:56:38,457	00:56:52,610	| President Jiang Interview-159079 |	the reason I ask about Wen-Ho Li is because I I met him and found him, but what do you think? and that's the scientist even with spy Chinese spy or not.
