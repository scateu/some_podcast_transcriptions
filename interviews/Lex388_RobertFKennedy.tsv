EDL	00:00:17,833	00:00:19,666	| kennedy |	I love science and engineering.
EDL	00:00:19,666	00:00:20,250	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

EDL	00:00:25,541	00:00:26,375	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:00:26,375	00:00:28,000	| kennedy |	Science is our journey,
EDL	00:00:28,000	00:00:28,458	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]

EDL	00:00:34,833	00:00:36,416	| kennedy |	the amount of suffering in the world.
EDL	00:00:36,416	00:00:37,291	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]

EDL	00:00:51,125	00:00:51,583	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:00:51,583	00:00:53,291	| kennedy |	without debate, both in the

EDL	00:01:06,791	00:01:09,208	| kennedy |	and arrogantly dismiss everything he says

EDL	00:01:12,625	00:01:13,000	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:01:13,000	00:01:14,166	| kennedy |	in the scientific process.

EDL	00:01:25,083	00:01:26,208	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:01:26,208	00:01:28,458	| kennedy |	I recommend that people read and listen

EDL	00:01:33,041	00:01:34,791	| kennedy |	But I also recommend, as I

EDL	00:01:36,291	00:01:37,333	| kennedy |	that people read and

EDL	00:01:53,916	00:01:56,083	| kennedy |	It is disagreement, not conformity,
EDL	00:01:56,083	00:01:56,708	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:01:56,708	00:01:58,541	| kennedy |	that bends the long arc of humanity

EDL	00:09:59,208	00:10:01,000	| kennedy |	I grew up very proud of this country

EDL	00:10:03,541	00:10:06,666	| kennedy |	in the sense that we were an example
EDL	00:10:06,666	00:10:09,500	| kennedy |	of democracy all over the world.
EDL	00:10:09,500	00:10:11,750	| kennedy |	When we first launched

EDL	00:10:14,625	00:10:16,291	| kennedy |	we were the only democracy on earth.

EDL	00:10:17,291	00:10:19,083	| kennedy |	And by the Civil War, by

EDL	00:10:26,875	00:10:28,125	| kennedy |	And all of them in one

EDL	00:10:32,250	00:10:34,750	| kennedy |	extraordinary because sort of

EDL	00:11:10,125	00:11:12,375	| kennedy |	And he said, we can't be

EDL	00:11:15,166	00:11:20,666	| kennedy |	or by the carnal

EDL	00:11:22,375	00:11:24,208	| kennedy |	We have to take this

EDL	00:11:42,583	00:11:42,958	| kennedy |	they adopted the land. And then 200 years

EDL	00:11:46,250	00:11:47,250	| kennedy |	they were mainly Deus.

EDL	00:11:47,708	00:11:48,666	| kennedy |	There were people who
EDL	00:11:48,666	00:11:52,916	| kennedy |	had a belief in God,
EDL	00:11:52,916	00:11:58,458	| kennedy |	but not so much a love of particularly

EDL	00:12:00,958	00:12:04,708	| kennedy |	The framers, the constitution believed

EDL	00:12:08,583	00:12:09,708	| kennedy |	around the world and
EDL	00:12:09,708	00:12:11,500	| kennedy |	that it was an example.

EDL	00:12:12,041	00:12:14,291	| kennedy |	In democracy, there
EDL	00:12:14,291	00:12:16,250	| kennedy |	would be this kind of wisdom
EDL	00:12:16,250	00:12:18,500	| kennedy |	from the collective, you know that.
EDL	00:12:18,500	00:12:18,833	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:12:18,833	00:12:19,833	| kennedy |	And the word wisdom means
EDL	00:12:19,833	00:12:21,166	| kennedy |	a knowledge of God's will.
EDL	00:12:21,166	00:12:22,375	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:12:22,375	00:12:23,916	| kennedy |	And that somehow God would
EDL	00:12:23,916	00:12:25,416	| kennedy |	speak through the collective
EDL	00:12:25,416	00:12:25,791	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:12:25,791	00:12:30,375	| kennedy |	in a way that he or she could not speak

EDL	00:12:34,041	00:12:36,125	| kennedy |	And I think that that's
EDL	00:12:36,125	00:12:37,875	| kennedy |	something that even though
EDL	00:12:37,875	00:12:39,041	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:12:39,041	00:12:41,125	| kennedy |	Winthrop was a white

EDL	00:12:48,708	00:12:50,125	| kennedy |	And I know my family, when,
EDL	00:12:50,125	00:12:52,000	| kennedy |	you know, my family came over,
EDL	00:12:52,000	00:12:54,500	| kennedy |	all of my grandparents came over in 1848

EDL	00:12:56,833	00:12:58,000	| kennedy |	And they saw this

EDL	00:12:59,625	00:13:02,625	| kennedy |	as something that was

EDL	00:13:07,666	00:13:09,500	| kennedy |	And so I'd say that

EDL	00:13:11,833	00:13:16,416	| kennedy |	that, you know, that's, I grew up so

EDL	00:13:17,500	00:13:18,958	| kennedy |	and believing that it
EDL	00:13:18,958	00:13:19,875	| kennedy |	was the greatest country
EDL	00:13:19,875	00:13:21,416	| kennedy |	in the world and for those reasons.

EDL	00:13:21,916	00:13:23,875	| kennedy |	- Well, I immigrated to this country.
EDL	00:13:23,875	00:13:25,458	| kennedy |	And one of the things that really
EDL	00:13:25,458	00:13:27,291	| kennedy |	embodies America to me
EDL	00:13:27,291	00:13:29,041	| kennedy |	is the ideal of freedom.

EDL	00:13:33,125	00:13:33,625	| kennedy |	What does freedom mean to you?
EDL	00:13:33,625	00:13:36,125	| kennedy |	- To me, freedom does
EDL	00:13:36,125	00:13:38,000	| kennedy |	not mean, you know, chaos.

EDL	00:13:39,125	00:13:40,500	| kennedy |	And it does not mean anarchy.

EDL	00:13:40,875	00:13:43,833	| kennedy |	It means that it has to

EDL	00:13:45,291	00:13:48,833	| kennedy |	if it's going to live up to

EDL	00:13:52,416	00:13:53,250	| kennedy |	What it means is the

EDL	00:14:20,500	00:14:21,458	| kennedy |	You know, Thomas Jefferson

EDL	00:15:36,500	00:15:40,208	| kennedy |	I suppose the way that Camus viewed the

EDL	00:15:42,416	00:15:43,750	| kennedy |	the Stoics did and a lot
EDL	00:15:43,750	00:15:47,416	| kennedy |	of the existentialists was that it was so
EDL	00:15:47,416	00:15:50,666	| kennedy |	absurd and that the
EDL	00:15:50,666	00:15:52,875	| kennedy |	problems and the tasks
EDL	00:15:52,875	00:15:54,666	| kennedy |	that were given just to live a life are
EDL	00:15:54,666	00:15:56,000	| kennedy |	so insurmountable,

EDL	00:15:56,416	00:15:58,458	| kennedy |	that the only way that we

EDL	00:16:01,875	00:16:07,000	| kennedy |	us this impossible
EDL	00:16:07,000	00:16:11,000	| kennedy |	task of living life was to
EDL	00:16:11,000	00:16:12,750	| kennedy |	embrace it and to enjoy it
EDL	00:16:12,750	00:16:14,916	| kennedy |	and to do our best at it.
EDL	00:16:14,916	00:16:15,375	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:16:15,375	00:16:19,500	| kennedy |	To me, I read Camus, particularly in the
EDL	00:16:19,500	00:16:25,708	| kennedy |	myth of Sisyphus, as a parable that—and
EDL	00:16:25,708	00:16:28,458	| kennedy |	it's the same lesson that I think he
EDL	00:16:28,458	00:16:29,875	| kennedy |	writes about in the
EDL	00:16:29,875	00:16:32,708	| kennedy |	plague, where we're all given
EDL	00:16:32,708	00:16:35,541	| kennedy |	these insurmountable tasks in our lives,
EDL	00:16:35,541	00:16:39,583	| kennedy |	but that by doing our
EDL	00:16:39,583	00:16:41,083	| kennedy |	duty, by being of service
EDL	00:16:41,083	00:16:45,000	| kennedy |	to others, we can bring meaning to a
EDL	00:16:45,000	00:16:47,208	| kennedy |	meaningless chaos and we can

EDL	00:16:50,833	00:16:55,000	| kennedy |	Sisyphus was kind of the iconic hero of
EDL	00:16:55,000	00:16:57,583	| kennedy |	the Stoics, and he was a
EDL	00:16:57,583	00:17:00,833	| kennedy |	man because he did something
EDL	00:17:00,833	00:17:01,333	| kennedy |	good.

EDL	00:17:04,291	00:17:06,208	| kennedy |	He angered the gods and they condemned

EDL	00:17:09,208	00:17:10,791	| kennedy |	then it would roll down.
EDL	00:17:10,791	00:17:12,208	| kennedy |	When he got to the top, it would roll
EDL	00:17:12,208	00:17:13,041	| kennedy |	down and he'd spend

EDL	00:17:14,625	00:17:16,208	| kennedy |	the hill to collect it and then rolling

EDL	00:17:17,625	00:17:19,166	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:17:19,166	00:17:20,541	| kennedy |	The task was absurd.
EDL	00:17:20,541	00:17:21,875	| kennedy |	It was insurmountable.

EDL	00:17:23,750	00:17:26,083	| kennedy |	But the last line of that book is one of
EDL	00:17:26,083	00:17:27,250	| kennedy |	the great lines, which
EDL	00:17:27,250	00:17:30,125	| kennedy |	is something to the extent
EDL	00:17:30,125	00:17:33,291	| kennedy |	that I can picture Sisyphus smiling,

EDL	00:17:34,166	00:17:36,375	| kennedy |	because Camus' belief was
EDL	00:17:36,375	00:17:39,166	| kennedy |	that even though his task
EDL	00:17:39,166	00:17:41,375	| kennedy |	was insurmountable, that he was a happy

EDL	00:17:43,333	00:17:44,500	| kennedy |	man because he put his

EDL	00:20:19,000	00:20:25,000	| kennedy |	Our nature has to be restrained, and that

EDL	00:20:28,333	00:20:31,500	| kennedy |	beauty of our country is that we devise
EDL	00:20:31,500	00:20:33,083	| kennedy |	these institutions that

EDL	00:20:49,000	00:20:51,166	| kennedy |	One of the other things that my father
EDL	00:20:51,166	00:20:53,833	| kennedy |	talked about from when I
EDL	00:20:53,833	00:20:55,500	| kennedy |	was little, he would ask
EDL	00:20:55,500	00:21:00,000	| kennedy |	us this question, "If you were the family
EDL	00:21:00,000	00:21:03,875	| kennedy |	and Frank came to your door and asked you
EDL	00:21:03,875	00:21:05,250	| kennedy |	to hide her, would you be
EDL	00:21:05,250	00:21:06,875	| kennedy |	one of the people who hid her?
EDL	00:21:06,875	00:21:09,125	| kennedy |	I risked your own life, or would you be
EDL	00:21:09,125	00:21:11,041	| kennedy |	one of the people who turned her in?"
EDL	00:21:11,041	00:21:12,416	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.4 secs ]
EDL	00:21:12,416	00:21:14,500	| kennedy |	Of course, we would all say, "Of course,
EDL	00:21:14,500	00:21:15,541	| kennedy |	we would hide and
EDL	00:21:15,541	00:21:16,958	| kennedy |	Frank and take the risk."

EDL	00:21:18,291	00:21:22,083	| kennedy |	But that's been something, kind of a
EDL	00:21:22,083	00:21:23,583	| kennedy |	lesson, a challenge that
EDL	00:21:23,583	00:21:26,500	| kennedy |	has always been near the
EDL	00:21:26,500	00:21:28,333	| kennedy |	forefront of my mind, that if a
EDL	00:21:28,333	00:21:32,333	| kennedy |	totalitarian system ever occurs in the
EDL	00:21:32,333	00:21:33,125	| kennedy |	United States, which
EDL	00:21:33,125	00:21:35,583	| kennedy |	my father thought was quite possible, he
EDL	00:21:35,583	00:21:37,458	| kennedy |	was conscious about how
EDL	00:21:37,458	00:21:39,833	| kennedy |	fragile democracy actually
EDL	00:21:39,833	00:21:43,500	| kennedy |	is, that would I be one of the ones who
EDL	00:21:43,500	00:21:44,791	| kennedy |	would resist the
EDL	00:21:44,791	00:21:47,083	| kennedy |	totalitarianism, or would I be
EDL	00:21:47,083	00:21:50,583	| kennedy |	one of the people who went along with it?
EDL	00:21:50,583	00:21:52,291	| kennedy |	Would I be one of the people who was at

EDL	00:22:07,125	00:22:08,500	| kennedy |	my head down and pretend
EDL	00:22:08,500	00:22:10,666	| kennedy |	I didn't see it because talking about it
EDL	00:22:10,666	00:22:12,833	| kennedy |	would be destructive
EDL	00:22:12,833	00:22:14,166	| kennedy |	to my career and maybe
EDL	00:22:14,166	00:22:15,958	| kennedy |	my freedom and even my life.

EDL	00:22:17,375	00:22:20,125	| kennedy |	So that has been a challenge that my
EDL	00:22:20,125	00:22:21,500	| kennedy |	father gave to me and all
EDL	00:22:21,500	00:22:22,875	| kennedy |	of my brothers and sisters,

EDL	00:22:37,291	00:22:39,750	| kennedy |	that human nature is such

EDL	00:26:30,000	00:26:31,083	| kennedy |	what they were going to do
EDL	00:26:31,083	00:26:32,833	| kennedy |	to end the Cuban missile crisis.
EDL	00:26:32,833	00:26:33,291	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:26:33,291	00:26:36,583	| kennedy |	And virtually, and of those men, 11 of
EDL	00:26:36,583	00:26:38,375	| kennedy |	them wanted to invade and
EDL	00:26:38,375	00:26:39,541	| kennedy |	wanted to bomb and invade.

EDL	00:26:41,291	00:26:44,041	| kennedy |	Then it was Jack, and then later on my

EDL	00:26:46,916	00:26:47,666	| kennedy |	who were the only people
EDL	00:26:47,666	00:26:51,083	| kennedy |	who were with him, because he was able to
EDL	00:26:51,083	00:26:52,458	| kennedy |	see the world from
EDL	00:26:52,458	00:26:54,125	| kennedy |	Khrushchev's point of view,

EDL	00:26:54,625	00:26:55,583	| kennedy |	he believed that there
EDL	00:26:55,583	00:26:57,041	| kennedy |	was another solution.
EDL	00:26:57,041	00:26:57,500	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:26:57,500	00:26:59,208	| kennedy |	And then he also had the moral courage.
EDL	00:26:59,208	00:27:00,000	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:27:00,000	00:27:03,166	| kennedy |	So my father, you know, to get back to
EDL	00:27:03,166	00:27:05,250	| kennedy |	your question, famously
EDL	00:27:05,250	00:27:07,791	| kennedy |	said that moral courage
EDL	00:27:07,791	00:27:09,750	| kennedy |	is the most important quality and it's
EDL	00:27:09,750	00:27:12,500	| kennedy |	more rare and courage
EDL	00:27:12,500	00:27:14,166	| kennedy |	on the football field or
EDL	00:27:14,166	00:27:16,333	| kennedy |	courage in battle than physical courage.
EDL	00:27:16,333	00:27:18,250	| kennedy |	It's much more difficult to come by, but
EDL	00:27:18,250	00:27:19,166	| kennedy |	it's the most important
EDL	00:27:19,166	00:27:20,541	| kennedy |	quality in a human being.
EDL	00:27:20,541	00:27:21,000	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:27:21,000	00:27:22,500	| kennedy |	And you think that kind of empathy that
EDL	00:27:22,500	00:27:23,583	| kennedy |	you referred to, that
EDL	00:27:23,583	00:27:24,791	| kennedy |	requires moral courage.
EDL	00:27:24,791	00:27:25,250	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:27:25,250	00:27:29,583	| kennedy |	It certainly requires moral courage to
EDL	00:27:29,583	00:27:32,500	| kennedy |	act on it, you know, and
EDL	00:27:32,500	00:27:33,750	| kennedy |	particularly, you know,
EDL	00:27:33,750	00:27:35,208	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:27:35,208	00:27:38,875	| kennedy |	any time that a nation is at war, there's
EDL	00:27:38,875	00:27:40,125	| kennedy |	kind of a momentum or
EDL	00:27:40,125	00:27:42,208	| kennedy |	an inertia that says,
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:43,875	| kennedy |	"Okay, let's not look at this from the
EDL	00:27:43,875	00:27:45,333	| kennedy |	other person's point of view."
EDL	00:27:45,333	00:27:46,791	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:27:46,791	00:27:48,916	| kennedy |	And that's the time we
EDL	00:27:48,916	00:27:50,083	| kennedy |	really need to do that.
EDL	00:27:50,083	00:27:50,666	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:27:50,666	00:27:53,666	| kennedy |	Well, if we can apply that style of
EDL	00:27:53,666	00:27:56,541	| kennedy |	empathy, style of curiosity to the
EDL	00:27:56,541	00:27:57,458	| kennedy |	current war in Ukraine,
EDL	00:27:57,458	00:27:58,666	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:27:58,666	00:28:00,625	| kennedy |	what is your understanding of why Russia
EDL	00:28:00,625	00:28:02,958	| kennedy |	invaded Ukraine in February 2022?
EDL	00:28:02,958	00:28:03,583	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:28:03,583	00:28:05,625	| kennedy |	Vladimir Putin could have
EDL	00:28:05,625	00:28:07,000	| kennedy |	avoided the war in the Ukraine.
EDL	00:28:07,000	00:28:08,000	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	00:28:08,000	00:28:10,083	| kennedy |	His invasion was illegal. It was
EDL	00:28:10,083	00:28:12,125	| kennedy |	unnecessary and it was brutal.
EDL	00:28:12,125	00:28:14,000	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.9 secs ]
EDL	00:28:14,000	00:28:19,166	| kennedy |	But I think it's important for us to move
EDL	00:28:19,166	00:28:20,208	| kennedy |	beyond these kind of
EDL	00:28:20,208	00:28:22,625	| kennedy |	comic book depictions of a,
EDL	00:28:22,625	00:28:27,958	| kennedy |	you know, of this insane, avaricious
EDL	00:28:27,958	00:28:31,125	| kennedy |	Russian leader who wants to
EDL	00:28:31,125	00:28:33,625	| kennedy |	restore the Soviet empire.
EDL	00:28:33,625	00:28:34,500	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:28:34,500	00:28:36,666	| kennedy |	And that that's why, and it was, and who
EDL	00:28:36,666	00:28:42,375	| kennedy |	made it unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.
EDL	00:28:42,375	00:28:45,750	| kennedy |	He was provoked. And we were provoking
EDL	00:28:45,750	00:28:46,375	| kennedy |	him, and we were
EDL	00:28:46,375	00:28:48,875	| kennedy |	provoking him for since 1997.
EDL	00:28:48,875	00:28:50,333	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	00:28:50,333	00:28:52,625	| kennedy |	And it's not just me that's saying that.
EDL	00:28:52,625	00:28:55,000	| kennedy |	I mean, when, and
EDL	00:28:55,000	00:28:57,500	| kennedy |	before Putin ever came in,
EDL	00:28:57,500	00:28:58,208	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:28:58,208	00:29:00,500	| kennedy |	we were provoking Russians in this way
EDL	00:29:00,500	00:29:03,000	| kennedy |	unnecessarily. And to
EDL	00:29:03,000	00:29:04,041	| kennedy |	go back that time in
EDL	00:29:04,041	00:29:07,083	| kennedy |	1992, when the Russians moved out of when
EDL	00:29:07,083	00:29:08,875	| kennedy |	the Soviet Union was collapsing,
EDL	00:29:08,875	00:29:10,083	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:29:10,083	00:29:12,541	| kennedy |	the Russians moved out of East Germany.

EDL	00:29:13,166	00:29:13,958	| kennedy |	And they did that, which
EDL	00:29:13,958	00:29:15,041	| kennedy |	was a huge concession to them.
EDL	00:29:15,041	00:29:17,291	| kennedy |	They had 400,000 troops in East Germany
EDL	00:29:17,291	00:29:18,291	| kennedy |	at that time, and they
EDL	00:29:18,291	00:29:19,458	| kennedy |	were facing NATO troops

EDL	00:29:22,000	00:29:23,791	| kennedy |	Okorbutchev made this huge concession
EDL	00:29:23,791	00:29:25,833	| kennedy |	where he said to George Bush,
EDL	00:29:25,833	00:29:27,041	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	00:29:27,041	00:29:28,833	| kennedy |	I'm going to move all of our troops out
EDL	00:29:28,833	00:29:29,708	| kennedy |	and you can then
EDL	00:29:29,708	00:29:32,208	| kennedy |	reunify Germany under NATO,
EDL	00:29:32,208	00:29:34,750	| kennedy |	which was a hostile army to the, to the,

EDL	00:29:38,208	00:29:39,708	| kennedy |	with hostile intent toward the Soviet
EDL	00:29:39,708	00:29:43,291	| kennedy |	Union. And he said, you can take Germany,
EDL	00:29:43,291	00:29:45,375	| kennedy |	but I want your promise that you will not
EDL	00:29:45,375	00:29:46,791	| kennedy |	move NATO to the East.
EDL	00:29:46,791	00:29:48,166	| kennedy |	And James Baker, who was a
EDL	00:29:48,166	00:29:51,250	| kennedy |	Secretary of State, famously said, I will
EDL	00:29:51,250	00:29:53,000	| kennedy |	not move NATO. We will not
EDL	00:29:53,000	00:29:54,791	| kennedy |	move NATO one inch to the East.

EDL	00:29:55,333	00:29:59,333	| kennedy |	So then five years later, in 1997, the

EDL	00:30:44,250	00:30:47,041	| kennedy |	unnecessary. And if you do this, it's
EDL	00:30:47,041	00:30:48,250	| kennedy |	going to provoke the

EDL	00:38:49,833	00:38:51,583	| kennedy |	there's probably corruption in his

EDL	00:40:32,916	00:40:35,000	| kennedy |	we should actually be

EDL	00:41:05,875	00:41:07,250	| kennedy |	president can play a really

EDL	00:45:29,000	00:45:30,750	| kennedy |	to the Russian side. We've seen this
EDL	00:45:30,750	00:45:31,750	| kennedy |	again and again, again,
EDL	00:45:31,750	00:45:33,666	| kennedy |	including platoon size groups that
EDL	00:45:33,666	00:45:37,833	| kennedy |	are defecting to the Russians. And, um, I
EDL	00:45:37,833	00:45:38,833	| kennedy |	don't think it's possible
EDL	00:45:38,833	00:45:41,208	| kennedy |	to win and anybody, you know,
EDL	00:45:41,208	00:45:44,416	| kennedy |	I saw, I, of course I've studied world

EDL	00:45:45,375	00:45:49,958	| kennedy |	exhaustively, but I saw a, um, there's a
EDL	00:45:49,958	00:45:52,541	| kennedy |	new, I think it's a Netflix series of
EDL	00:45:52,541	00:45:53,791	| kennedy |	documentaries that I highly
EDL	00:45:53,791	00:45:55,291	| kennedy |	recommend to people there. It's,
EDL	00:45:55,291	00:45:57,375	| kennedy |	they're colorized versions of the black
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:46:00,916	| kennedy |	and white, um, films from
EDL	00:46:00,916	00:46:02,208	| kennedy |	the battles of world war two,
EDL	00:46:02,208	00:46:03,541	| kennedy |	but it's all the battles of world war
EDL	00:46:03,541	00:46:06,333	| kennedy |	two. So I watched it all in grad the

EDL	00:46:08,083	00:46:10,291	| kennedy |	you know, the, the willingness of the

EDL	00:46:25,000	00:46:27,125	| kennedy |	do that for their motherland is almost
EDL	00:46:27,125	00:46:28,541	| kennedy |	inexhaustible. It is
EDL	00:46:28,541	00:46:32,541	| kennedy |	incomprehensible to think that the, uh,
EDL	00:46:32,541	00:46:34,833	| kennedy |	that Ukraine can, can beat
EDL	00:46:34,833	00:46:36,125	| kennedy |	Russia in a war. It would
EDL	00:46:36,125	00:46:38,625	| kennedy |	be like Mexico beating the United States.
EDL	00:46:38,625	00:46:40,583	| kennedy |	It's just, it's impossible
EDL	00:46:40,583	00:46:42,208	| kennedy |	to think that it can happen.
EDL	00:46:42,208	00:46:45,458	| kennedy |	And, you know, Russia has, has deployed a
EDL	00:46:45,458	00:46:47,250	| kennedy |	tiny, tiny fraction of its
EDL	00:46:47,250	00:46:49,500	| kennedy |	military so far. And, uh,
EDL	00:46:49,500	00:46:52,708	| kennedy |	you know, now it has China with its mass
EDL	00:46:52,708	00:46:53,750	| kennedy |	production capacity,
EDL	00:46:53,750	00:46:55,750	| kennedy |	supporting its war effort.
EDL	00:46:55,750	00:46:58,500	| kennedy |	It's just, it's a, it's a hopeless

EDL	00:46:59,916	00:47:01,708	| kennedy |	lied to, you know, we're the,
EDL	00:47:01,708	00:47:03,500	| kennedy |	the press in our country and our

EDL	00:47:06,000	00:47:07,333	| kennedy |	promoting this lie that
EDL	00:47:07,333	00:47:09,708	| kennedy |	the Ukrainian is about to win and that
EDL	00:47:09,708	00:47:11,208	| kennedy |	everything's going great and
EDL	00:47:11,208	00:47:13,583	| kennedy |	that Putin's on the run. And
EDL	00:47:13,583	00:47:15,625	| kennedy |	there's all this wishful thinking because
EDL	00:47:15,625	00:47:17,958	| kennedy |	of the Wagner group,
EDL	00:47:17,958	00:47:18,291	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	00:47:18,291	00:47:19,750	| kennedy |	you know, the, the, the
EDL	00:47:19,750	00:47:21,750	| kennedy |	Gorgosia and the Wagner group that this
EDL	00:47:21,750	00:47:23,666	| kennedy |	was an internal coup and it showed
EDL	00:47:23,666	00:47:24,708	| kennedy |	dissent and weakness
EDL	00:47:24,708	00:47:27,166	| kennedy |	of Putin. And none of that is true. I was
EDL	00:47:27,166	00:47:30,875	| kennedy |	a, that insurgency, which
EDL	00:47:30,875	00:47:32,000	| kennedy |	wasn't even an insurgency,
EDL	00:47:32,000	00:47:34,500	| kennedy |	only got 4,000 of his, of his men to
EDL	00:47:34,500	00:47:37,208	| kennedy |	follow him out of 20,000. And
EDL	00:47:37,208	00:47:38,416	| kennedy |	they were quickly stopped and
EDL	00:47:38,416	00:47:40,125	| kennedy |	nobody in the Russian military, the
EDL	00:47:40,125	00:47:42,083	| kennedy |	oligarchy, the political system, nobody
EDL	00:47:42,083	00:47:43,458	| kennedy |	supported it, you know,
EDL	00:47:43,458	00:47:45,541	| kennedy |	and by we're being told, Oh yeah, it's
EDL	00:47:45,541	00:47:47,333	| kennedy |	the beginning of the end for blue Putin.

EDL	00:47:51,833	00:47:53,583	| kennedy |	things are just lies that we are
EDL	00:47:53,583	00:47:56,583	| kennedy |	being fed. So pushback on a small aspect
EDL	00:47:56,583	00:47:57,916	| kennedy |	of this that you kind of
EDL	00:47:57,916	00:47:59,375	| kennedy |	implied. So I've traveled to
EDL	00:47:59,375	00:48:02,791	| kennedy |	Ukraine and one thing that I should say,
EDL	00:48:02,791	00:48:03,833	| kennedy |	similar to the battle of
EDL	00:48:03,833	00:48:06,333	| kennedy |	Stalingrad, it is just not,
EDL	00:48:06,333	00:48:06,916	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	00:48:06,916	00:48:08,625	| kennedy |	it is not only the Russians that fight to
EDL	00:48:08,625	00:48:11,125	| kennedy |	the end. I think Ukrainian is a very
EDL	00:48:11,125	00:48:13,291	| kennedy |	to fight to the end. And the morale there
EDL	00:48:13,291	00:48:17,125	| kennedy |	is quite high. I've talked to nobody,
EDL	00:48:17,125	00:48:17,791	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:48:17,791	00:48:19,583	| kennedy |	this was a year ago in August with her
EDL	00:48:19,583	00:48:22,125	| kennedy |	son, everybody was proud
EDL	00:48:22,125	00:48:23,333	| kennedy |	to fight and die for their
EDL	00:48:23,333	00:48:25,000	| kennedy |	country. And there's some aspect where
EDL	00:48:25,000	00:48:26,791	| kennedy |	this war unified the people
EDL	00:48:26,791	00:48:29,458	| kennedy |	to get gave them a reason and
EDL	00:48:29,458	00:48:31,166	| kennedy |	an understanding that this is what it
EDL	00:48:31,166	00:48:32,333	| kennedy |	means to be Ukrainian. And
EDL	00:48:32,333	00:48:33,375	| kennedy |	I will fight to the death.
EDL	00:48:33,375	00:48:33,875	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:48:33,875	00:48:37,000	| kennedy |	I would agree with that. And I should
EDL	00:48:37,000	00:48:39,000	| kennedy |	have said that myself at the beginning,
EDL	00:48:39,000	00:48:39,666	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:48:39,666	00:48:42,875	| kennedy |	that's the reason my son went over there
EDL	00:48:42,875	00:48:45,458	| kennedy |	to fight because he was inspired by the
EDL	00:48:45,458	00:48:47,875	| kennedy |	valor of the Ukrainian people and this
EDL	00:48:47,875	00:48:48,458	| kennedy |	extraordinary
EDL	00:48:48,458	00:48:50,250	| kennedy |	willingness of them. And I think
EDL	00:48:50,250	00:48:52,083	| kennedy |	Putin thought it would be much easier to
EDL	00:48:52,083	00:48:53,291	| kennedy |	sweep into Ukraine. And
EDL	00:48:53,291	00:48:55,958	| kennedy |	he found a stone wall of
EDL	00:48:55,958	00:48:57,875	| kennedy |	Ukrainians, whether ready to put their
EDL	00:48:57,875	00:49:00,750	| kennedy |	lives and their bodies on the line. But
EDL	00:49:00,750	00:49:01,958	| kennedy |	that to me makes the
EDL	00:49:01,958	00:49:02,333	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	00:49:02,333	00:49:09,750	| kennedy |	whole episode even more tragic. I think
EDL	00:49:09,750	00:49:12,500	| kennedy |	that the US role in this
EDL	00:49:12,500	00:49:17,291	| kennedy |	has been, there were many
EDL	00:49:17,291	00:49:20,250	| kennedy |	opportunities to settle this war and the
EDL	00:49:20,250	00:49:21,375	| kennedy |	Ukrainians wanted to settle
EDL	00:49:21,375	00:49:23,041	| kennedy |	it. Vladimir Zelensky, when he
EDL	00:49:23,041	00:49:25,708	| kennedy |	ran in 2019, here's a guy who's a
EDL	00:49:25,708	00:49:30,791	| kennedy |	comedian. He's an actor. He had no
EDL	00:49:30,791	00:49:32,166	| kennedy |	political experience and yet he
EDL	00:49:32,166	00:49:34,416	| kennedy |	won this election with 70% of the vote.
EDL	00:49:34,416	00:49:35,625	| kennedy |	Why? He won on a peace

EDL	00:49:41,625	00:49:43,250	| kennedy |	happened when he got in there
EDL	00:49:43,250	00:49:44,708	| kennedy |	that made him suddenly pivot.

EDL	00:49:45,625	00:49:49,000	| kennedy |	And I think it's a good guess what
EDL	00:49:49,000	00:49:52,791	| kennedy |	happened. I think he came under threat by
EDL	00:49:52,791	00:49:55,000	| kennedy |	ultra-naturalist nationalists within his
EDL	00:49:55,000	00:50:00,083	| kennedy |	own administration. And the insistence of

EDL	00:50:02,125	00:50:05,541	| kennedy |	White House that we don't want peace with

EDL	00:50:13,000	00:50:14,583	| kennedy |	It seems like a silly question, but it's

EDL	00:50:17,333	00:50:23,208	| kennedy |	The reason it's not is just because
EDL	00:50:23,208	00:50:25,875	| kennedy |	people seem to be in this kind of dream
EDL	00:50:25,875	00:50:26,958	| kennedy |	state about that it'll

EDL	00:50:41,291	00:50:42,791	| kennedy |	Putin, if he felt like

EDL	00:51:13,666	00:51:17,333	| kennedy |	I have very strong memories of the Cuban

EDL	00:51:21,291	00:51:24,083	| kennedy |	when we came closer to nuclear war, and
EDL	00:51:24,083	00:51:26,083	| kennedy |	particularly I think it was when the U2
EDL	00:51:26,083	00:51:31,750	| kennedy |	got shut down over Cuba, and nobody in

EDL	00:52:32,416	00:52:34,916	| kennedy |	eight. My father was spending
EDL	00:52:34,916	00:52:36,416	| kennedy |	the night at the White House. He wasn't
EDL	00:52:36,416	00:52:37,708	| kennedy |	coming home. He was

EDL	00:52:39,458	00:52:41,666	| kennedy |	and sleeping there. And they were up 24

EDL	00:52:42,916	00:52:44,500	| kennedy |	debating and trying to figure
EDL	00:52:44,500	00:52:49,250	| kennedy |	out what was happening. But we had U.S.

EDL	00:52:51,375	00:52:52,250	| kennedy |	down. They were going
EDL	00:52:52,250	00:52:56,458	| kennedy |	to take us down to White Sulphur Springs

EDL	00:53:02,083	00:53:07,291	| kennedy |	where there was an underground city,
EDL	00:53:07,291	00:53:09,041	| kennedy |	essentially, a bunker that was like a

EDL	00:53:10,333	00:53:12,375	| kennedy |	it had McDonald's in it and a lot of

EDL	00:53:15,083	00:53:18,333	| kennedy |	their families. U.S. Marshals came to our

EDL	00:53:19,291	00:53:21,125	| kennedy |	there. And I was very excited
EDL	00:53:21,125	00:53:22,958	| kennedy |	about doing that. And this was at a time
EDL	00:53:22,958	00:53:24,416	| kennedy |	when we were doing the

EDL	00:53:34,375	00:53:37,291	| kennedy |	then you put your head onto the table.

EDL	00:53:43,250	00:53:44,458	| kennedy |	and you wait. And the
EDL	00:53:44,458	00:53:46,250	| kennedy |	initial blast will take the windows
EDL	00:53:46,250	00:53:48,500	| kennedy |	out of the school. And then we all stand
EDL	00:53:48,500	00:53:50,541	| kennedy |	up and file in an orderly

EDL	00:54:50,333	00:54:52,500	| kennedy |	and he talked to us on the phone
EDL	00:54:52,500	00:54:55,333	| kennedy |	and he said, "I don't want you going down
EDL	00:54:55,333	00:54:59,166	| kennedy |	there because if you
EDL	00:54:59,166	00:55:01,125	| kennedy |	disappear from school, people are

EDL	00:55:06,916	00:55:08,541	| kennedy |	he said something to me
EDL	00:55:08,541	00:55:12,083	| kennedy |	during that period, which was that if the
EDL	00:55:12,083	00:55:13,416	| kennedy |	nuclear war happened, it
EDL	00:55:13,416	00:55:15,166	| kennedy |	would be better to be among the

EDL	00:55:17,541	00:55:20,083	| kennedy |	believe. Okay. I mean, I had already
EDL	00:55:20,083	00:55:22,250	| kennedy |	prepared myself for the

EDL	00:55:22,875	00:55:26,250	| kennedy |	dystopian future and I knew I could... I
EDL	00:55:26,250	00:55:27,791	| kennedy |	spent every day in the woods.
EDL	00:55:27,791	00:55:29,458	| kennedy |	I knew that I could survive by
EDL	00:55:29,458	00:55:32,791	| kennedy |	catching crawfish and cooking mud puppies
EDL	00:55:32,791	00:55:34,666	| kennedy |	and do whatever I had
EDL	00:55:34,666	00:55:36,375	| kennedy |	to do. But I felt like,
EDL	00:55:36,375	00:55:40,875	| kennedy |	okay, I can handle this. And I really
EDL	00:55:40,875	00:55:42,083	| kennedy |	wanted to see the setup

EDL	00:55:53,125	00:55:55,875	| kennedy |	my father got this idea because

EDL	00:55:56,958	00:55:59,583	| kennedy |	letters. He sent one letter that was

EDL	00:56:09,041	00:56:10,375	| kennedy |	it, they sent another letter that was
EDL	00:56:10,375	00:56:11,500	| kennedy |	extremely belligerent.

EDL	00:56:12,916	00:56:15,625	| kennedy |	And my father had the idea, let's just
EDL	00:56:15,625	00:56:17,208	| kennedy |	pretend we didn't get the
EDL	00:56:17,208	00:56:18,500	| kennedy |	second letter and reply to the
EDL	00:56:18,500	00:56:22,333	| kennedy |	first one. And then he went down to
EDL	00:56:22,333	00:56:25,458	| kennedy |	Dobrennan and who was... he
EDL	00:56:25,458	00:56:26,833	| kennedy |	met Dobrennan in the Justice

EDL	00:56:31,416	00:56:34,000	| kennedy |	proposed this settlement,

EDL	00:56:40,791	00:56:42,375	| kennedy |	had put the missiles in Cuba because we
EDL	00:56:42,375	00:56:43,250	| kennedy |	had put missiles,

EDL	00:56:46,666	00:56:49,708	| kennedy |	Italy. And my uncle's secret deal was
EDL	00:56:49,708	00:56:51,583	| kennedy |	that if Khrushchev
EDL	00:56:51,583	00:56:54,000	| kennedy |	removed the missiles from Cuba,
EDL	00:56:54,000	00:56:56,041	| kennedy |	within six months, he would get rid of

EDL	00:57:11,500	00:57:12,750	| kennedy |	my uncle complied with it.

EDL	00:57:20,833	00:57:22,375	| kennedy |	of course is the perennial question,
EDL	00:57:22,375	00:57:23,500	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	00:57:23,500	00:57:28,166	| kennedy |	but is history kind of an automatic pilot
EDL	00:57:28,166	00:57:32,041	| kennedy |	and human decisions, decisions of leaders
EDL	00:57:32,041	00:57:33,375	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	00:57:33,375	00:57:36,833	| kennedy |	really only have a marginal or
EDL	00:57:36,833	00:57:38,208	| kennedy |	incremental bearing on what
EDL	00:57:38,208	00:57:39,625	| kennedy |	is going to happen anyway.
EDL	00:57:39,625	00:57:42,000	| kennedy |	But I think that is the... and historians
EDL	00:57:42,000	00:57:43,333	| kennedy |	argue about that all the
EDL	00:57:43,333	00:57:45,791	| kennedy |	time. I think that that is
EDL	00:57:45,791	00:57:50,208	| kennedy |	a really good example of a place in human
EDL	00:57:50,208	00:57:52,583	| kennedy |	history that literally the
EDL	00:57:52,583	00:57:53,666	| kennedy |	world could have ended if
EDL	00:57:53,666	00:57:54,541	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	00:57:54,541	00:57:55,791	| kennedy |	we had a different leader in the White
EDL	00:57:55,791	00:57:57,291	| kennedy |	House. And the reason for
EDL	00:57:57,291	00:57:59,708	| kennedy |	that is that there were,
EDL	00:57:59,708	00:58:03,625	| kennedy |	as I recall, 64 gun emplacements, missile
EDL	00:58:03,625	00:58:07,375	| kennedy |	emplacements. Each one of
EDL	00:58:07,375	00:58:08,500	| kennedy |	those missile emplacements
EDL	00:58:08,500	00:58:12,000	| kennedy |	had a crew of about 100 men and they were
EDL	00:58:12,000	00:58:15,125	| kennedy |	Soviets. So they were...
EDL	00:58:15,125	00:58:15,666	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:58:15,666	00:58:18,625	| kennedy |	and we didn't know whether...
EDL	00:58:18,625	00:58:19,375	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:58:19,375	00:58:21,458	| kennedy |	we had a couple of questions that my
EDL	00:58:21,458	00:58:26,666	| kennedy |	uncle asked the CIA and he asked...
EDL	00:58:26,666	00:58:27,750	| kennedy |	Douglas was already gone,
EDL	00:58:27,750	00:58:30,541	| kennedy |	but he asked the CIA and he asked his
EDL	00:58:30,541	00:58:32,541	| kennedy |	military brass because
EDL	00:58:32,541	00:58:33,541	| kennedy |	they all wanted to go in.
EDL	00:58:33,541	00:58:34,041	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:58:34,041	00:58:35,583	| kennedy |	Everybody wanted to go in and my uncle
EDL	00:58:35,583	00:58:37,333	| kennedy |	said, my uncle asked
EDL	00:58:37,333	00:58:38,708	| kennedy |	to see the aerial photos
EDL	00:58:38,708	00:58:39,208	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:58:39,208	00:58:41,375	| kennedy |	and he examined those personally. And
EDL	00:58:41,375	00:58:42,958	| kennedy |	that's why it's important to have a
EDL	00:58:42,958	00:58:43,750	| kennedy |	leader in the White House
EDL	00:58:43,750	00:58:46,208	| kennedy |	who can push back on their bureaucracies.
EDL	00:58:46,208	00:58:48,833	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 2.6 secs ]
EDL	00:58:48,833	00:58:51,166	| kennedy |	And then he asked them,
EDL	00:58:51,166	00:58:54,083	| kennedy |	you know, who's manning those
EDL	00:58:54,083	00:58:57,208	| kennedy |	missile sites and are they Russians? And
EDL	00:58:57,208	00:58:59,166	| kennedy |	if they're Russians and we bomb them,
EDL	00:58:59,166	00:59:00,000	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	00:59:00,000	00:59:05,291	| kennedy |	isn't it going to force Khrushchev to
EDL	00:59:05,291	00:59:08,541	| kennedy |	then go into Berlin? And
EDL	00:59:08,541	00:59:09,750	| kennedy |	that would be the beginning of
EDL	00:59:09,750	00:59:13,125	| kennedy |	a cascade of facts that would highly like
EDL	00:59:13,125	00:59:13,916	| kennedy |	to end a nuclear
EDL	00:59:13,916	00:59:19,333	| kennedy |	confrontation. And the military brass
EDL	00:59:19,333	00:59:20,833	| kennedy |	said to my uncle, oh, we don't think
EDL	00:59:20,833	00:59:26,166	| kennedy |	he'll have the guts to do that. So he
EDL	00:59:26,166	00:59:26,375	| kennedy |	was... my uncle was like,
EDL	00:59:26,375	00:59:26,875	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	00:59:26,875	00:59:31,458	| kennedy |	that's what you're betting on. And, you
EDL	00:59:31,458	00:59:32,541	| kennedy |	know, they all wanted him to
EDL	00:59:32,541	00:59:34,291	| kennedy |	go in. They wanted him to bomb
EDL	00:59:34,291	00:59:37,583	| kennedy |	the sites and then invade Cuba. And he
EDL	00:59:37,583	00:59:38,541	| kennedy |	said, if we bomb those
EDL	00:59:38,541	00:59:39,500	| kennedy |	sites, we're going to be killing
EDL	00:59:39,500	00:59:42,250	| kennedy |	Russians and it's going to force... it's
EDL	00:59:42,250	00:59:44,500	| kennedy |	going to provoke Russia into some
EDL	00:59:44,500	00:59:45,791	| kennedy |	response. And the obvious
EDL	00:59:45,791	00:59:47,625	| kennedy |	response is for them to go into Berlin.
EDL	00:59:47,625	00:59:48,291	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	00:59:48,291	00:59:50,625	| kennedy |	Oh, but the thing that we didn't know then,
EDL	00:59:50,625	00:59:55,208	| kennedy |	that we didn't find out until I think,
EDL	00:59:55,208	00:59:56,708	| kennedy |	you know, there was a, there
EDL	00:59:56,708	00:59:58,541	| kennedy |	was like a 30 year anniversary
EDL	00:59:58,541	01:00:00,833	| kennedy |	of the Cuban Missile Crisis in Havana.
EDL	01:00:00,833	01:00:02,166	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	01:00:02,166	01:00:06,291	| kennedy |	And what we learned then was that from
EDL	01:00:06,291	01:00:07,791	| kennedy |	the Russians who came
EDL	01:00:07,791	01:00:08,708	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	01:00:08,708	01:00:10,791	| kennedy |	to that event, it was like a symposium
EDL	01:00:10,791	01:00:12,083	| kennedy |	where everybody on both
EDL	01:00:12,083	01:00:13,666	| kennedy |	sides talked about it. And we
EDL	01:00:13,666	01:00:15,708	| kennedy |	learned a lot of stuff that I never,
EDL	01:00:15,708	01:00:18,708	| kennedy |	nobody knew before. One of the insane
EDL	01:00:18,708	01:00:20,000	| kennedy |	things, the most insane
EDL	01:00:20,000	01:00:21,916	| kennedy |	thing that we learned was that the
EDL	01:00:21,916	01:00:24,916	| kennedy |	weapons were already, the nuclear
EDL	01:00:24,916	01:00:26,166	| kennedy |	warheads were already in
EDL	01:00:26,166	01:00:29,666	| kennedy |	place. They were ready to fire. And that
EDL	01:00:29,666	01:00:31,166	| kennedy |	the authorization to
EDL	01:00:31,166	01:00:35,750	| kennedy |	fire was made, was delegated
EDL	01:00:35,750	01:00:39,583	| kennedy |	to each of the gun crew commanders. So
EDL	01:00:39,583	01:00:42,875	| kennedy |	there were 60 people who at all had
EDL	01:00:42,875	01:00:44,166	| kennedy |	authorization to fire if
EDL	01:00:44,166	01:00:47,541	| kennedy |	they felt themselves under attack. So you
EDL	01:00:47,541	01:00:48,958	| kennedy |	have to believe that at
EDL	01:00:48,958	01:00:50,000	| kennedy |	least one of them would have
EDL	01:00:50,000	01:00:51,666	| kennedy |	launched and that would have been the
EDL	01:00:51,666	01:00:53,500	| kennedy |	beginning of the end. And, you know, if
EDL	01:00:53,500	01:00:55,000	| kennedy |	anybody had launched,
EDL	01:00:55,000	01:00:55,708	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	01:00:55,708	01:00:58,000	| kennedy |	you know, we knew what would happen. My
EDL	01:00:58,000	01:00:58,750	| kennedy |	uncle knew what would
EDL	01:00:58,750	01:01:01,125	| kennedy |	happen. Because he asked again and
EDL	01:01:01,125	01:01:03,375	| kennedy |	again, what's going to happen? And they
EDL	01:01:03,375	01:01:06,125	| kennedy |	said, 30 million Americans will be
EDL	01:01:06,125	01:01:09,375	| kennedy |	killed, but we will kill
EDL	01:01:09,375	01:01:13,166	| kennedy |	130 million Russians. So we will win. And
EDL	01:01:13,166	01:01:15,166	| kennedy |	that was a victory for them.
EDL	01:01:15,166	01:01:16,416	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	01:01:16,416	01:01:18,583	| kennedy |	And my uncle said, later said,
EDL	01:01:18,583	01:01:20,875	| kennedy |	he told Arthur Schlesinger and Kenny
EDL	01:01:20,875	01:01:22,750	| kennedy |	O'Donnell, he said those guys, he called
EDL	01:01:22,750	01:01:24,000	| kennedy |	them the salad brass,
EDL	01:01:24,000	01:01:25,583	| kennedy |	the guys with all of this stuff on their
EDL	01:01:25,583	01:01:28,916	| kennedy |	chest. And he said, he said,
EDL	01:01:28,916	01:01:30,416	| kennedy |	those guys, they don't care
EDL	01:01:30,416	01:01:30,958	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	01:01:30,958	01:01:33,291	| kennedy |	because they know that if it happens,
EDL	01:01:33,291	01:01:33,666	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	01:01:33,666	01:01:34,333	| kennedy |	that they're going to be
EDL	01:01:34,333	01:01:35,375	| kennedy |	in the charge of everything.
EDL	01:01:35,375	01:01:35,833	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	01:01:35,833	01:01:36,958	| kennedy |	They're the ones who are going to be
EDL	01:01:36,958	01:01:37,875	| kennedy |	running the world after
EDL	01:01:37,875	01:01:40,000	| kennedy |	that. So for them, you know,
EDL	01:01:40,000	01:01:42,000	| kennedy |	it was, there was an incentive to kill
EDL	01:01:42,000	01:01:44,291	| kennedy |	130 million Russians and 30 million
EDL	01:01:44,291	01:01:45,541	| kennedy |	Americans. But my uncle,
EDL	01:01:45,541	01:01:46,000	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	01:01:46,000	01:01:47,750	| kennedy |	he had this correspondence with the crew
EDL	01:01:47,750	01:01:49,916	| kennedy |	chef. They were secretly
EDL	01:01:49,916	01:01:51,416	| kennedy |	corresponding with each other.

EDL	01:01:51,916	01:01:54,125	| kennedy |	And that is what saved the world is that
EDL	01:01:54,125	01:01:55,375	| kennedy |	they had that both of
EDL	01:01:55,375	01:01:57,125	| kennedy |	them had been men of war.
EDL	01:01:57,125	01:01:57,750	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]

EDL	01:02:00,083	01:02:02,458	| kennedy |	not be a man of war. It will

EDL	01:03:28,416	01:03:31,208	| kennedy |	he would immediately be killed. So they
EDL	01:03:31,208	01:03:33,333	| kennedy |	had no eyes in the Kremlin. You know,
EDL	01:03:33,333	01:03:34,041	| kennedy |	there were literally
EDL	01:03:34,041	01:03:37,083	| kennedy |	hundreds of Russia of Russian spies who

EDL	01:03:41,875	01:03:44,833	| kennedy |	that period. They had no idea anything
EDL	01:03:44,833	01:03:46,250	| kennedy |	about crew chef about
EDL	01:03:46,250	01:03:48,000	| kennedy |	how he saw the world. And they saw the
EDL	01:03:48,000	01:03:49,000	| kennedy |	Kremlin itself as a
EDL	01:03:49,000	01:03:52,125	| kennedy |	monolith, you know, that this, this

EDL	01:03:59,875	01:04:01,291	| kennedy |	that's it's driving them.
EDL	01:04:01,291	01:04:02,333	| kennedy |	And there's nothing else they
EDL	01:04:02,333	01:04:04,208	| kennedy |	think about. They're absolutely single
EDL	01:04:04,208	01:04:06,375	| kennedy |	minded about it. But
EDL	01:04:06,375	01:04:08,375	| kennedy |	actually, there was a big division

EDL	01:04:09,208	01:04:12,916	| kennedy |	between crew chef and, and his joint

EDL	01:04:14,500	01:04:15,625	| kennedy |	And they, and they both
EDL	01:04:15,625	01:04:17,666	| kennedy |	at one point discovered they were both in
EDL	01:04:17,666	01:04:18,708	| kennedy |	the same situation. They
EDL	01:04:18,708	01:04:21,000	| kennedy |	were surrounded by spies and
EDL	01:04:21,000	01:04:23,125	| kennedy |	military personnel who were intent on

EDL	01:04:25,916	01:04:29,625	| kennedy |	when my uncle, my uncle had this idea of,

EDL	01:05:05,333	01:05:07,083	| kennedy |	meet crew chef in Geneva,

EDL	01:05:07,708	01:05:09,750	| kennedy |	to do a summit. And by the way,
EDL	01:05:09,750	01:05:11,250	| kennedy |	Eisenhower had wanted to do the same
EDL	01:05:11,250	01:05:12,791	| kennedy |	thing. Eisenhower wanted

EDL	01:05:15,625	01:05:18,708	| kennedy |	in Vienna, but that peace summit was
EDL	01:05:18,708	01:05:19,708	| kennedy |	blown up. He was going

EDL	01:05:40,125	01:05:41,083	| kennedy |	And then they told, and then
EDL	01:05:41,083	01:05:43,916	| kennedy |	Alan Dulles told Eisenhower to
EDL	01:05:43,916	01:05:45,416	| kennedy |	deny that we had a program. They didn't
EDL	01:05:45,416	01:05:46,666	| kennedy |	know that the Russians had

EDL	01:05:49,500	01:05:52,375	| kennedy |	And so when, and that blew up the peace

EDL	01:06:37,583	01:06:39,583	| kennedy |	we had a spy that used to come to our

EDL	01:06:41,666	01:06:43,208	| kennedy |	Bolshegoit. He was this
EDL	01:06:43,208	01:06:47,333	| kennedy |	Russian spy. My, my parents had met at

EDL	01:06:50,583	01:06:52,666	| kennedy |	at the Russian embassy and he had
EDL	01:06:52,666	01:06:54,500	| kennedy |	approached them and they knew he was a,
EDL	01:06:54,500	01:06:56,333	| kennedy |	he was a GRU agent and
EDL	01:06:56,333	01:07:00,958	| kennedy |	KGB. He was both. Oh, he used to come to
EDL	01:07:00,958	01:07:01,916	| kennedy |	our house. They really liked

EDL	01:07:04,416	01:07:06,583	| kennedy |	He was always laughing and joking. He
EDL	01:07:06,583	01:07:07,458	| kennedy |	would do rope climbing
EDL	01:07:07,458	01:07:09,166	| kennedy |	contests with my father. He would
EDL	01:07:09,166	01:07:11,458	| kennedy |	do pushup contests with my father. He
EDL	01:07:11,458	01:07:13,041	| kennedy |	was, he could do the Russian

EDL	01:07:18,416	01:07:19,666	| kennedy |	that. And he was, and we
EDL	01:07:19,666	01:07:21,166	| kennedy |	knew he was a spy too. And this
EDL	01:07:21,166	01:07:22,875	| kennedy |	was at the time of, you know, the James

EDL	01:07:45,083	01:07:46,750	| kennedy |	sent this long letter to my

EDL	01:09:51,791	01:09:52,958	| kennedy |	had come to the wall and there was a

EDL	01:09:59,375	01:10:01,625	| kennedy |	then through Dobren and saying, my back
EDL	01:10:01,625	01:10:03,208	| kennedy |	is at the wall. I cannot, I
EDL	01:10:03,208	01:10:05,458	| kennedy |	have no place to back, to please
EDL	01:10:05,458	01:10:07,833	| kennedy |	back off and then we will back off. And
EDL	01:10:07,833	01:10:10,875	| kennedy |	Khrushchev took his word, backed his
EDL	01:10:10,875	01:10:12,083	| kennedy |	tanks off first. And then
EDL	01:10:12,083	01:10:15,291	| kennedy |	my uncle ordered LeMay to back, like he
EDL	01:10:15,291	01:10:17,541	| kennedy |	had, LeMay had mounted

EDL	01:10:33,125	01:10:35,375	| kennedy |	talking to each other. And then when you,
EDL	01:10:35,375	01:10:36,666	| kennedy |	after he wrote that letter,
EDL	01:10:36,666	01:10:37,791	| kennedy |	they agreed that they would

EDL	01:10:48,500	01:10:50,375	| kennedy |	was a red phone that we

EDL	01:10:51,583	01:10:54,583	| kennedy |	Khrushchev would answer. And there was

EDL	01:10:58,500	01:11:00,916	| kennedy |	was important to talk to each other, you
EDL	01:11:00,916	01:11:02,208	| kennedy |	know, and you just wish that
EDL	01:11:02,208	01:11:03,500	| kennedy |	we had that kind of leadership

EDL	01:11:11,666	01:11:14,500	| kennedy |	right? And you know how dangerous it is

EDL	01:11:24,166	01:11:25,125	| kennedy |	it's going to steal our job,
EDL	01:11:25,125	01:11:27,541	| kennedy |	and it's going to kill us, right? And
EDL	01:11:27,541	01:11:28,541	| kennedy |	it's, it's probably not
EDL	01:11:28,541	01:11:30,500	| kennedy |	hyperbole. It's actually, you know,
EDL	01:11:30,500	01:11:32,750	| kennedy |	if it follows the laws of biological

EDL	01:19:23,750	01:19:25,958	| kennedy |	the CIA was involved in the murder of the

EDL	01:19:59,250	01:20:01,041	| kennedy |	And what I suggest to people,
EDL	01:20:01,041	01:20:02,708	| kennedy |	there are hundreds of books written about
EDL	01:20:02,708	01:20:05,583	| kennedy |	this, that, you know, assemble this
EDL	01:20:05,583	01:20:07,041	| kennedy |	evidence and mobilize
EDL	01:20:07,041	01:20:09,125	| kennedy |	the evidence. The best book to me for
EDL	01:20:09,125	01:20:12,125	| kennedy |	people to read is James
EDL	01:20:12,125	01:20:13,833	| kennedy |	Douglas's book, which is called
EDL	01:20:13,833	01:20:17,416	| kennedy |	The Unspeakable. And he, Douglas does
EDL	01:20:17,416	01:20:18,375	| kennedy |	this extraordinary, he's
EDL	01:20:18,375	01:20:19,583	| kennedy |	an extraordinary scholar,
EDL	01:20:19,583	01:20:24,125	| kennedy |	and he does this amazing job of digesting
EDL	01:20:24,125	01:20:25,750	| kennedy |	and summarizing and
EDL	01:20:25,750	01:20:28,625	| kennedy |	mobilizing all of the, you know,
EDL	01:20:28,625	01:20:30,916	| kennedy |	probably a million documents and, you
EDL	01:20:30,916	01:20:32,250	| kennedy |	know, the evidence from all these
EDL	01:20:32,250	01:20:33,500	| kennedy |	confessions that have come
EDL	01:20:33,500	01:20:37,000	| kennedy |	out into a coherent story. And it's
EDL	01:20:37,000	01:20:38,833	| kennedy |	riveting to read. And, you know, I
EDL	01:20:38,833	01:20:40,041	| kennedy |	recommend people who
EDL	01:20:40,041	01:20:41,041	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	01:20:41,041	01:20:44,208	| kennedy |	do not take my word for it, you know, and

EDL	01:20:46,083	01:20:47,833	| kennedy |	anybody else's word for go ahead
EDL	01:20:47,833	01:20:49,666	| kennedy |	and do the research yourself. And one way
EDL	01:20:49,666	01:20:52,166	| kennedy |	to do that is probably the
EDL	01:20:52,166	01:20:53,416	| kennedy |	most efficient way is to read
EDL	01:20:53,416	01:20:55,416	| kennedy |	Douglas's book. He has all the references
EDL	01:20:55,416	01:20:57,041	| kennedy |	there. So if it's true
EDL	01:20:57,041	01:20:59,500	| kennedy |	that CIA had a hand in this
EDL	01:20:59,500	01:21:02,208	| kennedy |	assassination, how is it possible for
EDL	01:21:02,208	01:21:04,500	| kennedy |	them to amass so much power? How is it
EDL	01:21:04,500	01:21:05,208	| kennedy |	possible for them to
EDL	01:21:05,208	01:21:08,625	| kennedy |	become corrupt? And is it individuals or
EDL	01:21:08,625	01:21:09,250	| kennedy |	is it the entire
EDL	01:21:09,250	01:21:11,333	| kennedy |	institution? No, it's not the entire
EDL	01:21:11,333	01:21:14,125	| kennedy |	institution. My daughter-in-law, who's
EDL	01:21:14,125	01:21:16,083	| kennedy |	helping to run my campaign,
EDL	01:21:16,083	01:21:18,333	| kennedy |	was a CIA, you know, in the
EDL	01:21:18,333	01:21:23,000	| kennedy |	clandestine services for all of her
EDL	01:21:23,000	01:21:25,250	| kennedy |	career. She was a spy in the
EDL	01:21:25,250	01:21:26,333	| kennedy |	Weapons of Mass Destruction
EDL	01:21:26,333	01:21:29,458	| kennedy |	Program in the Mideast and in China. And
EDL	01:21:29,458	01:21:31,708	| kennedy |	there's 22,000 people who work for the
EDL	01:21:31,708	01:21:33,625	| kennedy |	CIA, probably 20,000
EDL	01:21:33,625	01:21:35,916	| kennedy |	of those are, you know, are patriotic
EDL	01:21:35,916	01:21:37,625	| kennedy |	Americans and really good
EDL	01:21:37,625	01:21:39,500	| kennedy |	public servants and they're doing
EDL	01:21:39,500	01:21:42,833	| kennedy |	important work for our country. But the
EDL	01:21:42,833	01:21:44,958	| kennedy |	institution is corrupt. And
EDL	01:21:44,958	01:21:46,791	| kennedy |	because the higher ranks the
EDL	01:21:46,791	01:21:50,458	| kennedy |	institution. And in fact, Mike Pompeo
EDL	01:21:50,458	01:21:52,125	| kennedy |	said something like this
EDL	01:21:52,125	01:21:53,083	| kennedy |	to me the other day was
EDL	01:21:53,083	01:21:55,000	| kennedy |	the director of the CIA. And when I was
EDL	01:21:55,000	01:21:57,041	| kennedy |	there, I did not do a good job of
EDL	01:21:57,041	01:21:58,166	| kennedy |	cleaning up that agency.
EDL	01:21:58,166	01:22:00,416	| kennedy |	And he said the entire upper bureaucracy
EDL	01:22:00,416	01:22:03,416	| kennedy |	of that agency are people
EDL	01:22:03,416	01:22:04,958	| kennedy |	who do not believe in the
EDL	01:22:04,958	01:22:09,416	| kennedy |	institutions of democracy. This is what
EDL	01:22:09,416	01:22:11,666	| kennedy |	he said to me. So I don't know if that's

EDL	01:22:12,916	01:22:14,833	| kennedy |	you know, that's significant. He's a

EDL	01:22:17,041	01:22:17,958	| kennedy |	was the secretary of

EDL	01:22:22,000	01:22:24,541	| kennedy |	happened. We know the

EDL	01:23:22,375	01:23:24,291	| kennedy |	is important. It's to get

EDL	01:24:28,125	01:24:30,791	| kennedy |	we were in the middle of the Cold War and
EDL	01:24:30,791	01:24:32,875	| kennedy |	Truman and Eisenhower did
EDL	01:24:32,875	01:24:34,625	| kennedy |	not want to go to war. They
EDL	01:24:34,625	01:24:37,166	| kennedy |	didn't want to commit troops. And it
EDL	01:24:37,166	01:24:38,708	| kennedy |	seemed to them that, you
EDL	01:24:38,708	01:24:40,000	| kennedy |	know, this was a way of kind of
EDL	01:24:40,000	01:24:40,625	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	01:24:40,625	01:24:44,041	| kennedy |	fighting the Cold War secretly without

EDL	01:24:51,833	01:24:55,083	| kennedy |	sort of invisibly. And so it was
EDL	01:24:55,083	01:24:56,541	| kennedy |	seductive to them. But
EDL	01:24:56,541	01:24:58,208	| kennedy |	everybody, you know, Congress,
EDL	01:24:58,208	01:24:59,791	| kennedy |	when they first voted it in place,

EDL	01:25:00,166	01:25:01,541	| kennedy |	Congress, both political parties said,

EDL	01:25:02,791	01:25:04,416	| kennedy |	if we create this thing, it could turn

EDL	01:25:05,458	01:25:06,833	| kennedy |	could undermine our, you know,
EDL	01:25:06,833	01:25:10,000	| kennedy |	our values. And today it's so powerful
EDL	01:25:10,000	01:25:11,208	| kennedy |	and then nobody knows what
EDL	01:25:11,208	01:25:13,541	| kennedy |	its budget is. Plus it has its
EDL	01:25:13,541	01:25:17,166	| kennedy |	own investment fund in QTEL, which has

EDL	01:25:18,916	01:25:20,458	| kennedy |	think, 2000 investments in
EDL	01:25:20,458	01:25:23,541	| kennedy |	Silicon Valley. Oh, it has ownership of a
EDL	01:25:23,541	01:25:24,666	| kennedy |	lot of these tech
EDL	01:25:24,666	01:25:27,000	| kennedy |	companies that, you know, and the,

EDL	01:25:38,833	01:25:41,750	| kennedy |	their assets removed, et cetera. The

EDL	01:25:54,000	01:25:57,166	| kennedy |	for most of its life, the CIA was banned

EDL	01:25:59,833	01:26:01,625	| kennedy |	But we learned that they were doing it
EDL	01:26:01,625	01:26:04,208	| kennedy |	anyway. So in 1973, during
EDL	01:26:04,208	01:26:05,625	| kennedy |	the church committee hearings,
EDL	01:26:05,625	01:26:09,458	| kennedy |	we learned that the CIA had a program
EDL	01:26:09,458	01:26:10,166	| kennedy |	called Operation
EDL	01:26:10,166	01:26:13,375	| kennedy |	Mockingbird where they had at least
EDL	01:26:13,375	01:26:15,583	| kennedy |	400 members, leading members of the
EDL	01:26:15,583	01:26:16,458	| kennedy |	United States press
EDL	01:26:16,458	01:26:18,875	| kennedy |	corps and the New York times,
EDL	01:26:18,875	01:26:22,250	| kennedy |	the Washington post, ABC, CBS, NBC, et
EDL	01:26:22,250	01:26:24,750	| kennedy |	cetera, who were secretly
EDL	01:26:24,750	01:26:26,333	| kennedy |	working for the agency and,
EDL	01:26:26,333	01:26:32,041	| kennedy |	and steering news coverage to support CIA
EDL	01:26:32,041	01:26:35,125	| kennedy |	priorities. And they
EDL	01:26:35,125	01:26:36,500	| kennedy |	agreed at that time to
EDL	01:26:36,500	01:26:41,166	| kennedy |	disband Operation Mockingbird in 73. But
EDL	01:26:41,166	01:26:42,708	| kennedy |	there's, there's indications
EDL	01:26:42,708	01:26:44,000	| kennedy |	they didn't do that. And they
EDL	01:26:44,000	01:26:45,833	| kennedy |	still, the CIA today is the biggest
EDL	01:26:45,833	01:26:47,125	| kennedy |	funder of journalism around
EDL	01:26:47,125	01:26:50,416	| kennedy |	the world. Oh, the biggest
EDL	01:26:50,416	01:26:55,166	| kennedy |	funder is through USAID. I'm the USA, the
EDL	01:26:55,166	01:26:56,333	| kennedy |	United States funds
EDL	01:26:56,333	01:26:58,083	| kennedy |	journalism in almost every country
EDL	01:26:58,083	01:26:59,708	| kennedy |	in the world. You know, it owns
EDL	01:26:59,708	01:27:02,833	| kennedy |	newspapers, it has journalists on it,
EDL	01:27:02,833	01:27:03,916	| kennedy |	thousands and thousands of
EDL	01:27:03,916	01:27:06,541	| kennedy |	journalists on its payroll. They're not
EDL	01:27:06,541	01:27:07,541	| kennedy |	supposed to be doing that in
EDL	01:27:07,541	01:27:09,916	| kennedy |	the United States, but, you
EDL	01:27:09,916	01:27:13,833	| kennedy |	know, in 2016, President Obama changed
EDL	01:27:13,833	01:27:15,541	| kennedy |	the law to make it legal now
EDL	01:27:15,541	01:27:18,166	| kennedy |	for the CIA to propagandize
EDL	01:27:18,166	01:27:20,000	| kennedy |	Americans. And I think, you know, we
EDL	01:27:20,000	01:27:21,666	| kennedy |	can't look at the Ukraine
EDL	01:27:21,666	01:27:24,500	| kennedy |	war and how that was, you know,
EDL	01:27:24,500	01:27:26,541	| kennedy |	has been, how the narrative has been
EDL	01:27:26,541	01:27:29,166	| kennedy |	formed in the, in the minds
EDL	01:27:29,166	01:27:32,125	| kennedy |	of Americans and say that the
EDL	01:27:32,125	01:27:34,875	| kennedy |	CIA had nothing to do with that. What is
EDL	01:27:34,875	01:27:35,958	| kennedy |	the mechanism I wish to
EDL	01:27:35,958	01:27:37,791	| kennedy |	say influences the narrative?
EDL	01:27:37,791	01:27:39,291	| kennedy |	Do you think it's indirectly through the
EDL	01:27:39,291	01:27:40,958	| kennedy |	press, indirectly through
EDL	01:27:40,958	01:27:42,000	| kennedy |	the press or directly by

EDL	01:27:45,666	01:27:46,458	| kennedy |	memo. I mean, there's
EDL	01:27:46,458	01:27:48,500	| kennedy |	certain press organs that have
EDL	01:27:48,500	01:27:50,958	| kennedy |	been linked, you know, to the agency that
EDL	01:27:50,958	01:27:52,041	| kennedy |	the people who run those
EDL	01:27:52,041	01:27:53,708	| kennedy |	organs, things like the

EDL	01:28:07,708	01:28:09,125	| kennedy |	why they would do it. So from my
EDL	01:28:09,125	01:28:11,250	| kennedy |	perspective, it just seems like the job
EDL	01:28:11,250	01:28:12,208	| kennedy |	of a journalist is to
EDL	01:28:12,208	01:28:14,166	| kennedy |	have an integrity where your opinion
EDL	01:28:14,166	01:28:16,541	| kennedy |	cannot be influenced or
EDL	01:28:16,541	01:28:18,875	| kennedy |	bought. I agree with you. But I
EDL	01:28:18,875	01:28:20,875	| kennedy |	actually think that the entire field of
EDL	01:28:20,875	01:28:26,333	| kennedy |	journalism has, has, you know, really
EDL	01:28:26,333	01:28:28,791	| kennedy |	shamed itself in recent
EDL	01:28:28,791	01:28:31,750	| kennedy |	years, because it's become, you know, the

EDL	01:41:39,375	01:41:42,291	| kennedy |	to Ireland. This is an incredible
EDL	01:41:42,291	01:41:45,875	| kennedy |	emotional homecoming for all

EDL	01:41:50,458	01:41:51,375	| kennedy |	Colombia, he went to
EDL	01:41:51,375	01:41:53,250	| kennedy |	Latin America, but Colombia was his

EDL	01:41:55,958	01:41:56,875	| kennedy |	think there were two million

EDL	01:42:11,041	01:42:13,250	| kennedy |	said, why? And he said, because they
EDL	01:42:13,250	01:42:15,250	| kennedy |	think you've put America on the side of

EDL	01:42:47,583	01:42:48,416	| kennedy |	And that's what we ought

EDL	01:54:49,625	01:54:52,541	| kennedy |	wasn't addictive. They pressured

EDL	01:56:27,583	01:56:33,291	| kennedy |	You need a regulatory structure that is,

EDL	01:56:43,250	01:56:44,875	| kennedy |	we've set this up the way
EDL	01:56:44,875	01:56:47,291	| kennedy |	that the system is set up today,
EDL	01:56:47,291	01:56:51,458	| kennedy |	has created this system of regulatory

EDL	01:56:57,375	01:57:00,250	| kennedy |	from pharmaceutical companies. The people
EDL	01:57:00,250	01:57:02,291	| kennedy |	who work at FDA are, you
EDL	01:57:02,291	01:57:03,875	| kennedy |	know, their money is coming,
EDL	01:57:03,875	01:57:05,625	| kennedy |	their salaries are coming from pharma,

EDL	01:57:06,041	01:57:08,541	| kennedy |	half their salaries. So they're, you

EDL	01:57:25,791	01:57:27,041	| kennedy |	think money can buy integrity?

EDL	01:57:27,750	01:57:29,458	| kennedy |	Oh yeah, of course it can. And the right,
EDL	01:57:29,458	01:57:30,375	| kennedy |	right. Yeah. I mean,
EDL	01:57:30,375	01:57:32,250	| kennedy |	there's, that's not something that
EDL	01:57:32,250	01:57:35,625	| kennedy |	is, that is controversial. Of course it
EDL	01:57:35,625	01:57:37,500	| kennedy |	will. So, and then
EDL	01:57:37,500	01:57:39,625	| kennedy |	controversial to me, I would like to think
EDL	01:57:39,625	01:57:41,458	| kennedy |	that science that we may not be able to
EDL	01:57:41,458	01:57:43,000	| kennedy |	buy urine. Take around talking about
EDL	01:57:43,000	01:57:44,000	| kennedy |	population wide. I'm
EDL	01:57:44,000	01:57:46,166	| kennedy |	not talking about the individual, but I'd
EDL	01:57:46,166	01:57:46,916	| kennedy |	like to believe that
EDL	01:57:46,916	01:57:51,750	| kennedy |	scientists, I mean, in general,
EDL	01:57:51,750	01:57:53,708	| kennedy |	career of a scientist is not a very high
EDL	01:57:53,708	01:57:55,375	| kennedy |	paying job. I'd like to
EDL	01:57:55,375	01:57:56,791	| kennedy |	believe that people that go into
EDL	01:57:56,791	01:57:57,125	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	01:57:57,125	01:57:59,208	| kennedy |	science that work at FDA, that work at
EDL	01:57:59,208	01:58:01,375	| kennedy |	NIH are doing it for a
EDL	01:58:01,375	01:58:04,000	| kennedy |	reason that's not even correlated
EDL	01:58:04,000	01:58:07,041	| kennedy |	with money. Really. Yeah. And I think
EDL	01:58:07,041	01:58:08,208	| kennedy |	probably that's why they go
EDL	01:58:08,208	01:58:09,375	| kennedy |	in there, but scientists are
EDL	01:58:09,375	01:58:11,791	| kennedy |	corruptible. And you know, I had the way,
EDL	01:58:11,791	01:58:14,875	| kennedy |	the way that I can tell you
EDL	01:58:14,875	01:58:16,208	| kennedy |	that is that I've brought over
EDL	01:58:16,208	01:58:18,500	| kennedy |	500 lawsuits and almost all of them
EDL	01:58:18,500	01:58:20,625	| kennedy |	involve scientific controversies. And
EDL	01:58:20,625	01:58:21,500	| kennedy |	there are scientists
EDL	01:58:21,500	01:58:25,166	| kennedy |	on both sides in everyone. When I, when
EDL	01:58:25,166	01:58:27,583	| kennedy |	we sued Monsanto, there was on the

EDL	01:58:28,500	01:58:30,333	| kennedy |	was a Yale scientist, a Stanford
EDL	01:58:30,333	01:58:32,500	| kennedy |	scientist and a Harvard scientist. And on
EDL	01:58:32,500	01:58:33,416	| kennedy |	our side, there was a
EDL	01:58:33,416	01:58:35,166	| kennedy |	Yale Stanford and Harvard scientist, and
EDL	01:58:35,166	01:58:36,083	| kennedy |	they were telling us saying
EDL	01:58:36,083	01:58:37,833	| kennedy |	exactly the opposite things.

EDL	01:58:38,791	01:58:40,958	| kennedy |	In fact, there's a word for those kinds
EDL	01:58:40,958	01:58:42,250	| kennedy |	of scientists who take money

EDL	01:58:42,625	01:58:44,541	| kennedy |	for their opinion. And the word is by

EDL	01:58:48,041	01:58:49,916	| kennedy |	common. And, you know,
EDL	01:58:49,916	01:58:51,750	| kennedy |	and I've been dealing with them my whole
EDL	01:58:51,750	01:58:53,250	| kennedy |	career. You know, I think it
EDL	01:58:53,250	01:58:54,583	| kennedy |	was Upton Sinclair who said
EDL	01:58:54,583	01:58:55,458	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	01:58:55,458	01:58:59,625	| kennedy |	that it's very difficult to persuade a
EDL	01:58:59,625	01:59:01,000	| kennedy |	man of a fact if the
EDL	01:59:01,000	01:59:02,875	| kennedy |	existence of that fact will diminish
EDL	01:59:02,875	01:59:05,458	| kennedy |	his salary. And I think that's true for
EDL	01:59:05,458	01:59:07,208	| kennedy |	all of us. If they, you
EDL	01:59:07,208	01:59:08,333	| kennedy |	know, we find a way of
EDL	01:59:08,333	01:59:11,208	| kennedy |	reconciling ourselves, the things that
EDL	01:59:11,208	01:59:14,458	| kennedy |	are to the truth that
EDL	01:59:14,458	01:59:17,000	| kennedy |	actually end worldviews
EDL	01:59:17,000	01:59:20,583	| kennedy |	and actually benefit our salaries. Now,
EDL	01:59:20,583	01:59:24,250	| kennedy |	NIH, NIH has probably the
EDL	01:59:24,250	01:59:26,250	| kennedy |	worst system, which is that
EDL	01:59:26,250	01:59:29,625	| kennedy |	scientists work for NIH. NIH itself,
EDL	01:59:29,625	01:59:31,000	| kennedy |	which used to be the

EDL	01:59:35,541	01:59:38,000	| kennedy |	NIH that today it's just an

EDL	01:59:39,291	01:59:42,750	| kennedy |	drugs. And, you know, that is that
EDL	01:59:42,750	01:59:45,458	| kennedy |	gravity of economic self-interest.

EDL	01:59:46,333	01:59:49,750	| kennedy |	Because if NIH itself
EDL	01:59:49,750	01:59:52,625	| kennedy |	collects royalties, they have margin
EDL	01:59:52,625	01:59:53,916	| kennedy |	rights for the patents on all

EDL	01:59:55,875	01:59:57,916	| kennedy |	So with the Moderna vaccine, which they

EDL	02:02:18,958	02:02:20,625	| kennedy |	scientists around the world to induce

EDL	02:02:25,500	02:02:27,833	| kennedy |	vaccine, 98 million people who got that
EDL	02:02:27,833	02:02:29,125	| kennedy |	vaccine and my generation
EDL	02:02:29,125	02:02:30,708	| kennedy |	got it. And now you've had this

EDL	02:02:41,208	02:02:42,875	| kennedy |	was effective against polio?
EDL	02:02:42,875	02:02:46,041	| kennedy |	I'm going to say yes. If you said to me,
EDL	02:02:46,041	02:02:47,291	| kennedy |	did it kill more people?

EDL	02:03:13,458	02:03:16,500	| kennedy |	That vaccine caused so many injuries that
EDL	02:03:16,500	02:03:17,833	| kennedy |	Wlajez, which was the
EDL	02:03:17,833	02:03:20,208	| kennedy |	manufacturer, was said to the Reagan
EDL	02:03:20,208	02:03:23,583	| kennedy |	administration, we are now paying $20 in
EDL	02:03:23,583	02:03:24,875	| kennedy |	downstream liabilities for
EDL	02:03:24,875	02:03:26,041	| kennedy |	every dollar that we're making

EDL	02:03:26,416	02:03:28,500	| kennedy |	in profits. And we are getting out of the
EDL	02:03:28,500	02:03:29,333	| kennedy |	business unless you
EDL	02:03:29,333	02:03:31,291	| kennedy |	give us permanent immunity
EDL	02:03:31,291	02:03:34,500	| kennedy |	from liability. So the vaccine companies
EDL	02:03:34,500	02:03:36,791	| kennedy |	then were given. And by
EDL	02:03:36,791	02:03:38,250	| kennedy |	the way, Reagan said at that
EDL	02:03:38,250	02:03:39,875	| kennedy |	time, why don't you just make the vaccine
EDL	02:03:39,875	02:03:43,041	| kennedy |	safe? And why is that?
EDL	02:03:43,041	02:03:44,875	| kennedy |	Because vaccines are inherently
EDL	02:03:44,875	02:03:47,625	| kennedy |	unsafe. They said, unavoidably unsafe.
EDL	02:03:47,625	02:03:50,750	| kennedy |	You cannot make them safe. And so when
EDL	02:03:50,750	02:03:52,166	| kennedy |	Reagan wrote the bill
EDL	02:03:52,166	02:03:54,625	| kennedy |	and passed it, the bill says in its
EDL	02:03:54,625	02:03:55,583	| kennedy |	preamble, because
EDL	02:03:55,583	02:03:57,750	| kennedy |	vaccines are unavoidably unsafe.

EDL	02:03:58,500	02:04:00,250	| kennedy |	And the Bruceowitz case, which was a

EDL	02:04:02,625	02:04:03,666	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	02:04:03,666	02:04:05,458	| kennedy |	uses that same language. Vaccines cannot
EDL	02:04:05,458	02:04:06,500	| kennedy |	be made safe. They're
EDL	02:04:06,500	02:04:08,250	| kennedy |	unavoidably unsafe. So this is what
EDL	02:04:08,250	02:04:10,208	| kennedy |	the law says now. I just want to finish
EDL	02:04:10,208	02:04:11,750	| kennedy |	this story because this

EDL	02:06:52,125	02:06:53,333	| kennedy |	you have to do a placebo

EDL	02:06:55,375	02:06:58,458	| kennedy |	where you look at health outcomes among

EDL	02:07:03,083	02:07:06,000	| kennedy |	and compare those to a similarly situated

EDL	02:07:15,500	02:07:16,541	| kennedy |	trials prior to the license
EDL	02:07:16,541	02:07:19,916	| kennedy |	or vaccines, one of the 72 vaccines that

EDL	02:07:26,041	02:07:27,875	| kennedy |	licensure. So I should say that there's a
EDL	02:07:27,875	02:07:29,000	| kennedy |	bunch on that point,
EDL	02:07:29,000	02:07:29,666	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	02:07:29,666	02:07:31,083	| kennedy |	I've heard from a bunch of folks that
EDL	02:07:31,083	02:07:32,583	| kennedy |	disagree with you, including
EDL	02:07:32,583	02:07:34,500	| kennedy |	polio. I mean, in the test,
EDL	02:07:34,500	02:07:34,875	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	02:07:34,875	02:07:36,000	| kennedy |	testing is a really important point
EDL	02:07:36,000	02:07:38,250	| kennedy |	before licensure, placebo
EDL	02:07:38,250	02:07:39,833	| kennedy |	controlled randomized trials,
EDL	02:07:39,833	02:07:41,416	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	02:07:41,416	02:07:46,416	| kennedy |	polio received just that against the

EDL	02:07:47,583	02:07:47,916	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	02:07:47,916	02:07:51,833	| kennedy |	So it seems unclear to me, I'm confused
EDL	02:07:51,833	02:07:53,125	| kennedy |	why you say that that would
EDL	02:07:53,125	02:07:54,125	| kennedy |	then don't go through that
EDL	02:07:54,125	02:07:55,958	| kennedy |	process. It seems like a lot, a lot of
EDL	02:07:55,958	02:07:58,750	| kennedy |	them do. Here's the thing
EDL	02:07:58,750	02:08:02,791	| kennedy |	is that I was saying that for
EDL	02:08:02,791	02:08:04,375	| kennedy |	many years, because we couldn't find any.
EDL	02:08:04,375	02:08:05,000	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	02:08:05,000	02:08:07,250	| kennedy |	And then in 2016, in
EDL	02:08:07,250	02:08:09,708	| kennedy |	March, I met President Trump
EDL	02:08:09,708	02:08:14,125	| kennedy |	ordered Dr. Fauci to meet with me, Dr.
EDL	02:08:14,125	02:08:16,791	| kennedy |	Fauci, and Francis Collins, and I said,
EDL	02:08:16,791	02:08:17,458	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	02:08:17,458	02:08:20,583	| kennedy |	to them during that meeting, you have
EDL	02:08:20,583	02:08:22,083	| kennedy |	been saying that I'm not telling the
EDL	02:08:22,083	02:08:23,166	| kennedy |	truth when I said not
EDL	02:08:23,166	02:08:26,125	| kennedy |	one of these has undergone a prior
EDL	02:08:26,125	02:08:29,750	| kennedy |	pre-licensure placebo control. And the
EDL	02:08:29,750	02:08:30,833	| kennedy |	polio may have had one
EDL	02:08:30,833	02:08:34,041	| kennedy |	post-licency, most of them haven't. The
EDL	02:08:34,041	02:08:35,833	| kennedy |	polio may have, I don't know.
EDL	02:08:35,833	02:08:36,666	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	02:08:36,666	02:08:38,833	| kennedy |	But I said, the our question
EDL	02:08:38,833	02:08:40,958	| kennedy |	was prior to licensure, do you ever test
EDL	02:08:40,958	02:08:44,791	| kennedy |	these? And for safety. And
EDL	02:08:44,791	02:08:47,833	| kennedy |	by the way, I think the polio
EDL	02:08:47,833	02:08:52,000	| kennedy |	vaccine did undergo a saline placebo
EDL	02:08:52,000	02:08:56,000	| kennedy |	trial prior licensure, but not for
EDL	02:08:56,000	02:08:58,625	| kennedy |	safety, only for efficacy.
EDL	02:08:58,625	02:08:59,458	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	02:08:59,458	02:09:02,791	| kennedy |	So I'm talking about safety trials. Now,
EDL	02:09:02,791	02:09:06,250	| kennedy |	Fauci told me that he
EDL	02:09:06,250	02:09:07,958	| kennedy |	would, he said, I can't find one
EDL	02:09:07,958	02:09:10,500	| kennedy |	now. He had a whole tray of files there.
EDL	02:09:10,500	02:09:11,250	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	02:09:11,250	02:09:12,291	| kennedy |	He said, I can't find now
EDL	02:09:12,291	02:09:13,708	| kennedy |	and now, but I'll send you one.
EDL	02:09:13,708	02:09:15,541	| kennedy |	I said, just for any vaccines, and we
EDL	02:09:15,541	02:09:19,291	| kennedy |	want any of the 72 vaccines. He never
EDL	02:09:19,291	02:09:21,708	| kennedy |	did. So we sued the HHS.
EDL	02:09:21,708	02:09:22,666	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	02:09:22,666	02:09:25,041	| kennedy |	And after a year of stonewalling us, HHS
EDL	02:09:25,041	02:09:27,708	| kennedy |	came back. And they gave us
EDL	02:09:27,708	02:09:29,375	| kennedy |	a letter saying we have no
EDL	02:09:29,375	02:09:29,916	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	02:09:29,916	02:09:32,000	| kennedy |	pre-licensing safety trial for any of the
EDL	02:09:32,000	02:09:35,666	| kennedy |	72 vaccines. And that letter from HHS,
EDL	02:09:35,666	02:09:36,166	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	02:09:36,166	02:09:39,500	| kennedy |	which settled our lawsuit against them,
EDL	02:09:39,500	02:09:40,333	| kennedy |	because we had a FOIA
EDL	02:09:40,333	02:09:41,583	| kennedy |	lawsuit against them,
EDL	02:09:41,583	02:09:42,250	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	02:09:42,250	02:09:45,000	| kennedy |	is posted on CHD's website. So anybody
EDL	02:09:45,000	02:09:46,416	| kennedy |	can go look at it. So
EDL	02:09:46,416	02:09:51,416	| kennedy |	if HHS had any study,
EDL	02:09:51,416	02:09:53,000	| kennedy |	I assume they would have given it to us
EDL	02:09:53,000	02:09:54,625	| kennedy |	and they can't find one.
EDL	02:09:54,625	02:09:55,875	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	02:09:55,875	02:09:58,041	| kennedy |	Well, let me zoom out because a lot of
EDL	02:09:58,041	02:09:59,083	| kennedy |	the details matter here. Pre-licensure,

EDL	02:10:00,083	02:10:02,041	| kennedy |	what is placebo controlled mean? So this
EDL	02:10:02,041	02:10:06,583	| kennedy |	probably requires a
EDL	02:10:06,583	02:10:08,875	| kennedy |	rigorous analysis. And actually,
EDL	02:10:08,875	02:10:10,333	| kennedy |	at this point, it would be nice for me
EDL	02:10:10,333	02:10:12,208	| kennedy |	just to give a shout out to

EDL	02:11:49,541	02:11:51,958	| kennedy |	based upon what you say is

EDL	02:12:57,500	02:12:59,541	| kennedy |	I would cite science, and he could never
EDL	02:12:59,541	02:13:01,250	| kennedy |	come back with science. He
EDL	02:13:01,250	02:13:02,250	| kennedy |	could never come back with
EDL	02:13:02,250	02:13:05,375	| kennedy |	publications. He would give publications
EDL	02:13:05,375	02:13:06,833	| kennedy |	that had nothing to do
EDL	02:13:06,833	02:13:08,875	| kennedy |	with, for example, thimerosal
EDL	02:13:08,875	02:13:10,958	| kennedy |	vaccines, mercury-based vaccines. He sent
EDL	02:13:10,958	02:13:14,000	| kennedy |	me one time 16 studies to
EDL	02:13:14,000	02:13:16,500	| kennedy |	rebut something I'd said about
EDL	02:13:16,500	02:13:18,500	| kennedy |	thimerosal, and not one of those studies.
EDL	02:13:18,500	02:13:20,208	| kennedy |	They were all about the MMR vaccine,

EDL	02:13:21,125	02:13:23,708	| kennedy |	thimerosal. So it wasn't like a real

EDL	02:21:05,875	02:21:07,750	| kennedy |	went to the nuns, and I went
EDL	02:21:07,750	02:21:11,083	| kennedy |	to a Quaker school at one point. When I

EDL	02:21:54,166	02:21:58,500	| kennedy |	I knew that I had a couple of
EDL	02:21:58,500	02:22:00,000	| kennedy |	experiences. One is that I
EDL	02:22:00,000	02:22:01,750	| kennedy |	had a friend of my brother's,
EDL	02:22:01,750	02:22:03,500	| kennedy |	one of my brothers who died of this
EDL	02:22:03,500	02:22:07,083	| kennedy |	disease of addiction, had a good friend
EDL	02:22:07,083	02:22:09,333	| kennedy |	who had used to take
EDL	02:22:09,333	02:22:13,916	| kennedy |	drugs with us. And he became a Moony. So
EDL	02:22:13,916	02:22:16,458	| kennedy |	he became a follower of
EDL	02:22:16,458	02:22:17,833	| kennedy |	Reverend Sun, Sun Young Moon.
EDL	02:22:17,833	02:22:22,458	| kennedy |	And he's at that point his compulsion, he
EDL	02:22:22,458	02:22:23,208	| kennedy |	had the same kind of
EDL	02:22:23,208	02:22:25,500	| kennedy |	compulsion that I had. And yet it was
EDL	02:22:25,500	02:22:29,666	| kennedy |	completely removed from him. And so, and
EDL	02:22:29,666	02:22:31,000	| kennedy |	he used to come and hang
EDL	02:22:31,000	02:22:33,500	| kennedy |	out with us. But he would not
EDL	02:22:33,500	02:22:35,458	| kennedy |	want to take drugs, even if I was taking
EDL	02:22:35,458	02:22:36,750	| kennedy |	right in front of him, he
EDL	02:22:36,750	02:22:39,000	| kennedy |	was, he was immune to it, he'd
EDL	02:22:39,000	02:22:44,375	| kennedy |	become impervious to that impulse. And I,

EDL	02:23:02,541	02:23:05,125	| kennedy |	I had iron willpower as a kid. I gave up

EDL	02:23:07,750	02:23:11,666	| kennedy |	until I was in college. I gave up, I gave
EDL	02:23:11,666	02:23:12,583	| kennedy |	up desserts the next year for Lent. And I didn't
EDL	02:23:12,583	02:23:16,041	| kennedy |	ever eat another dessert till I was in
EDL	02:23:16,041	02:23:17,291	| kennedy |	college. And I was trying

EDL	02:23:35,666	02:23:38,208	| kennedy |	incomprehensible. I could not understand

EDL	02:23:38,958	02:23:46,666	| kennedy |	like I did with everything else. And so I
EDL	02:23:46,666	02:23:47,500	| kennedy |	was living against

EDL	02:25:26,833	02:25:30,208	| kennedy |	up a book by Carl Jung called
EDL	02:25:30,208	02:25:32,500	| kennedy |	Synchronicity. And Jung,

EDL	02:25:34,541	02:25:35,875	| kennedy |	contemporary of Freud's. He

EDL	02:25:38,583	02:25:40,541	| kennedy |	and Freud wanted him to be his
EDL	02:25:40,541	02:25:42,250	| kennedy |	replacement. But Freud was an avowed
EDL	02:25:42,250	02:25:45,000	| kennedy |	atheist. And Jung was a deeply
EDL	02:25:45,000	02:25:46,916	| kennedy |	spiritual man. He had these very intense

EDL	02:25:48,000	02:25:49,541	| kennedy |	experiences when he was a little

EDL	02:25:52,416	02:25:53,708	| kennedy |	is fascinating about him
EDL	02:25:53,708	02:25:55,041	| kennedy |	because he remembers him with such a
EDL	02:25:55,041	02:26:01,208	| kennedy |	detail. And he, he was, he

EDL	02:26:06,166	02:26:07,125	| kennedy |	And I considered myself

EDL	02:26:08,916	02:26:11,875	| kennedy |	little. And yet he had this

EDL	02:26:52,500	02:26:55,291	| kennedy |	was an insect that is not,

EDL	02:27:10,625	02:27:13,041	| kennedy |	and he, while he was talking to her, he

EDL	02:27:16,250	02:27:17,875	| kennedy |	And he didn't want to turn around to take

EDL	02:27:18,750	02:27:19,875	| kennedy |	but finally he does it.

EDL	02:27:20,708	02:27:22,750	| kennedy |	He, in exasperation, he turns around, he

EDL	02:27:23,708	02:27:25,166	| kennedy |	his scarab beetle flies in and
EDL	02:27:25,166	02:27:27,333	| kennedy |	lands in his hand and he shows it to the
EDL	02:27:27,333	02:27:28,500	| kennedy |	woman and he says, is this
EDL	02:27:28,500	02:27:29,583	| kennedy |	what you were thinking of?
EDL	02:27:29,583	02:27:32,083	| kennedy |	Is this what you were dreaming about? And
EDL	02:27:32,083	02:27:34,416	| kennedy |	he, he was struck by that experience,
EDL	02:27:34,416	02:27:36,000	| kennedy |	experience, which was similar to other
EDL	02:27:36,000	02:27:37,500	| kennedy |	experiences he's had like that. And
EDL	02:27:37,500	02:27:38,541	| kennedy |	that's what synchronicity
EDL	02:27:38,541	02:27:42,166	| kennedy |	means. It's a, it's an instant, a
EDL	02:27:42,166	02:27:45,250	| kennedy |	coincidence, you know? And like, if, so
EDL	02:27:45,250	02:27:47,333	| kennedy |	if you're, if you're

EDL	02:27:48,041	02:27:50,041	| kennedy |	talking with somebody about somebody that

EDL	02:27:50,875	02:27:52,166	| kennedy |	in 20 years and that person
EDL	02:27:52,166	02:27:54,500	| kennedy |	calls on the phone, that's synchronicity.
EDL	02:27:54,500	02:27:57,125	| kennedy |	Oh, and he believed it was a
EDL	02:27:57,125	02:27:58,708	| kennedy |	way that God intervened in our
EDL	02:27:58,708	02:28:01,083	| kennedy |	lives that broke all the, all the rules
EDL	02:28:01,083	02:28:04,416	| kennedy |	of nature that he had set up, the rules

EDL	02:28:08,291	02:28:09,416	| kennedy |	and sort of tap us on their

EDL	02:28:11,833	02:28:15,000	| kennedy |	And, and so he tried to reproduce that in
EDL	02:28:15,000	02:28:17,375	| kennedy |	a clinical setting and
EDL	02:28:17,375	02:28:18,625	| kennedy |	he would put one guy in
EDL	02:28:18,625	02:28:20,041	| kennedy |	one room and another guy in another room
EDL	02:28:20,041	02:28:21,166	| kennedy |	and have them flip guards
EDL	02:28:21,166	02:28:22,333	| kennedy |	and then guess what the other
EDL	02:28:22,333	02:28:24,833	| kennedy |	guy had flipped. And he believed that if
EDL	02:28:24,833	02:28:26,083	| kennedy |	he could beat the laws of
EDL	02:28:26,083	02:28:27,666	| kennedy |	chance, laws of mathematics,

EDL	02:28:28,416	02:28:30,541	| kennedy |	that he would approve the existence of an

EDL	02:28:32,000	02:28:33,041	| kennedy |	supernatural law. And that
EDL	02:28:33,041	02:28:34,416	| kennedy |	was the first step to proving the
EDL	02:28:34,416	02:28:37,500	| kennedy |	existence of a God. He never succeeds in
EDL	02:28:37,500	02:28:38,791	| kennedy |	doing it. But he says
EDL	02:28:38,791	02:28:41,458	| kennedy |	in the book, even though I can't prove
EDL	02:28:41,458	02:28:42,958	| kennedy |	using empirical and scientific
EDL	02:28:42,958	02:28:44,500	| kennedy |	tools, the existence of a God,

EDL	02:28:45,750	02:28:47,791	| kennedy |	I can show through anecdotal evidence
EDL	02:28:47,791	02:28:50,083	| kennedy |	having seen thousands of
EDL	02:28:50,083	02:28:51,208	| kennedy |	patients come through this
EDL	02:28:51,208	02:28:53,041	| kennedy |	institution that people who believe in
EDL	02:28:53,041	02:28:54,708	| kennedy |	God get better faster and
EDL	02:28:54,708	02:28:55,958	| kennedy |	that the recovery is more
EDL	02:28:55,958	02:28:59,208	| kennedy |	enduring than people who don't. And for
EDL	02:28:59,208	02:29:00,750	| kennedy |	me, hearing that was
EDL	02:29:00,750	02:29:02,083	| kennedy |	more impactful than if he

EDL	02:29:02,708	02:29:04,583	| kennedy |	had claimed that he had approved the
EDL	02:29:04,583	02:29:05,875	| kennedy |	existence of a God because I
EDL	02:29:05,875	02:29:06,791	| kennedy |	wouldn't have believed that.

EDL	02:29:07,875	02:29:10,583	| kennedy |	But I, I was already at a mindset where I
EDL	02:29:10,583	02:29:12,250	| kennedy |	would have done anything I could
EDL	02:29:12,250	02:29:12,791	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.5 secs ]
EDL	02:29:12,791	02:29:15,000	| kennedy |	to improve my chances of never having to

EDL	02:29:16,166	02:29:18,791	| kennedy |	1%. And if believing in God
EDL	02:29:18,791	02:29:22,000	| kennedy |	was going to help me, whether there's a
EDL	02:29:22,000	02:29:22,833	| kennedy |	God up there or not,

EDL	02:29:28,916	02:29:30,458	| kennedy |	is, how do you start believing
EDL	02:29:30,458	02:29:32,500	| kennedy |	in something that you can't see or smell
EDL	02:29:32,500	02:29:34,000	| kennedy |	or hear or touch or taste
EDL	02:29:34,000	02:29:36,125	| kennedy |	or acquire with your senses?
EDL	02:29:36,125	02:29:37,416	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	02:29:37,416	02:29:39,583	| kennedy |	And Jung provides the formula for that.
EDL	02:29:39,583	02:29:41,375	| kennedy |	And he says, act as if
EDL	02:29:41,375	02:29:42,500	| kennedy |	you fake it to your make it.
EDL	02:29:42,500	02:29:43,541	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	02:29:43,541	02:29:45,333	| kennedy |	And so that's, you know, what I started
EDL	02:29:45,333	02:29:46,208	| kennedy |	doing. I just started
EDL	02:29:46,208	02:29:47,166	| kennedy |	pretending there was a God watching

EDL	02:29:47,833	02:29:50,958	| kennedy |	me all the time. And kind of life was a
EDL	02:29:50,958	02:29:52,500	| kennedy |	series of tests and each,
EDL	02:29:52,500	02:29:53,500	| kennedy |	there was a bunch of moral
EDL	02:29:53,500	02:29:55,833	| kennedy |	decisions that I had to make every day.
EDL	02:29:55,833	02:29:57,750	| kennedy |	And each one, you know,

EDL	02:30:03,791	02:30:05,250	| kennedy |	I, you know, when the alarm

EDL	02:30:10,083	02:30:13,791	| kennedy |	jump right out of bed? Do I make my bed

EDL	02:30:20,875	02:30:24,250	| kennedy |	into the closet and pull out my blue
EDL	02:30:24,250	02:30:25,250	| kennedy |	jeans and a bunch of
EDL	02:30:25,250	02:30:27,041	| kennedy |	those wire hangers fall on the ground? Do
EDL	02:30:27,041	02:30:29,166	| kennedy |	I shut the door and say I'm
EDL	02:30:29,166	02:30:30,500	| kennedy |	too much, I'm too important
EDL	02:30:30,500	02:30:32,833	| kennedy |	to do that, that somebody else's job or

EDL	02:30:46,000	02:30:46,916	| kennedy |	I make a whole bunch
EDL	02:30:46,916	02:30:48,125	| kennedy |	of those choices right,
EDL	02:30:48,125	02:30:49,708	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	02:30:49,708	02:30:53,000	| kennedy |	that I maintain myself in a posture of

EDL	02:31:00,375	02:31:02,208	| kennedy |	I do those things right,
EDL	02:31:02,208	02:31:03,833	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]
EDL	02:31:03,833	02:31:05,375	| kennedy |	when I you know, so much about
EDL	02:31:05,375	02:31:08,708	| kennedy |	addiction is about abuse of power, abuse
EDL	02:31:08,708	02:31:11,291	| kennedy |	of all of us have some
EDL	02:31:11,291	02:31:12,875	| kennedy |	power, whether it's, you know,
EDL	02:31:12,875	02:31:16,083	| kennedy |	good looks, or whether it's, you know,
EDL	02:31:16,083	02:31:19,750	| kennedy |	connections, or education, or family, or
EDL	02:31:19,750	02:31:21,833	| kennedy |	whatever. And there's
EDL	02:31:21,833	02:31:24,250	| kennedy |	always a temptation, a temptation to use
EDL	02:31:24,250	02:31:27,791	| kennedy |	those to fulfill self will. And the
EDL	02:31:27,791	02:31:29,125	| kennedy |	challenge is how do you
EDL	02:31:29,125	02:31:31,958	| kennedy |	use those always to serve instead God's
EDL	02:31:31,958	02:31:34,125	| kennedy |	will and, you know, the good of our
EDL	02:31:34,125	02:31:35,375	| kennedy |	community. And that,
EDL	02:31:35,375	02:31:36,500	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.1 secs ]
EDL	02:31:36,500	02:31:40,000	| kennedy |	to me, is kind of the struggle. And when
EDL	02:31:40,000	02:31:44,000	| kennedy |	I do that, I feel, I feel
EDL	02:31:44,000	02:31:45,625	| kennedy |	God's power coming through me,
EDL	02:31:45,625	02:31:46,208	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	02:31:46,208	02:31:48,375	| kennedy |	and that I can do things I'm much more
EDL	02:31:48,375	02:31:49,791	| kennedy |	effective as a human being.
EDL	02:31:49,791	02:31:51,083	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.3 secs ]
EDL	02:31:51,083	02:31:52,625	| kennedy |	That that gnawing, you know,
EDL	02:31:52,625	02:31:53,375	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	02:31:53,375	02:31:56,625	| kennedy |	anxiety that I lived with for so many
EDL	02:31:56,625	02:32:00,541	| kennedy |	years, and my God that I it's gone. And
EDL	02:32:00,541	02:32:02,625	| kennedy |	that I can kind of like,
EDL	02:32:02,625	02:32:03,416	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	02:32:03,416	02:32:05,916	| kennedy |	put down the oars and always the sale and
EDL	02:32:05,916	02:32:07,250	| kennedy |	you know, and the wind
EDL	02:32:07,250	02:32:09,833	| kennedy |	takes me and I can I can see
EDL	02:32:09,833	02:32:12,916	| kennedy |	the evidence of it in my life. And you
EDL	02:32:12,916	02:32:15,000	| kennedy |	know, the big thing for you know, the
EDL	02:32:15,000	02:32:16,333	| kennedy |	temptation for me is
EDL	02:32:16,333	02:32:20,541	| kennedy |	that when all these good things start
EDL	02:32:20,541	02:32:22,375	| kennedy |	happening in my life, and the cash and
EDL	02:32:22,375	02:32:23,875	| kennedy |	prizes start flowing in,
EDL	02:32:23,875	02:32:25,083	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	02:32:25,083	02:32:27,416	| kennedy |	you know, how do I maintain that posture
EDL	02:32:27,416	02:32:28,750	| kennedy |	of surrender? How do I
EDL	02:32:28,750	02:32:30,250	| kennedy |	stay surrender then when
EDL	02:32:30,250	02:32:32,500	| kennedy |	my inclination is to say to God, thanks,
EDL	02:32:32,500	02:32:33,666	| kennedy |	God, I got it from here.
EDL	02:32:33,666	02:32:34,250	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.6 secs ]
EDL	02:32:34,250	02:32:35,875	| kennedy |	Yeah, and drive the car off the
EDL	02:32:35,875	02:32:39,458	| kennedy |	cliff again. And so, you know, I had a
EDL	02:32:39,458	02:32:42,208	| kennedy |	spiritual awakening and my desire for
EDL	02:32:42,208	02:32:43,041	| kennedy |	drugs and alcohol was
EDL	02:32:43,041	02:32:47,916	| kennedy |	lifted miraculously. And it to me, it was
EDL	02:32:47,916	02:32:49,666	| kennedy |	as much a miracle as if I
EDL	02:32:49,666	02:32:51,166	| kennedy |	had if I'd been able to walk on
EDL	02:32:51,166	02:32:53,416	| kennedy |	water, because I had tried everything
EDL	02:32:53,416	02:32:54,708	| kennedy |	earnestly, sincerely and
EDL	02:32:54,708	02:32:58,125	| kennedy |	honestly, for a decade to try to
EDL	02:32:58,125	02:33:00,000	| kennedy |	stop and I could not do it under my own
EDL	02:33:00,000	02:33:01,750	| kennedy |	power. And then all of a sudden, it was
EDL	02:33:01,750	02:33:02,583	| kennedy |	lifted effortlessly.
EDL	02:33:02,583	02:33:03,750	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.2 secs ]
EDL	02:33:03,750	02:33:06,541	| kennedy |	And, you know, so I saw that evidence,
EDL	02:33:06,541	02:33:08,083	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.5 secs ]
EDL	02:33:08,083	02:33:09,458	| kennedy |	early evidence of God in my
EDL	02:33:09,458	02:33:11,583	| kennedy |	life, and I'm not the power.
EDL	02:33:11,583	02:33:12,541	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.0 secs ]
EDL	02:33:12,541	02:33:15,166	| kennedy |	And I see it now, you
EDL	02:33:15,166	02:33:16,625	| kennedy |	know, every day of my life.
EDL	02:33:16,625	02:33:17,416	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.8 secs ]
EDL	02:33:17,416	02:33:19,625	| kennedy |	So adding that moral dimension to all of
EDL	02:33:19,625	02:33:21,625	| kennedy |	your actions is how you were able to
EDL	02:33:21,625	02:33:21,958	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.3 secs ]
EDL	02:33:21,958	02:33:23,458	| kennedy |	win that Kamu battle
EDL	02:33:23,458	02:33:26,291	| kennedy |	against the absurd. Exactly.
EDL	02:33:26,291	02:33:26,708	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.4 secs ]
EDL	02:33:26,708	02:33:27,333	| kennedy |	Sisyphus with the boldest.
EDL	02:33:27,333	02:33:29,125	| kennedy |	It's all the same thing. It's the battle
EDL	02:33:29,125	02:33:31,541	| kennedy |	to just to do the right thing.
EDL	02:33:31,541	02:33:32,708	| kennedy |	And now Sisyphus was able
EDL	02:33:32,708	02:33:34,250	| kennedy |	to find somehow happiness.
EDL	02:33:34,250	02:33:34,458	| kennedy |	Yeah.
EDL	02:33:34,458	02:33:36,041	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 1.6 secs ]

EDL	02:33:57,583	02:33:58,583	| kennedy |	from John F. Kennedy.
EDL	02:33:58,583	02:33:59,500	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.9 secs ]
EDL	02:33:59,500	02:34:01,708	| kennedy |	Let us not seek the Republican answer or
EDL	02:34:01,708	02:34:02,791	| kennedy |	the Democratic answer,

EDL	02:34:03,250	02:34:04,291	| kennedy |	but the right answer.

EDL	02:34:04,875	02:34:06,041	| kennedy |	Let us not seek to fix

EDL	02:34:07,041	02:34:07,750	| kennedy |	[ SPACE 0.7 secs ]
EDL	02:34:07,750	02:34:10,250	| kennedy |	Instead, let us accept our own
EDL	02:34:10,250	02:34:12,041	| kennedy |	responsibility for the future.
