EDL	00:07:19,039	00:07:19,551	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So
EDL	00:07:20,063	00:07:21,343	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	To come to the case
EDL	00:07:21,343	00:07:22,367	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It goes to trial
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:24,671	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And had a hung jury
EDL	00:07:24,671	00:07:25,951	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	They end up being a hung jury
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:27,231	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Hip hip hooray
EDL	00:07:27,231	00:07:28,767	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It means they can come to unanimous to
EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:30,303	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	James gets off
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:34,655	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Why was it a hung jury in Kentucky you have to have a unanimous vote
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:37,727	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So the defense is looking for that one juror
EDL	00:07:37,727	00:07:40,799	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The keeps from convicting there is apparently one juror
EDL	00:07:41,311	00:07:44,639	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Who just didn't buy it then by the evidence and thought James was legit
EDL	00:07:45,151	00:07:45,919	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It was a black
EDL	00:07:45,919	00:07:47,967	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	One black lady came to visit me
EDL	00:07:47,967	00:07:49,247	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	After Drew's over
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:52,319	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	She said I really really don't think you're guilty the rest of
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:53,087	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The jury
EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:54,879	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Was trying to make me say that you
EDL	00:07:54,879	00:07:56,671	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Guilty or not guilty
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:59,487	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So end up being a hung jury I was disappointed
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:01,279	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	At that point I was
EDL	00:08:01,279	00:08:03,327	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Having second thoughts about
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,863	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is this the right career for me
EDL	00:08:05,631	00:08:06,399	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	SoJO gottman
EDL	00:08:07,167	00:08:11,519	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He says imma try this case one more time it was pretty close to guilty
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:13,823	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I have this one juror who hung it up
EDL	00:08:13,823	00:08:17,407	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Tell me two or more time and it does something this time
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,455	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	A little differently
EDL	00:08:19,455	00:08:25,855	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Just a setup as you know when you get a jury summons you go in you're on a jury pool
EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:32,255	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	At the beginning of a trial
EDL	00:08:32,255	00:08:38,655	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Jury selection
EDL	00:08:38,655	00:08:45,055	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Eddie asked you touching you're outside the prosecution the defense sometimes the judge they give jurors into a room and they start
EDL	00:08:45,055	00:08:51,455	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Lots of question is there anyone here who has been the victim of a crime
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:57,599	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Victims of crime
EDL	00:08:58,879	00:09:05,279	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	To figure out which stores do we want
EDL	00:09:05,279	00:09:09,375	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Member of a church do we want to get rid of
EDL	00:09:09,375	00:09:15,519	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And that's the more important part of this process which jurors do we want to toss office jury pool
EDL	00:09:17,311	00:09:19,615	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So what are the rules to get rid of jurors
EDL	00:09:19,615	00:09:23,455	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	There's two ways to get rid of jurors to get down to that group of 12 in this
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:26,527	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And the first way is called striking
EDL	00:09:26,527	00:09:29,855	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Cause this type of me to excuse him for causing this time
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:36,255	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Tracking for cause is like when they ask you can you be fair in this case if you say you know Noah
EDL	00:09:36,255	00:09:40,607	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I really can't I really strong feelings about the people or the subject matter
EDL	00:09:40,607	00:09:45,727	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That's a strike for cause or it's like hey that lady who's sitting in the chair of the defendant
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:46,495	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That's some
EDL	00:09:47,007	00:09:47,519	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That's my cousin
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:49,311	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	We grew up together
EDL	00:09:49,311	00:09:51,871	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Roll a complex Venture Lane kombucha that's my boss
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,943	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	We go out every Saturday for brunch whatever it is
EDL	00:09:55,455	00:09:56,479	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You're too close to this
EDL	00:09:56,991	00:09:59,807	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You can't be fair got it so that one's cause
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:04,159	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That's pretty much common sense it makes sense to everyone but the second way is
EDL	00:10:04,159	00:10:06,719	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The heart of this whole matter this whole story
EDL	00:10:06,719	00:10:08,511	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It's called a peremptory challenge
EDL	00:10:09,279	00:10:11,327	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Preempt reroute
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:12,095	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Peremptory
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,655	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That's a word depending on how you punch it into Google
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:20,799	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It'll be like that's a type of a son what does it mean what is peremptory meet Brenda challenge means you get a certain number of straw
EDL	00:10:21,311	00:10:24,127	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Just to get rid of people you think might not be
EDL	00:10:24,639	00:10:25,919	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Fair to you
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:29,247	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But you can really use them anyway you want and but these
EDL	00:10:29,247	00:10:30,015	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Strikes
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:31,295	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You want to give any reason
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:33,343	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	How many days do you get
EDL	00:10:33,343	00:10:35,391	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So it varies from state-to-state in some states
EDL	00:10:35,391	00:10:36,671	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	20 in other states
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:37,439	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It's for
EDL	00:10:37,439	00:10:40,511	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	In Kentucky then and now each side gets
EDL	00:10:40,511	00:10:41,791	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	88 juror
EDL	00:10:42,303	00:10:48,703	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Did they just get to put the Exxon and say you're not going to sit on this trial hooker truck
EDL	00:10:48,703	00:10:51,007	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	They don't explain anything and this isn't just some
EDL	00:10:51,007	00:10:52,799	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Weird legal rules we made up
EDL	00:10:52,799	00:10:54,335	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Like 20 years ago this is something
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:55,359	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Has been around
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:10:57,151	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It's older than America
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:59,967	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Goes back to England in the 11th century
EDL	00:10:59,967	00:11:01,759	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And before that some say he goes back to like
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:05,343	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	104 BC Roman times really really
EDL	00:11:05,855	00:11:08,927	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And the idea is I feel like the visualization is like
EDL	00:11:08,927	00:11:09,439	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Seesaw
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,743	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Like okay
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:14,303	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	We need to get to this perfect group of 12 people and
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:20,703	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You know there's going to be people who are biased either side so each side gets the eliminate people you get three you get
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:22,239	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You get for you get for and then we'll
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:24,799	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Come to this balance in the jury
EDL	00:11:24,799	00:11:26,591	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	A group of people
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:27,871	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Port going to be fair
EDL	00:11:27,871	00:11:30,943	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Tilted their way from other side
EDL	00:11:30,943	00:11:37,087	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The thinking is Atlanta balance yet and also the thinking was that this would give outside more faith in the process and
EDL	00:11:37,087	00:11:38,111	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	At the same time
EDL	00:11:38,111	00:11:39,391	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Protect both sides
EDL	00:11:39,391	00:11:39,903	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	From
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,951	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Tyranny of a trial judge
EDL	00:11:41,951	00:11:42,463	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	How to hack
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:44,511	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Power cannot you're okay
EDL	00:11:44,511	00:11:47,327	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What happens in this case is the second trial begins
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:49,375	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Take me to the
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,143	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Mama Theresa
EDL	00:11:50,911	00:11:51,679	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Imagine early
EDL	00:11:51,679	00:11:53,215	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Yeah that's that's the first thing that
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:55,519	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Well
EDL	00:11:55,519	00:11:57,055	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The only people that were in the courtroom
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:12:01,663	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Were some family members of mr. Batson his attorney a detective
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:02,943	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And me
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:03,967	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And the jury
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:08,319	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So the reason we're talking about this case and Joe gottman and James Batson
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:12,159	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is because the next thing that happens is Joe Gutman gets up there
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:16,767	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He scans the jury pool and at this point he says there are 13 people left
EDL	00:12:16,767	00:12:17,791	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	For that were black
EDL	00:12:17,791	00:12:20,863	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	9 that were white and he uses his peremptory challenges
EDL	00:12:21,375	00:12:23,167	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The strike off 1
EDL	00:12:23,167	00:12:23,935	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	2
EDL	00:12:23,935	00:12:24,447	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	3
EDL	00:12:24,959	00:12:25,727	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	4
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:26,239	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Blacture
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:27,263	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	They're all gone
EDL	00:12:28,799	00:12:29,567	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Leaving all white
EDL	00:12:30,079	00:12:31,615	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Do you remember
EDL	00:12:31,615	00:12:32,383	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Striking
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:32,895	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	For minority
EDL	00:12:34,175	00:12:38,527	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Do I specifically remember
EDL	00:12:38,527	00:12:39,551	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The reason for each
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:41,343	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	No I don't
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:44,415	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I asked Joe was the reason because they were
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:45,183	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	In fact
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,463	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Black no
EDL	00:12:46,463	00:12:48,511	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I can see that they were not stricken
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:49,535	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Because of rice
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:51,327	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And I remember
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:54,655	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Specifically did one of the jurors lived in the neighborhood
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:59,263	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Yes exactly remember what his reasons were for all four black jurors but
EDL	00:12:59,263	00:13:05,151	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What's important for our story is to know that James Batson is sitting there in the room
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:07,455	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	As all of this is happening
EDL	00:13:07,967	00:13:12,319	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Just completely strikeout
EDL	00:13:12,319	00:13:14,111	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Damn right I told my lawyer
EDL	00:13:14,623	00:13:16,415	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Projector that you know
EDL	00:13:16,415	00:13:17,695	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Voices by rev jet
EDL	00:13:17,695	00:13:19,231	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	James said because
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:19,999	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Not fair
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:23,327	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He should know it's a long-standing rule he's allowed to do that
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:25,631	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Sprite what we want
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:26,911	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He was white
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:29,727	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He was white
EDL	00:13:29,727	00:13:35,615	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Inside nose for people that have just been struck off the jury they're burning the courtroom was white
EDL	00:13:36,383	00:13:38,431	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So again
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:43,295	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Jo Malone YouTube Jack and again
EDL	00:13:43,807	00:13:47,647	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What you mean you can't you work for me you do what I say you just check anyway
EDL	00:13:48,159	00:13:49,695	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I don't care as long standing rule
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:51,999	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And he did
EDL	00:13:53,023	00:13:55,327	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And it all came behind that one objection

EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:53,055	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This is like finally we figured out how to do this right
EDL	00:18:53,055	00:18:59,199	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	There was a system in place to protect everyone and that system was even extended to civil cases and eventually the women is
EDL	00:19:00,223	00:19:05,855	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It was a big deal when the case was decided and the initial elation
EDL	00:19:05,855	00:19:07,391	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Was quickly
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:08,159	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Tempered

EDL	00:20:02,175	00:20:08,319	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Women young black women are very bad there's an antagonism I guess maybe cuz they're downtrodden
EDL	00:20:10,879	00:20:17,023	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So there are downtrodden to areas and they somehow want to take it out on somebody and you don't want it to be you

EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:39,295	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Because that's what Batson required
EDL	00:20:39,295	00:20:44,415	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This is a racially neutral reason
EDL	00:20:44,415	00:20:47,231	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	When you do have a black shirt you question them at like and

EDL	00:21:13,599	00:21:15,391	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Put on the face where race-neutral
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:18,208	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Just say you're excluding them because they're too tall
EDL	00:21:18,720	00:21:25,120	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Are there 200 that person was wearing a black sweater things like well he lives in a bad neighborhood
EDL	00:21:25,120	00:21:29,984	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The person would maintain eye contact body language or they belong to a church
EDL	00:21:29,984	00:21:30,752	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Tattoos
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:31,776	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What are a nurse
EDL	00:21:31,776	00:21:33,824	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Any of those reasons have a markdown
EDL	00:21:33,824	00:21:39,200	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	As long as a prosecutor doesn't say I excused that person because they're black
EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:41,248	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That's some says it's completely okay
EDL	00:21:43,808	00:21:45,600	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I was actually working on a case
EDL	00:21:45,600	00:21:47,136	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This is lawyer Bryan Stevenson
EDL	00:21:47,648	00:21:52,000	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	My office said the time was called the southern Christmas depends who it is who's and I was in Atlanta Georgia
EDL	00:21:52,000	00:21:52,512	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Butterfly Boucher
EDL	00:21:53,536	00:21:55,072	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Alabama and when was this
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:56,096	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This is 1986
EDL	00:21:56,864	00:21:59,936	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And we were defending someone down in Swainsboro Georgia
EDL	00:21:59,936	00:22:01,216	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Guy by the name of Gamble
EDL	00:22:01,984	00:22:05,312	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And the bathroom decision came down
EDL	00:22:06,080	00:22:11,712	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I and objections were made with the prosecutor used his peremptory strikes exclude all of the African-American
EDL	00:22:12,480	00:22:16,064	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And we said wait a minute you're on if there's a new decision Batson vs Kentucky
EDL	00:22:16,064	00:22:17,600	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Which means that the prosecutor can't do this
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:23,488	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And the courts at while I read baton. What this means is the price going to have to give race-neutral reason
EDL	00:22:23,488	00:22:25,536	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The prosecution I've got my race-neutral Visa
EDL	00:22:26,304	00:22:28,352	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is Weis truck this woman
EDL	00:22:28,352	00:22:33,472	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Because she looks just like the defendant there was an African American man to wait a minute what is that
EDL	00:22:33,472	00:22:35,264	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	No she doesn't
EDL	00:22:36,032	00:22:38,592	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He said it's not judge that I see that you did
EDL	00:22:38,592	00:22:42,432	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What struck this man because he lives in South Waynesboro
EDL	00:22:42,944	00:22:43,968	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And that's where the defendant
EDL	00:22:44,736	00:22:48,064	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And we record the sale of all the black people live in South Waynesboro
EDL	00:22:48,576	00:22:49,344	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	All the way to
EDL	00:22:49,344	00:22:51,904	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That's not a reason to reason. You know that is erased
EDL	00:22:52,672	00:22:54,208	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He said I stop one person
EDL	00:22:54,720	00:22:57,536	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Because this man was in the military and he was discharged
EDL	00:22:58,048	00:22:59,840	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	After 5 years in the military
EDL	00:22:59,840	00:23:01,376	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And in my experience or honor
EDL	00:23:01,888	00:23:05,728	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You only get discharged honorably after an even number of years
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:11,360	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What a juror was put back on the stand was so where were you discharged from the military honorably yes I was
EDL	00:23:11,360	00:23:12,640	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I was actually decorated
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:15,456	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I got this metal I got this award I got these things
EDL	00:23:15,456	00:23:17,248	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Well I still accept the Prosecco
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,528	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Kids reading for excluding that
EDL	00:23:18,528	00:23:20,064	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	A person my favorite was
EDL	00:23:20,832	00:23:25,696	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The prosecution gets better
EDL	00:23:25,696	00:23:28,000	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This man because he testified
EDL	00:23:28,000	00:23:29,280	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That he was a mason
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:33,632	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Any said you're on I just don't want anybody who's a member of a masonic lodge
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:37,472	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	All my jewelry they have their own code their own rituals are all culture
EDL	00:23:37,472	00:23:37,984	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I don't want that
EDL	00:23:38,496	00:23:43,104	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The jury was put back on the stand we asked her are you a member of the Masonic Lodge
EDL	00:23:43,104	00:23:45,408	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I've never said no I'm not he said I'm a brick mason
EDL	00:23:45,920	00:23:51,808	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And the judge says I still know what you mean I'll let you exclude that person right
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:55,392	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And so almost from the very beginning there was this
EDL	00:23:55,392	00:23:58,464	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Cynicism this gameplay I used to tell people
EDL	00:23:58,464	00:24:01,536	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Bath is not going to eliminate racial bias in jury selection
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:05,632	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But it will make the jury selection process a lot more entertaining
EDL	00:24:05,632	00:24:08,448	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Y'all should come to court and just watch the show
EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:14,336	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So you not only did Batson
EDL	00:24:14,336	00:24:17,408	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Not change anything but that's in made things worse
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:23,040	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Steven breit put to me is basically
EDL	00:24:23,040	00:24:25,088	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Set of procedures
EDL	00:24:25,088	00:24:29,952	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Two sortilege enemies and cover up the race discrimination that's going on
EDL	00:24:31,232	00:24:32,000	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You had this
EDL	00:24:32,000	00:24:35,584	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Smelly putrid problem of racial discrimination in jury selection
EDL	00:24:36,096	00:24:37,120	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And instead of
EDL	00:24:37,120	00:24:38,144	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Tossing it out
EDL	00:24:38,144	00:24:38,656	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	We just
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,448	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Sprayed Febreeze
EDL	00:24:40,448	00:24:42,496	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It's kind of perfume
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,800	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Vaguely cheap cologne it's still there
EDL	00:24:45,568	00:24:46,848	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Begley hidden
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:49,152	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And now with the Batson rule
EDL	00:24:49,664	00:24:51,456	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	If you think the prosecution or the
EDL	00:24:51,456	00:24:54,272	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Defense is striking people off because of race
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:56,576	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You have to call them out and then you have to
EDL	00:24:57,088	00:24:57,856	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Somehow
EDL	00:24:57,856	00:25:01,184	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Try and prove that the reason they're providing is a lie
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:02,208	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And that's
EDL	00:25:02,720	00:25:03,488	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Really really Tiff
EDL	00:25:05,792	00:25:06,560	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Since
EDL	00:25:06,560	00:25:09,888	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	1986 Ford xample in the state of Washington
EDL	00:25:09,888	00:25:10,656	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	There been
EDL	00:25:11,168	00:25:17,312	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Probably 4748 challenges on baton issues where people have been convicted make said waiting
EDL	00:25:17,824	00:25:19,616	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The prosecutors were excusing
EDL	00:25:19,616	00:25:21,408	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	People of color from the jury
EDL	00:25:21,408	00:25:22,944	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Because they were people of color
EDL	00:25:23,456	00:25:27,296	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Out of those 46 250 challenges there's been one
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,064	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	River
EDL	00:25:28,064	00:25:30,880	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The state of Tennessee has not reversed a single case
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:32,672	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Under Batson
EDL	00:25:32,672	00:25:36,000	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And the 30 years for it's inside the Baton decision came out
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:42,656	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	As a result he says there still many counties in America where the diversity of the jury is not increase
EDL	00:25:42,656	00:25:43,680	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Very much at all
EDL	00:25:45,728	00:25:49,056	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So for example in one Louisiana Parish they looked a felony cases
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:50,848	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is over an eight-year period
EDL	00:25:50,848	00:25:52,896	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And found it nearly half the black jurors
EDL	00:25:53,408	00:25:53,920	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Horse track
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,480	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Houston County Alabama
EDL	00:25:56,480	00:25:58,016	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Over a five-year period
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:26:01,600	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The date established at 80% of the African Americans qualify for jury service
EDL	00:26:03,904	00:26:08,512	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	80% 80% and that's in death penalty cases so
EDL	00:26:08,512	00:26:11,328	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I mean if you think about that like a big percent of time Deezer
EDL	00:26:11,328	00:26:12,608	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Lawyers who are
EDL	00:26:12,608	00:26:14,912	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Going around the bathroom rule going on the Block
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:18,496	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Going on the Constitution to get these all-white juries
EDL	00:26:19,008	00:26:21,056	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Who are then oftentimes pudding
EDL	00:26:21,056	00:26:21,824	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Black
EDL	00:26:21,824	00:26:22,592	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Mint
EDL	00:26:22,592	00:26:23,104	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	To death
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:24,128	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:25,664	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That reminds you some pretty dark
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:29,504	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Super Bass
EDL	00:26:31,808	00:26:32,320	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I mean
EDL	00:26:34,112	00:26:34,624	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That video
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:35,648	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Training video
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,696	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The assumption that video is it
EDL	00:26:37,696	00:26:38,464	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Having black
EDL	00:26:38,464	00:26:39,232	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	People on the tree
EDL	00:26:39,232	00:26:40,256	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Would hurt that guy
EDL	00:26:40,256	00:26:40,768	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Would hurt the
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:42,048	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Yeah
EDL	00:26:43,328	00:26:44,352	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Show me Justice
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:45,888	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Assume that orbit is there any
EDL	00:26:45,888	00:26:47,680	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Any data that would say that's even remotely
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:49,984	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Be true the hardest thing about looking at this stuff
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:51,264	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Analytically
EDL	00:26:51,776	00:26:52,544	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The juries are like
EDL	00:26:53,056	00:26:53,568	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Black Box
EDL	00:26:54,592	00:26:55,616	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	They don't let
EDL	00:26:55,616	00:26:56,128	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Journalist
EDL	00:26:56,640	00:26:58,688	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Academics in
EDL	00:26:58,688	00:26:59,200	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Often
EDL	00:26:59,712	00:27:00,480	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Study
EDL	00:27:00,480	00:27:01,504	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What's going on
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:02,528	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Two trees kind of sacred that
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:03,808	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Yeah but
EDL	00:27:03,808	00:27:05,856	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The few times we've gotten data like to do
EDL	00:27:05,856	00:27:07,392	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This group called the capital jury brought
EDL	00:27:07,392	00:27:08,160	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That looks it
EDL	00:27:08,160	00:27:08,928	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Data speed
EDL	00:27:08,928	00:27:09,952	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	SafeLink application
EDL	00:27:09,952	00:27:11,488	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Because that's where the stuff ends up being like
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:12,000	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Life or death
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,048	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So they looked at data in
EDL	00:27:14,048	00:27:16,608	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Like 350 cases in 14 States
EDL	00:27:17,120	00:27:19,424	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Over a number of years and they found that
EDL	00:27:20,192	00:27:21,216	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	White man
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:27,616	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Are more likely to go for the death penalty than black men when you get to sentencing that number that the difference between
EDL	00:27:27,616	00:27:29,152	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	White and black is really exaggerated
EDL	00:27:29,920	00:27:30,688	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	White men are
EDL	00:27:30,688	00:27:33,504	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Are seven times more likely to want the death penalty
EDL	00:27:33,504	00:27:34,272	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is in a black person
EDL	00:27:34,272	00:27:36,320	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	There's another study that was done in Florida
EDL	00:27:36,320	00:27:40,160	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Amazon look at felony cases over like 10 years and
EDL	00:27:40,160	00:27:40,928	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	They found that
EDL	00:27:40,928	00:27:42,208	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	All-white jury pools
EDL	00:27:42,208	00:27:44,000	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	In Florida convicted black defendants
EDL	00:27:44,000	00:27:45,024	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	16
EDL	00:27:45,024	00:27:45,792	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Percent
EDL	00:27:45,792	00:27:46,304	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	More often
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:53,216	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Okay but was really interesting is that Gap was practically eliminated when at least one member of the jury pool
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:55,520	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Black Interstate but one black person
EDL	00:27:55,520	00:27:56,544	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And that difference
EDL	00:27:57,568	00:27:59,104	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Yeah and catastrophes
EDL	00:27:59,104	00:28:00,128	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Why I mean
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:02,688	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Types of criminal cases
EDL	00:28:02,688	00:28:05,504	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Usually involve cops and the reason is often cited is
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:07,296	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That nope black
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,832	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Jurors are less likely
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:09,600	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	To believe
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,392	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Cops
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:13,184	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Bikers are more likely to
EDL	00:28:13,184	00:28:14,720	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Insert some sense of

EDL	00:28:15,488	00:28:16,000	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Into

EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:22,144	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And almost everyone talked to
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,936	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Gave me a version of this
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:26,752	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That that you know we have black going to jury to deliberate more
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:30,592	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And that black people are less likely to trust law enforcement especially
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:31,616	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Jack McMahon
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:36,736	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Who was the guy we heard from in that video

EDL	00:29:40,224	00:29:40,736	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Well I guess
EDL	00:29:41,504	00:29:45,088	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I see the argument that you know use your friend challenges

EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:02,752	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I don't think so
EDL	00:30:03,264	00:30:05,056	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Not at all because
EDL	00:30:05,056	00:30:06,336	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It's not because of
EDL	00:30:06,336	00:30:07,104	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The color of their skin
EDL	00:30:08,384	00:30:09,664	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Cause of there

EDL	00:30:10,944	00:30:11,456	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And where

EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:20,672	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I think those Facts of Life in those societal
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:22,464	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Demographical Concepts
EDL	00:30:22,464	00:30:24,512	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	All stem from the color of
EDL	00:30:24,512	00:30:27,584	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Their skin
EDL	00:30:27,584	00:30:29,632	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Maybe a deeper issue that we can't deal with
EDL	00:30:29,632	00:30:30,400	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Jury selection
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,424	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But you're right
EDL	00:30:31,424	00:30:32,704	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But the reality is
EDL	00:30:33,216	00:30:35,776	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The reality is that that that that's what this
EDL	00:30:35,776	00:30:37,312	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Situation is so
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:39,360	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So you're saying that if you're the prosecutor you
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,896	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You should stay out for this guy will probably be worse.
EDL	00:30:41,408	00:30:42,688	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	For me he probably
EDL	00:30:43,200	00:30:46,528	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Believe those cops online but I'm going to take him because I want to uphold the
EDL	00:30:49,856	00:30:51,392	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	There is no prosecutor in the country
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:54,976	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I want to I want to show my altruism
EDL	00:30:54,976	00:30:56,768	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And I'm going to keep this guy on my

EDL	00:30:57,792	00:30:58,304	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Believe my

EDL	00:31:00,352	00:31:01,632	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Because I want to be altruistic

EDL	00:32:04,352	00:32:04,864	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I think we should
EDL	00:32:05,376	00:32:11,776	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It's because of a case it was in front of the Supreme Court this term in case 1483

EDL	00:32:14,336	00:32:15,616	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So basic facts
EDL	00:32:15,616	00:32:17,664	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This is a murder case in Georgia
EDL	00:32:17,664	00:32:24,064	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	A younger black man kills an elderly white woman the prosecutors dismiss a bunch of black Jersey
EDL	00:32:24,064	00:32:27,648	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is and the defense having this new Batson rule says hold up
EDL	00:32:28,160	00:32:28,672	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Can't do that
EDL	00:32:29,184	00:32:30,464	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And prosecutors give
EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:33,536	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	These race-neutral reasons and the judge says
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:34,304	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That looks good to me
EDL	00:32:36,096	00:32:40,704	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Years later something sort of incredible happens through like one of those Freedom of Information Act
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:42,496	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Type things
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,776	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The defense actually gets
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:45,312	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	See the notes
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:46,592	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Prosecution
EDL	00:32:46,592	00:32:47,104	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Should had
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,384	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	During the
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:50,176	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Trial the notes they kept her in
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:56,320	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Jury selection this is one of those rare times when we pull back the curtain and we find out what the prosecutors were doing
EDL	00:32:56,320	00:33:01,696	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This is lawyer Steven breit he actually argued Foster case in front of Supreme Court late last year
EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:06,048	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And he says what you saw these notes was that the prosecution
EDL	00:33:06,048	00:33:09,888	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	They literally wrote a little B next to the name
EDL	00:33:09,888	00:33:14,496	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Each and every black juror B1 B2 B3
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:20,896	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Highlighting all the black sand in in green on the list of all the people summoned for jury
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:23,968	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Racial discrimination is really hard to prove
EDL	00:33:23,968	00:33:26,784	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This is actual physical proof
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:33,184	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	In a file in the state like this is the Smoking Gun we've been waiting for so what are the what are the prosecutor
EDL	00:33:33,184	00:33:34,976	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	How did the prosecution argue in front of
EDL	00:33:34,976	00:33:38,304	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Prosecution was like you know what actually wants an ultrasound they said
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:42,656	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	We were just riding those bees because we wanted to make sure we notice
EDL	00:33:42,656	00:33:44,960	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The black jurors you want to keep track of them
EDL	00:33:44,960	00:33:47,264	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	4 months
EDL	00:33:47,264	00:33:53,152	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Project trial defense counsel
EDL	00:33:53,664	00:33:55,968	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That's lawyer representing Georgia Beth Burton
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:34:00,576	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And she saying of course we're going to notice race this is the post Batson world end
EDL	00:34:00,576	00:34:02,880	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	We're going to no trace and we're going to write it down
EDL	00:34:02,880	00:34:09,280	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I would be more surprised quite frankly if there wasn't some sort of highlighting or
EDL	00:34:09,280	00:34:13,376	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is that the reason he highlighted
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:15,424	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Actors in green
EDL	00:34:15,424	00:34:16,960	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He being the original prosecutor
EDL	00:34:19,264	00:34:21,824	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What about the black jurors and did all these different things
EDL	00:34:22,336	00:34:24,640	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Was because he was preparing defense in case
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:28,224	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Correct. Justice Breyer asking
EDL	00:34:28,224	00:34:29,760	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Well why didn't you make that
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:31,296	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Argument
EDL	00:34:31,296	00:34:32,064	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Like
EDL	00:34:32,064	00:34:34,624	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	When the case was actually happening the years and years ago
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:40,768	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What isn't a little surprising
EDL	00:34:41,536	00:34:42,560	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But he never thought of it
EDL	00:34:43,072	00:34:47,168	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Didn't tell anybody
EDL	00:34:49,984	00:34:51,264	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I would say that's on
EDL	00:34:53,824	00:34:55,616	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The good news is that
EDL	00:34:57,664	00:34:59,712	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	In a 7 to 1 decision this
EDL	00:34:59,712	00:35:00,736	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Supreme Court agreed
EDL	00:35:00,736	00:35:01,504	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That
EDL	00:35:01,504	00:35:03,040	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is prosecutors reasons War
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:04,832	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Utterly ridiculous
EDL	00:35:04,832	00:35:08,160	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I'm just going to ask you
EDL	00:35:08,160	00:35:10,720	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Violation
EDL	00:35:11,744	00:35:12,768	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That's Justice Kagan
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:14,560	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I don't think it is
EDL	00:35:15,072	00:35:16,096	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is that
EDL	00:35:17,376	00:35:19,680	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This case was in front of supreme court at all
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:23,520	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Good at to get appealed up to the highest court in the land
EDL	00:35:23,520	00:35:24,800	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Before someone said
EDL	00:35:24,800	00:35:26,592	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Oh yeah that's about annihilation
EDL	00:35:26,592	00:35:27,616	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That's how hard it is
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:31,712	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And the Supreme Court though it made a forceful
EDL	00:35:31,712	00:35:32,992	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Decision 7 out of 8
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:34,528	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Didn't make a new rule
EDL	00:35:35,808	00:35:38,880	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This is not works offer up
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:41,952	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Datsun 2.0 or didn't double down or throw it out or
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,720	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You send me Ruel
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:45,280	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	No they said this is really wrong but
EDL	00:35:45,792	00:35:47,072	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Didn't go as far to say
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:48,352	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Because it doesn't work
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:49,632	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So we still got bats
EDL	00:35:51,936	00:35:55,008	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So okay if we want to diverse juries and
EDL	00:35:55,008	00:35:55,776	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	We know that Batson
EDL	00:35:56,288	00:35:56,800	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Work
EDL	00:35:58,080	00:35:58,848	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What do we do
EDL	00:35:59,360	00:36:00,128	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So I asked
EDL	00:36:00,128	00:36:01,408	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Everyone I talked to
EDL	00:36:01,408	00:36:01,920	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That question
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:04,480	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Got a lot of different answers
EDL	00:36:04,480	00:36:05,248	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But this was the obvious
EDL	00:36:05,760	00:36:06,528	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Amanda Nance
EDL	00:36:06,528	00:36:08,320	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Margaret was a professor of law
EDL	00:36:08,320	00:36:09,344	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	IIT
EDL	00:36:09,344	00:36:10,112	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Chicago Kent
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:11,136	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	College of Law
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:12,672	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What I'd like to
EDL	00:36:12,672	00:36:13,440	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The court to do
EDL	00:36:13,440	00:36:14,720	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is eliminate
EDL	00:36:14,720	00:36:17,536	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Peremptory challenges who is a no-brainer
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:19,840	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Again steambrite is a lawyer we have to
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:23,168	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Supreme Court gives you these rules
EDL	00:36:23,680	00:36:24,704	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Appropriate challenges
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:27,008	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And then says
EDL	00:36:27,008	00:36:33,408	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Well wait a minute don't just break people you know you were going to look into all the ways that you strike the people wouldn't give him at all that for crying out loud
EDL	00:36:33,408	00:36:37,760	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Simple even Jack man the guy from that training video he was open to
EDL	00:36:37,760	00:36:44,160	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	We've had 30 years of experiment with Batson and it's not working
EDL	00:36:44,160	00:36:50,560	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	We now have to go the route that Justice Marshall suggested back in Batson
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:56,960	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So in the bathroom decision you got Thurgood Marshall
EDL	00:36:56,960	00:37:02,592	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Marshall like the most important attorney in the Civil Rights Movement turn the first black Supreme Court Justice
EDL	00:37:02,592	00:37:04,384	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Key in the same paragraph
EDL	00:37:04,384	00:37:05,920	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Call the Baton decision
EDL	00:37:05,920	00:37:06,688	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Historic
EDL	00:37:07,200	00:37:11,296	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And then said this isn't going to work this decision isn't going to do anything
EDL	00:37:11,296	00:37:15,392	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He was basically a fortune teller he said both those things in the same breath
EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:18,976	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	In one paragraph he starts about going this decision today
EDL	00:37:18,976	00:37:19,744	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Historic
EDL	00:37:19,744	00:37:21,024	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	By the end of the paragraph
EDL	00:37:21,024	00:37:24,096	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You're never going to fix this until you get rid of print through town
EDL	00:37:24,096	00:37:30,496	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Set an alarm for 9 breakfast just do away with broom tri-strike
EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:34,336	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Constitution
EDL	00:37:34,336	00:37:36,128	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	1st Ave
EDL	00:37:36,128	00:37:37,920	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Art denied
EDL	00:37:38,432	00:37:44,832	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Peremptory challenge
EDL	00:37:44,832	00:37:46,368	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Peremptory challenges
EDL	00:37:46,368	00:37:52,256	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You will have discrimination but what surprised me most and Reporting this story is that like I talk to people
EDL	00:37:53,024	00:37:57,632	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	On the left side of the criminal justice system on the right side of Criminal Justice is ACLU types
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:37:59,936	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Law professors academics
EDL	00:37:59,936	00:38:02,496	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Conservative prosecutors
EDL	00:38:03,008	00:38:06,848	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Guys we got to get rid of printer challenges right almost every single one
EDL	00:38:06,848	00:38:08,128	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Will say no
EDL	00:38:08,128	00:38:09,152	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	No
EDL	00:38:09,152	00:38:15,552	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Crucially important to organisms it's an easy solution just get rid of
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:16,832	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Peremptory Sahel
EDL	00:38:17,344	00:38:23,488	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Italian style are legal editor law professor sunwolf from Santa Clara University and lawyer David niehaus again
EDL	00:38:23,488	00:38:25,536	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And here's one of the arguments
EDL	00:38:26,048	00:38:31,680	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	If you take these things away all the decisions about striking jurors would be made by the judge
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:37,568	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	On the question whether Jerry could be fair and impartial and for that to work you have to have a fair job
EDL	00:38:38,336	00:38:39,104	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And
EDL	00:38:39,104	00:38:41,152	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	There are an awful lot of judges
EDL	00:38:41,152	00:38:42,176	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Who aren't there
EDL	00:38:42,176	00:38:44,480	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Here's another argument I heard from Jeffrey Robbins
EDL	00:38:44,480	00:38:45,248	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Jason from the ACLU
EDL	00:38:45,248	00:38:48,064	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And this is based on my experience
EDL	00:38:48,064	00:38:49,600	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	34 years in the criminal justice
EDL	00:38:50,368	00:38:54,720	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Jeff Robinson says if you can find some way to take race out of the equation
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:56,000	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Parentheses
EDL	00:38:56,000	00:38:57,280	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Super useful
EDL	00:38:57,280	00:38:58,560	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Call Annie told me about this one
EDL	00:38:58,560	00:39:00,352	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Case very high-profile homicide
EDL	00:39:00,864	00:39:01,632	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Lakes in the state of Washington
EDL	00:39:02,656	00:39:03,424	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	This case
EDL	00:39:03,424	00:39:05,728	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Was incredibly complicated and also
EDL	00:39:06,240	00:39:07,776	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Potentially involved
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:09,824	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	A coerced confession
EDL	00:39:09,824	00:39:11,360	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Buy some undercover cop
EDL	00:39:11,360	00:39:12,128	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Sand
EDL	00:39:12,128	00:39:13,920	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	There's a police officer on the jury pay
EDL	00:39:14,688	00:39:15,456	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He says
EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:16,736	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I can be fair
EDL	00:39:16,736	00:39:19,040	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I know the police officers that investigated this
EDL	00:39:19,808	00:39:21,344	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I've worked with him before
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:23,904	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I think they're really good people but don't worry
EDL	00:39:23,904	00:39:24,928	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I can be fair
EDL	00:39:24,928	00:39:26,464	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Everything about his back
EDL	00:39:27,232	00:39:28,000	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Was saying
EDL	00:39:28,512	00:39:31,072	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I do not want this man to serve on this
EDL	00:39:31,072	00:39:33,120	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But he was saying
EDL	00:39:33,120	00:39:34,144	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I can be fair
EDL	00:39:34,912	00:39:36,704	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I could not exclude him
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:37,984	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Moana challenge
EDL	00:39:37,984	00:39:38,496	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Call
EDL	00:39:39,264	00:39:40,032	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Why not
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:46,432	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Because he said he could be fair the fact that he's a police officer doesn't mean he can't be fair but isn't saying I'm
EDL	00:39:46,432	00:39:52,832	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I know some of these people involved in this case enough to get him dismissed for cause it's enough to get more questioning but how well
EDL	00:39:52,832	00:39:53,856	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	How do you know I'm not very well
EDL	00:39:54,368	00:39:57,952	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So you saying that case if you said okay. Like to dismiss jurors 17-4
EDL	00:39:57,952	00:40:00,000	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	For cause the judge would say there's not a record
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:02,560	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I don't think any judge in this country
EDL	00:40:02,560	00:40:04,864	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What dismiss that juror for cause
EDL	00:40:04,864	00:40:07,424	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And so a peremptory challenge is important
EDL	00:40:07,936	00:40:08,704	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So
EDL	00:40:08,704	00:40:09,984	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I've watched
EDL	00:40:09,984	00:40:13,824	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	More jury selection videos on YouTube than any person
EDL	00:40:13,824	00:40:15,616	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Evershed and
EDL	00:40:16,128	00:40:18,176	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It's this amazing thing where you see these people
EDL	00:40:18,176	00:40:20,736	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But not necessarily used to being in a courtroom
EDL	00:40:20,736	00:40:25,600	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	There's certainly not used to be grilled in public by a bunch of people in suits
EDL	00:40:25,600	00:40:27,392	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Take it up there to the jury panel
EDL	00:40:27,392	00:40:32,512	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And they got to ask these questions in the trial
EDL	00:40:33,024	00:40:35,328	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Over and over again
EDL	00:40:35,840	00:40:41,984	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Can you be carrying a partial
EDL	00:40:43,776	00:40:45,056	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Nobody says no
EDL	00:40:45,568	00:40:46,592	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Everyone feels like
EDL	00:40:46,592	00:40:49,920	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Yes I can be fair
EDL	00:40:50,432	00:40:54,016	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I'm thinking I could I can be totally unbiased
EDL	00:40:54,016	00:40:58,368	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I think some of them believe that they can actually do this nearly impossible task
EDL	00:40:58,368	00:41:02,976	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And others they know they can't but they might say yes anyway
EDL	00:41:02,976	00:41:04,000	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Believe me
EDL	00:41:04,000	00:41:05,280	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Knows the bias Jersey
EDL	00:41:05,792	00:41:12,192	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Comment they don't reveal things they lie about things for people that when you're questioned them in a jury that you know they're lying to you
EDL	00:41:12,192	00:41:16,800	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Trying to get onto jewelry or trying to get off the jury bias people are being allowed to serve
EDL	00:41:16,800	00:41:21,664	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So any tools that can help reduce the number of biased years on Jerry
EDL	00:41:22,176	00:41:23,200	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is essential to just
EDL	00:41:24,992	00:41:26,528	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So yeah if you got a really
EDL	00:41:26,528	00:41:32,928	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Crappie outlook on chores and humans then maybe you need more front through challenges but the way Jackie Robinson put it to me was that if you're using parentheses
EDL	00:41:32,928	00:41:34,208	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Challenges the right way
EDL	00:41:34,208	00:41:35,744	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It forces you to be like
EDL	00:41:35,744	00:41:37,280	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Equal opportunity
EDL	00:41:37,280	00:41:37,792	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Suspicious
EDL	00:41:38,304	00:41:38,816	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Suspicious of
EDL	00:41:39,840	00:41:40,352	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Everyone
EDL	00:41:40,864	00:41:41,632	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And that's
EDL	00:41:42,144	00:41:42,912	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The only way to be fair
EDL	00:41:43,424	00:41:44,192	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	My parents
EDL	00:41:44,704	00:41:45,472	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	We're both
EDL	00:41:45,472	00:41:48,288	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Active in the civil rights movement in Memphis Tennessee
EDL	00:41:48,288	00:41:50,848	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is activist to people you could ever want to meet
EDL	00:41:50,848	00:41:51,616	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Both black
EDL	00:41:53,151	00:41:55,455	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I would never let my mother
EDL	00:41:55,455	00:41:57,503	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Sit on a criminal defense jury
EDL	00:41:58,015	00:42:01,343	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Because my mother is being about black defendants was
EDL	00:42:01,343	00:42:04,415	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You're the reason I have to lock the door in my neighborhood
EDL	00:42:04,415	00:42:07,743	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You're the reason that I get disrespected when I go out into the
EDL	00:42:07,743	00:42:08,511	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Community
EDL	00:42:08,511	00:42:10,047	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And I'm going to take it out on you
EDL	00:42:10,559	00:42:12,351	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	My father's position
EDL	00:42:12,351	00:42:13,119	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Would be
EDL	00:42:13,119	00:42:18,751	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I wouldn't believe a police officer if he told me it was raining and the water was coming down on my head
EDL	00:42:18,751	00:42:20,543	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And so what this is about
EDL	00:42:20,543	00:42:21,311	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is
EDL	00:42:21,311	00:42:22,079	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Actually
EDL	00:42:22,847	00:42:24,895	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Putting into effect what the rules
EDL	00:42:24,895	00:42:25,663	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Say
EDL	00:42:25,663	00:42:28,479	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Talk to jurors and find out what they think
EDL	00:42:28,479	00:42:30,271	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But what about Thurgood Marshall the idea that
EDL	00:42:30,783	00:42:31,551	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	You know
EDL	00:42:31,551	00:42:37,695	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	If you have renter challenges if you give people a way to discriminate they will discriminate well
EDL	00:42:39,231	00:42:41,023	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I was born in 1956
EDL	00:42:41,535	00:42:46,655	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	It's on 1954 Thurgood Marshall argued Brown versus the Board of Education
EDL	00:42:47,167	00:42:47,679	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Which
EDL	00:42:48,191	00:42:51,519	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Had a significant impact on my life
EDL	00:42:51,519	00:42:57,663	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Thurgood Marshall with someone that I have respected and someone I have admired virtually my entire life
EDL	00:42:58,175	00:43:02,527	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But I can't agree with him that I want all peremptory challenges eliminated
EDL	00:43:03,295	00:43:05,855	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And why do you think Thurgood Marshall Justice Marshall
EDL	00:43:05,855	00:43:09,695	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Went straight to no print Justice Marshall concluded that
EDL	00:43:09,695	00:43:12,255	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He did not have faith in America
EDL	00:43:13,023	00:43:15,071	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	To be able to make these kind of
EDL	00:43:16,095	00:43:16,863	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And
EDL	00:43:16,863	00:43:18,143	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I understand why you concluded that
EDL	00:43:18,655	00:43:20,191	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And you do you have that face
EDL	00:43:23,519	00:43:24,287	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I still do
EDL	00:43:25,823	00:43:27,871	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And how long that will last I don't know
EDL	00:43:27,871	00:43:29,663	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But I still do right now
EDL	00:43:36,063	00:43:37,599	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Robinson says that
EDL	00:43:37,599	00:43:42,975	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	To give up on these parentheses is like giving up on who we might be one day
EDL	00:43:43,487	00:43:44,511	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Because of
EDL	00:43:44,511	00:43:45,535	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Who we are right now
EDL	00:43:46,047	00:43:46,815	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That's
EDL	00:43:46,815	00:43:47,839	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Conceding
EDL	00:43:47,839	00:43:52,191	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	That we are so divided by race that we will never be able
EDL	00:43:52,191	00:43:53,471	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	To try and fix it
EDL	00:43:53,471	00:43:55,263	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And I'm not prepared to concede that
EDL	00:44:00,127	00:44:02,687	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Okay one last thing for my trip to Louisville
EDL	00:44:04,223	00:44:04,991	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What's up Shane
EDL	00:44:06,783	00:44:07,807	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	All right
EDL	00:44:09,343	00:44:10,111	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Thunder blew me away
EDL	00:44:11,135	00:44:14,207	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	But I'm Joe Gutman I'm a teacher at Central High School
EDL	00:44:14,207	00:44:15,743	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Also an attorney at law
EDL	00:44:15,743	00:44:19,071	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I'm James Batson truck driver and
EDL	00:44:19,071	00:44:21,375	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Construction worker amongst other things
EDL	00:44:21,375	00:44:23,167	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I probably should add that on the
EDL	00:44:23,167	00:44:24,959	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Former prosecutor
EDL	00:44:24,959	00:44:25,727	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Best suitcases
EDL	00:44:27,007	00:44:33,151	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Joe gottman and James Batson those two people whose conflict in a courtroom back in 1983 gave us the bathroom
EDL	00:44:34,687	00:44:36,991	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	They are now in 2016
EDL	00:44:37,503	00:44:38,015	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Prince
EDL	00:44:39,039	00:44:41,599	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I'll talk to him about time you have to
EDL	00:44:41,599	00:44:46,207	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Yep we're friends now how often is it that a prosecutor becomes friends with someone
EDL	00:44:46,719	00:44:47,999	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He helped convince
EDL	00:44:49,023	00:44:52,351	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Not not often I mean retired from a
EDL	00:44:52,863	00:44:55,679	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Prosecuting Austin 2001
EDL	00:44:55,679	00:44:56,959	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Ed Cena
EDL	00:44:57,983	00:44:59,263	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Too many awful things
EDL	00:45:00,287	00:45:05,407	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	To make a long story short it was time for me to do something else
EDL	00:45:05,407	00:45:08,223	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And starts teaching at a high school in Louisville
EDL	00:45:08,223	00:45:09,503	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	80% black
EDL	00:45:09,503	00:45:11,807	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Where do we wear
EDL	00:45:11,807	00:45:14,111	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Posing drug testing covered on Asuna side
EDL	00:45:14,879	00:45:15,903	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Jackson
EDL	00:45:16,927	00:45:18,463	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Well drug testing in schools
EDL	00:45:18,975	00:45:21,279	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Seems like a good idea but in actuality
EDL	00:45:21,791	00:45:26,399	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	So the day I visited Joe gottman's classroom which is like a full-on Mach
EDL	00:45:26,399	00:45:28,447	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Courtroom in a classroom
EDL	00:45:28,447	00:45:29,727	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He's doing his mock trials with
EDL	00:45:32,287	00:45:33,823	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Not be allowed in school
EDL	00:45:33,823	00:45:36,383	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	School says no funding for what it's all said and done
EDL	00:45:36,895	00:45:38,431	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	I would prefer to be known
EDL	00:45:38,943	00:45:40,479	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	More 4
EDL	00:45:40,479	00:45:41,759	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	The accomplishments in this

EDL	00:45:42,783	00:45:45,087	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Jennifer Batson
EDL	00:45:46,623	00:45:49,951	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	As for James a baton case
EDL	00:45:50,463	00:45:53,023	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Eventually died from illegal
EDL	00:45:53,023	00:45:54,303	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Activities
EDL	00:45:54,303	00:45:55,327	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Andy Roebuck
EDL	00:45:55,327	00:45:56,863	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	War on jail
EDL	00:45:57,375	00:45:58,143	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Concept
EDL	00:45:58,655	00:45:59,679	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Me trying to get people
EDL	00:45:59,679	00:46:00,959	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Stop doing crime
EDL	00:46:00,959	00:46:02,495	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And the books actually how they
EDL	00:46:02,495	00:46:05,311	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	To sort of met up again one day a few years ago
EDL	00:46:05,311	00:46:08,127	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	James came to Jose school to give him a copy
EDL	00:46:08,127	00:46:14,527	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	He gave me a copy of his book and asked me if I'd look over it I wanted his opinion on it I read the book that night actually
EDL	00:46:14,527	00:46:15,295	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And he got
EDL	00:46:15,295	00:46:16,063	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	50 books
EDL	00:46:16,063	00:46:17,855	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Into the school system here in Jeff
EDL	00:46:17,855	00:46:18,367	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	County now
EDL	00:46:22,207	00:46:23,999	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What happened in the past is in the past
EDL	00:46:24,767	00:46:27,583	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	30 years ago he did what he did I did what I did
EDL	00:46:28,863	00:46:29,375	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Let It Go
EDL	00:46:29,887	00:46:34,239	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	As far as a legacy the Batson challenge goes it's really interesting to hear them talk about it
EDL	00:46:34,751	00:46:35,775	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Especially because
EDL	00:46:35,775	00:46:38,335	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	In the eyes of a lot of people who know these issues
EDL	00:46:38,847	00:46:41,919	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Joe was a villain that was always the painful part about
EDL	00:46:42,943	00:46:43,711	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Decision advances
EDL	00:46:44,223	00:46:45,759	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Is the label of being erased

EDL	00:46:46,783	00:46:47,551	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	What does that mean
EDL	00:46:47,551	00:46:49,343	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Well that was a horrible label
EDL	00:46:50,111	00:46:51,391	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Yeah I mean so horrible
EDL	00:46:51,903	00:46:53,183	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Butt bouncing

EDL	00:47:17,503	00:47:20,063	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	Maybe if Robinson's right we can look at all this
EDL	00:47:20,063	00:47:20,831	| moreperfect071616_objectanyway |	And
