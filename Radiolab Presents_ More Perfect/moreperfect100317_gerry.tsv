EDL	00:00:15,360	00:00:19,968	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Not an entire more perfect story just something that you need to know right now
EDL	00:00:19,968	00:00:25,600	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Supreme Court's about to hear a case that apparently could turn the country's legislative map
EDL	00:00:25,600	00:00:26,624	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Upside down

EDL	00:00:33,280	00:00:34,304	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Hello America
EDL	00:00:34,304	00:00:39,168	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So what's up with some contacts Republicans controlled a lot of legislators in 2010
EDL	00:00:39,680	00:00:41,472	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And there was also a sense of
EDL	00:00:41,472	00:00:42,240	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Does that year
EDL	00:00:42,240	00:00:44,288	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Which meant that a whole lot of Republicans
EDL	00:00:44,288	00:00:47,360	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Got to redraw a whole lot of legislative Maps
EDL	00:00:47,872	00:00:49,664	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And a lot of those Mavs benefited
EDL	00:00:50,176	00:00:50,688	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Republican
EDL	00:00:51,712	00:00:52,736	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Democrats do this to
EDL	00:00:53,248	00:00:55,296	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But today's case Gill V Whitford
EDL	00:00:55,296	00:00:56,320	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Is about a Republican
EDL	00:00:56,832	00:01:00,672	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	A map in Wisconsin where for example in 2012
EDL	00:01:00,672	00:01:03,232	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Democrats got 53% of the vote
EDL	00:01:03,232	00:01:05,024	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But only 39% of the
EDL	00:01:05,792	00:01:07,584	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Republican made that happen
EDL	00:01:07,584	00:01:09,120	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Buy packing Democrats
EDL	00:01:09,120	00:01:11,168	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Into Super Democratic districts
EDL	00:01:11,168	00:01:13,472	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Weather Boats were essentially wasted
EDL	00:01:13,472	00:01:14,752	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And also by
EDL	00:01:14,752	00:01:16,032	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Kraken Democrats
EDL	00:01:16,032	00:01:18,080	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Into mostly Republican districts
EDL	00:01:18,592	00:01:19,872	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Weather boats
EDL	00:01:19,872	00:01:21,152	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	We're essentially wasted
EDL	00:01:21,664	00:01:25,248	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	In a move that could have a huge bearing on the future of American politics this
EDL	00:01:25,248	00:01:27,808	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take off Annex
EDL	00:01:27,808	00:01:28,832	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Explosive cake
EDL	00:01:28,832	00:01:35,232	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Whether lawmakers in Wisconsin's republican-led legislature went too far in 2011 when they read through the snow
EDL	00:01:35,232	00:01:38,816	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	State electoral map to make it harder for Democrats to win legislative races
EDL	00:01:39,584	00:01:44,192	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I will make the Supreme Court case all the bigger a big deal right now
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:44,960	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Is
EDL	00:01:44,960	00:01:45,472	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The timer
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:49,312	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	This is the first time in more than a decade
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:51,104	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But it's going to take up the question of drawing lines
EDL	00:01:51,104	00:01:51,616	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Partisan game
EDL	00:01:52,128	00:01:56,224	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And this is Justin Levitt he teaches bought at Loyola in Los Angeles
EDL	00:01:56,224	00:01:59,296	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It's going to do that right on the eve of
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:01,344	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Everybody redrawing lines everywhere
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:04,672	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Local District State District's congressional districts
EDL	00:02:05,440	00:02:11,840	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	After the census in 2020 all sorts of different bodies will redraw all sorts of different lines and this case
EDL	00:02:11,840	00:02:13,120	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Will help decide
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:13,632	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	How and where
EDL	00:02:14,144	00:02:17,472	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And if the court can crack this nut it'll be solving one of the biggest
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:18,496	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Baddest
EDL	00:02:18,496	00:02:21,056	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And oldest abuses of power
EDL	00:02:21,056	00:02:22,336	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	In our democracy
EDL	00:02:22,336	00:02:24,896	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It goes back to before there was an America
EDL	00:02:24,896	00:02:28,480	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So there were problems with rotten boroughs in England
EDL	00:02:28,480	00:02:31,040	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I wish were Century districts with no people in them
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:33,088	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The nevertheless elected representatives
EDL	00:02:33,088	00:02:34,880	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	In this country in America
EDL	00:02:35,392	00:02:38,208	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The allegations going these fees are also contested all the way back
EDL	00:02:38,976	00:02:43,072	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The allegations are that Patrick Henry tried to gerrymander James Mattis
EDL	00:02:43,072	00:02:43,840	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Out of
EDL	00:02:44,352	00:02:45,376	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The very first Congress
EDL	00:02:45,888	00:02:46,912	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Hemp seeds in Virginia
EDL	00:02:47,424	00:02:48,704	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Because he was so upset with
EDL	00:02:49,216	00:02:50,240	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The Constitution
EDL	00:02:50,240	00:02:51,264	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The word itself
EDL	00:02:52,032	00:02:54,848	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Comes from in 1812 attempt
EDL	00:02:55,360	00:02:55,872	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	2
EDL	00:02:56,640	00:02:58,176	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Change the lines in Massachusetts
EDL	00:02:58,688	00:03:00,736	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It is named after a governor mess
EDL	00:03:00,736	00:03:02,016	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Elbridge Gerry
EDL	00:03:02,528	00:03:03,808	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I meant if you go to
EDL	00:03:03,808	00:03:08,416	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Northeastern Massachusetts they will tell you passionately that is called the gerrymandering out of Jerry Mannix
EDL	00:03:09,440	00:03:12,512	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	That's something that people actually argue about it over Massachusetts
EDL	00:03:13,280	00:03:17,120	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	To the allegations were that did Elbridge Gerry created a district that snake
EDL	00:03:17,120	00:03:20,448	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Around the northern cape and suburbs essentially
EDL	00:03:20,448	00:03:25,312	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I it was ridiculed in a political cartoon of time is looking more like a salamander than a district
EDL	00:03:25,824	00:03:27,616	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And the portmanteau is born
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,128	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I gerrymander
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:31,968	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And since that moment we've been living with this unfortunate word
EDL	00:03:31,968	00:03:33,760	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And it's unfortunate problem
EDL	00:03:33,760	00:03:37,088	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And it turns out it's a really hard problem to solve
EDL	00:03:37,600	00:03:39,136	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Leavitt says you can't just
EDL	00:03:39,136	00:03:40,160	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Hit reset
EDL	00:03:40,160	00:03:41,952	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Draw some rectangles and call it a day
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:43,488	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	That's not the way people live
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:50,400	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Nobody is ever bought a house because it fit the last perfect spot on the last perfect square grid and last perfect develop
EDL	00:03:51,168	00:03:53,728	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	In a square City in a square County in a square state
EDL	00:03:55,264	00:03:58,592	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The way we live is sloppy and messy
EDL	00:03:58,592	00:03:59,360	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And organic
EDL	00:04:00,128	00:04:05,248	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	See that I find an interesting cuz one of the one of the conversation people have about districts a lot of times it's like
EDL	00:04:05,760	00:04:11,648	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Look at this District
EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:13,952	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The truth is like if you look at it like
EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:14,720	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Voting rights.
EDL	00:04:15,488	00:04:17,024	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	He'll do that to try and keep
EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,559	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Exactly since together
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:19,327	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Right
EDL	00:04:19,327	00:04:22,143	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Totally I think the best example to look at here is
EDL	00:04:22,655	00:04:24,703	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Illinois's 4th Congressional
EDL	00:04:24,703	00:04:28,543	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It looks like this weird jaw the skeletal job trying to eat like
EDL	00:04:29,055	00:04:29,823	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Lake Michigan
EDL	00:04:29,823	00:04:31,871	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	People actually called the ear
EDL	00:04:31,871	00:04:33,151	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Ida chemist because
EDL	00:04:33,919	00:04:34,943	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Horizontal so
EDL	00:04:34,943	00:04:37,503	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	If you put it that way we look like you're much too big trunk
EDL	00:04:38,015	00:04:39,295	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Connected by basically this
EDL	00:04:39,295	00:04:40,063	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Straightener
EDL	00:04:40,063	00:04:42,367	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Looks really tacky it's running up a highway
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:43,135	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But
EDL	00:04:43,135	00:04:44,671	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	This was drawn by democrats
EDL	00:04:45,183	00:04:45,951	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So United
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:46,975	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	2
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:48,511	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Similar
EDL	00:04:48,511	00:04:50,303	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But geographically you know
EDL	00:04:50,303	00:04:51,071	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Apart
EDL	00:04:51,071	00:04:52,607	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Latino District right
EDL	00:04:52,607	00:04:54,399	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	How to create a cohesive
EDL	00:04:54,399	00:04:54,911	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Block
EDL	00:04:55,679	00:04:58,239	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And it's actually if you look at it that way
EDL	00:04:58,239	00:04:59,007	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It's a very
EDL	00:04:59,007	00:04:59,775	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Good
EDL	00:04:59,775	00:05:00,543	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Helpful
EDL	00:05:00,543	00:05:02,847	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	This is it gives a community voice
EDL	00:05:02,847	00:05:04,639	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Right so in the end the question is
EDL	00:05:04,639	00:05:05,151	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	How do you
EDL	00:05:05,663	00:05:07,967	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Distinguish between what's giving a community of voice
EDL	00:05:08,479	00:05:08,991	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And what's
EDL	00:05:09,503	00:05:10,271	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Straight up
EDL	00:05:10,271	00:05:11,295	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Scandalous
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:12,063	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Cheating
EDL	00:05:12,063	00:05:16,927	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It all starts with designing districts around real communities that have something in common with each other
EDL	00:05:18,463	00:05:20,511	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It turns out that's really hard to
EDL	00:05:20,511	00:05:21,023	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Do
EDL	00:05:21,535	00:05:23,071	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	When your legislator
EDL	00:05:24,095	00:05:26,911	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Focused intently on the next election
EDL	00:05:27,423	00:05:29,727	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And that's my time and time again
EDL	00:05:29,727	00:05:34,079	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Gerrymandering has ended up in front of the Supreme Court's of the United States
EDL	00:05:34,591	00:05:37,151	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The nine justices in DC have to do what
EDL	00:05:37,663	00:05:39,199	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Congress doesn't really care to
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:42,527	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The Constitution does not require the
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:43,039	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Cigar
EDL	00:05:43,551	00:05:46,367	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	This is Justice Stevens back in 2004
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,647	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Partisan gerrymandering
EDL	00:05:48,159	00:05:49,695	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	English
EDL	00:05:50,207	00:05:53,023	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Enables representatives to choose
EDL	00:05:56,863	00:05:57,887	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Undemocratic

EDL	00:05:59,423	00:05:59,935	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Malpractice
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:04,287	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The case was beef vs Jubilee as the last time the Supreme Court
EDL	00:06:04,287	00:06:06,079	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Dealt with partisan gerrymandering
EDL	00:06:06,079	00:06:08,383	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And just as Kennedy in the first
EDL	00:06:08,383	00:06:09,151	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The Jubilee year
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:09,919	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Basically said
EDL	00:06:10,431	00:06:13,759	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You legal community of America need to solve this for us
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,551	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Or we are in big trouble
EDL	00:06:16,575	00:06:20,415	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Weekly Standard
EDL	00:06:21,951	00:06:24,255	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Now we have in our own Jersey
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:27,583	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Geographical
EDL	00:06:27,583	00:06:28,095	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Compactness
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:30,399	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But I just don't think we have
EDL	00:06:32,703	00:06:33,471	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Numbers
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:35,775	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	One person one vote
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:39,615	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But beyond that
EDL	00:06:40,127	00:06:43,967	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And the Justice of the deathly looked at Sea trying to fix this invite versus juvelier
EDL	00:06:44,479	00:06:46,527	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	These are people who love rules they love test
EDL	00:06:47,039	00:06:50,111	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So they came up with a whole bunch and no one could agree on any of them
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:54,207	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	They're looking at the big Statewide picture versus the local little
EDL	00:06:54,207	00:06:54,975	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Sure they were
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:59,583	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Using racial standards from the Voting Rights Act and not it was like a hot mess
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:00,607	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Of socialist
EDL	00:07:01,375	00:07:02,911	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And Kennedy could see this
EDL	00:07:02,911	00:07:04,191	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And what he said is
EDL	00:07:04,959	00:07:05,983	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Sitting in the middle
EDL	00:07:05,983	00:07:07,007	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	As he often is
EDL	00:07:07,519	00:07:09,823	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The most powerful man in the country by many stretches
EDL	00:07:10,591	00:07:11,359	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The courts
EDL	00:07:11,359	00:07:13,151	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Should be in this business
EDL	00:07:13,151	00:07:13,663	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Yes
EDL	00:07:14,943	00:07:18,271	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But I haven't heard a standard that lets us decide how much is
EDL	00:07:18,271	00:07:18,783	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Is too much yet
EDL	00:07:19,551	00:07:20,063	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So give me some
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:23,391	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It was as public a plea to
EDL	00:07:23,391	00:07:23,903	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Lawyers
EDL	00:07:24,415	00:07:27,743	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	To bring cases to help him work through the appropriate test
EDL	00:07:28,255	00:07:29,279	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	As I think anybody's ever
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,815	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I'm sort of like this
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,583	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Public
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:32,095	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Challenge
EDL	00:07:32,607	00:07:33,887	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Who out there can solve this
EDL	00:07:34,655	00:07:35,935	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And and now
EDL	00:07:36,703	00:07:38,495	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	May finally have a solution
EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:42,335	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Allow me to introduce the efficiency Gap
EDL	00:07:42,335	00:07:48,479	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The efficiency Gap efficiency Gap is essentially this
EDL	00:07:48,991	00:07:53,343	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Relatively simple math equation for measuring Parts in jail
EDL	00:07:53,343	00:07:58,975	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The idea is if the justices want to know was its districts fairly drawn
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:00,767	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Or are some legislators up to no good
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:05,119	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	All we have to do is grab a calculator plug in a few numbers and Ben
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:05,631	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	They get there
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,191	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	To political scientist came up with it
EDL	00:08:08,703	00:08:11,007	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And then a bunch of mathematicians weighed in on it
EDL	00:08:11,519	00:08:14,079	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And one of them was Professor Moon duchin
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:18,175	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You can call me moon or Professor teaching she works for Tufts University in Boston
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:20,479	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I do geometry topology
EDL	00:08:20,479	00:08:23,807	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Group Theory and Dynamics so little bit of everything across the mask
EDL	00:08:24,319	00:08:26,111	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Just as a heads up with all is dust
EDL	00:08:26,111	00:08:27,903	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Acknowledge the existence of a maths
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:33,023	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Moon co-authored a paper titled a formula goes to court which is essentially What's Happening Here
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:34,815	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Supreme Court's going to consider
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:37,631	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Weather this efficiency Gap formula passes muster
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,679	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Is this equation a
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:40,959	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Reasonable standard
EDL	00:08:41,471	00:08:43,007	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	From measuring partisan German
EDL	00:08:44,543	00:08:50,687	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The efficiency Gap formula does that in a couple of different ways most importantly by measuring what
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:51,967	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Called wasted vote
EDL	00:08:52,735	00:08:54,271	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And wheezing votes by definition
EDL	00:08:54,783	00:08:55,807	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	They are
EDL	00:08:55,807	00:08:57,343	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The number of votes that you got
EDL	00:08:57,855	00:08:59,391	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Minus 50%
EDL	00:08:59,391	00:09:00,159	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	If you want
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,975	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	In other words there's a voice that you wasted while winning
EDL	00:09:02,975	00:09:06,047	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So if Republicans got 60% in a district
EDL	00:09:06,047	00:09:07,839	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Wastage would be tempered
EDL	00:09:07,839	00:09:11,423	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Okay okay so if I got 10 volts but only in five I wasted
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:12,447	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:13,727	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Or
EDL	00:09:13,727	00:09:15,263	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	They're all the votes if you lost
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:18,847	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So in that same district the Democrats got 40%
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:23,199	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And so that was 40% wasted because I didn't go towards electing a Democrat
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:26,783	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Okay so wasted for the losing side is basically
EDL	00:09:26,783	00:09:27,551	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	All of the votes
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,599	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	In a race where you lost
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:30,879	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Yeah that's a waste
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,183	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And then the efficiency Gap
EDL	00:09:33,183	00:09:34,207	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Is quite simply
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:34,975	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You take
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:36,767	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	All the ways to vote for a
EDL	00:09:36,767	00:09:37,791	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Across the entire state
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:41,375	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	All the wasted votes for b u takes a difference
EDL	00:09:41,375	00:09:42,911	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	As a proportion of the total turnout
EDL	00:09:43,423	00:09:45,471	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Efficiency
EDL	00:09:45,471	00:09:46,751	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Subtraction
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:51,359	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It's party a wasted votes - party B's wasted votes
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:52,383	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Divided
EDL	00:09:52,383	00:09:54,431	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	By the total number of people who voted
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:57,247	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	That gives you a number that measures
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,015	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Gerrymandering
EDL	00:09:58,015	00:10:00,319	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It's is addition and subtraction
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,879	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	With a smattering of division it is so not scary
EDL	00:10:03,391	00:10:07,231	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So Republican wasted vote - Democrat wasted votes
EDL	00:10:08,511	00:10:09,535	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	/ the
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,559	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Total number of
EDL	00:10:10,559	00:10:11,583	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Of overall volume
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:14,911	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	That's that's the that's what we're trying to measure
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:15,679	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Here yeah
EDL	00:10:15,679	00:10:18,495	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Why would that work as a measuring of gerrymandering
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:19,519	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So
EDL	00:10:19,519	00:10:25,919	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Take a look a purple State like Wisconsin where you know you have Democrats winning and you have Republicans winning and they're both wasting
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:26,687	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Boats
EDL	00:10:26,687	00:10:29,503	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	They're both winning elections losing elections and
EDL	00:10:29,503	00:10:31,295	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And every one of those races
EDL	00:10:31,807	00:10:35,647	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	They're wasting both because I wasted vote as anything over 50
EDL	00:10:35,647	00:10:37,951	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	If you want 80%
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,719	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And
EDL	00:10:38,719	00:10:42,815	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Anything you lost if you lost right so wasted Just Happening across the board
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:46,399	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But theoretically it's happening on both side so all the wasted should
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,959	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Do canceling out in Wisconsin have this picture where
EDL	00:10:48,959	00:10:51,263	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Democrats won 53% of the vote
EDL	00:10:51,775	00:10:54,079	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But only one 39% of the sea
EDL	00:10:55,103	00:10:57,151	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It's a Democrat for wasting a lot more the Republic
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:10:57,919	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Tons more
EDL	00:10:57,919	00:10:59,199	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And that might mean
EDL	00:10:59,199	00:10:59,967	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	That they're sort of this
EDL	00:11:00,991	00:11:01,759	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Pattern
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:02,783	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Of wasted votes
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:03,807	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Across the entire state
EDL	00:11:04,319	00:11:06,367	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The entire map might have been drawn
EDL	00:11:06,367	00:11:07,135	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	To favor one side
EDL	00:11:07,647	00:11:13,791	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Is that like if you plug in the numbers in the equation you if you got a big number that means lots of ways to get a little number that means
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,583	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	0 is that is that essentially it or is it
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,351	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Something like that
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:17,375	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Really yeah
EDL	00:11:19,423	00:11:20,191	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	That's cool
EDL	00:11:20,703	00:11:21,727	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It literally is like
EDL	00:11:25,567	00:11:26,847	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Is it like that
EDL	00:11:26,847	00:11:29,407	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	There's actually a way that we don't need that
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:32,479	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Moon's got even easier way
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,503	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	To understand this
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:35,551	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	A shortcut
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:37,343	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I can tell you what it is
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,623	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Do you want notice right now
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:39,903	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	No effort
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:06,527	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	This is my perfect I'm Jared I'm right here with Shaun Robbins firm we're talking about the ancient problem of gerrymandering
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:10,367	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	A solution may be about to fly into the
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:12,159	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The Supreme Court on the gleaming wings
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:12,927	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Matt
EDL	00:12:12,927	00:12:14,719	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You mentioned that there was a there's a short
EDL	00:12:14,719	00:12:18,815	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Truck yeah you know if you don't like the math that we were doing a little deficient scab
EDL	00:12:18,815	00:12:21,119	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Professor duchin gave me this
EDL	00:12:21,119	00:12:22,911	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Disorder handiwork around
EDL	00:12:22,911	00:12:26,751	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	That'll probably make it a lot easier to understand the whole wasted vote
EDL	00:12:27,263	00:12:30,335	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It just involves comparing how many votes you got in the race
EDL	00:12:30,335	00:12:32,895	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	How many seats you got in that same race
EDL	00:12:32,895	00:12:34,175	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	All you have to do
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,455	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Is Teak
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,735	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Your vote margin
EDL	00:12:36,735	00:12:38,015	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And double it
EDL	00:12:38,015	00:12:40,319	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Efficiency Gap tells you that should be your seat March
EDL	00:12:40,831	00:12:43,903	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So you got 53% of the votes
EDL	00:12:44,415	00:12:47,487	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So that's a margin of 3% over. Why
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:47,999	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Doublet
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:50,303	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You should get 56% of the sea
EDL	00:12:50,303	00:12:51,583	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	If you get
EDL	00:12:52,095	00:12:53,119	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Try this with me now
EDL	00:12:53,119	00:12:54,399	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You get 60% of votes
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:56,447	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So how many seats should you get
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:57,727	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Okay so
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:12:59,007	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I got 60% of
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:01,055	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I need 50% to win
EDL	00:13:01,055	00:13:03,103	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Size of track that off I got
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:04,127	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	10% left
EDL	00:13:04,895	00:13:05,919	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And doubled
EDL	00:13:05,919	00:13:06,943	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	That's 20%
EDL	00:13:07,455	00:13:10,015	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And then I add back the original 50%
EDL	00:13:10,527	00:13:11,551	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I won
EDL	00:13:11,551	00:13:12,063	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And that's
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:14,367	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	70% of the seats
EDL	00:13:14,367	00:13:14,879	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You got it
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:18,463	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The one I just went to 60% why do I double it
EDL	00:13:18,463	00:13:19,999	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So that's an excellent question
EDL	00:13:19,999	00:13:22,303	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And what's
EDL	00:13:22,303	00:13:24,863	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Because of a kind of complicated answer to that
EDL	00:13:24,863	00:13:26,143	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Interesting
EDL	00:13:26,143	00:13:28,447	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	This a well if you look at elections
EDL	00:13:28,959	00:13:32,287	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Don't believe the margin is what actually tends to happen
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:36,895	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Okay so these guys Professor duchin mean Stephanopoulos and McGee
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:38,687	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The dude who came up with the efficiency Gap
EDL	00:13:39,455	00:13:45,855	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	What they say is when you look at elections across the country and compare how many votes the winning party gets to have
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:47,135	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	How many seats the winning party gets
EDL	00:13:47,903	00:13:50,207	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The winners tend to get some extra seats
EDL	00:13:50,207	00:13:51,999	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	This idea is called the seat bonus
EDL	00:13:52,511	00:13:55,327	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The idea that if you win by a little you should get a cushion
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:13:56,863	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	In your governing majority
EDL	00:13:57,375	00:14:03,775	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So it's like what are systems kind of funky let's let's roll with it and here we baked the funk into the into the formula we baked in
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:05,823	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	In the funk I love it that should be the subtitle
EDL	00:14:06,335	00:14:08,639	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	His genius of Brandon
EDL	00:14:08,639	00:14:11,711	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Grateful they're taking something descriptive this is what actually happened
EDL	00:14:13,247	00:14:16,063	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Turning around do something normative which says this is what should
EDL	00:14:16,831	00:14:18,879	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So well let's look at
EDL	00:14:18,879	00:14:19,647	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Waupaca Wisconsin
EDL	00:14:19,647	00:14:21,439	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The courts of the gerrymandering quotes
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:23,999	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Did in fact prevent Wisconsin Democrat
EDL	00:14:23,999	00:14:25,023	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	From being able to
EDL	00:14:25,023	00:14:27,583	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Translate their vote into seat as affect
EDL	00:14:27,583	00:14:29,119	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Is Wisconsin Republican
EDL	00:14:29,631	00:14:31,423	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So Wisconsin in
EDL	00:14:31,423	00:14:32,191	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	2008
EDL	00:14:32,959	00:14:33,983	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Dems get
EDL	00:14:33,983	00:14:35,263	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	57% of the vote
EDL	00:14:36,543	00:14:37,311	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So
EDL	00:14:37,311	00:14:38,847	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	What percent of seats should they get
EDL	00:14:38,847	00:14:41,407	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	This is according to the Matthew just did you can do it
EDL	00:14:41,407	00:14:43,711	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Okay 57 650
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:46,271	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I got 7 * 2 is 14
EDL	00:14:46,271	00:14:48,063	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	+ the original 50
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:49,087	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	WhatsApp
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:54,463	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	84% of the seats you got it exactly God
EDL	00:14:54,463	00:14:54,975	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I have this
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:15:00,095	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Instead in 2008 they get 52%
EDL	00:15:00,607	00:15:02,399	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Cancel that suggests that
EDL	00:15:02,911	00:15:07,519	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	View through lines of efficiency Gap things are stacked against them by quite a bit
EDL	00:15:07,519	00:15:08,287	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Right in Seoul
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:09,567	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	That's how this works it becomes
EDL	00:15:10,079	00:15:11,871	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Only a way to compare
EDL	00:15:11,871	00:15:13,407	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You vote margin to see margin
EDL	00:15:13,919	00:15:16,991	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Not moons feeling about all this deficiency Gap the shortcut
EDL	00:15:17,759	00:15:18,527	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It's a good start
EDL	00:15:19,039	00:15:20,063	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But it's just
EDL	00:15:20,063	00:15:20,831	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The start
EDL	00:15:20,831	00:15:23,391	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You know I really respect the effort to take
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:26,719	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Something so complicated and boiled down into a single number but
EDL	00:15:26,719	00:15:28,511	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It fundamentally can't beat
EDL	00:15:28,511	00:15:30,559	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Done that simply because
EDL	00:15:31,071	00:15:33,375	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	People are way more complicated than just
EDL	00:15:33,375	00:15:34,399	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	What number we are
EDL	00:15:34,911	00:15:39,263	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	We are geography we our history our race were so many things
EDL	00:15:39,263	00:15:41,055	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You're going to need a few different
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,823	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Metrics at once
EDL	00:15:42,335	00:15:45,663	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The fear is that that's what the courts been allergic to is
EDL	00:15:45,663	00:15:49,503	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You have several different metrics how do you combine them and how do you decide when enough is enough
EDL	00:15:50,271	00:15:56,671	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	By Good Fortune we're now finally in a position with been a long time that partisan gerrymandering
EDL	00:15:56,671	00:15:57,439	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Rendering keeps peeing
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:16:00,767	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But you can keep seeing take down the road by the court
EDL	00:16:00,767	00:16:02,047	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Good news is
EDL	00:16:02,047	00:16:05,119	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	They may have some postponed and delayed just long enough
EDL	00:16:05,119	00:16:07,167	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But now we have some really good alternative
EDL	00:16:07,679	00:16:10,751	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Most promising things this coming down the pike is
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,543	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The use of computers
EDL	00:16:14,591	00:16:18,175	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Dreamed of this for decades but computing power just hasn't been
EDL	00:16:18,175	00:16:19,455	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Nearly ready
EDL	00:16:19,455	00:16:20,479	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	To contend
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:22,015	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	With the big data of
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:23,551	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The three District
EDL	00:16:23,551	00:16:24,319	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Problem
EDL	00:16:24,319	00:16:25,343	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	That's because
EDL	00:16:25,343	00:16:26,367	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	We're doing some
EDL	00:16:27,135	00:16:30,207	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Phenomenally complicated, notorious we've got
EDL	00:16:30,207	00:16:36,607	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	This, that's what matters
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,143	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Accounting
EDL	00:16:38,655	00:16:43,775	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Supreme Court isn't quite at combinatorics but if Justice Kennedy likes the efficiency Gap
EDL	00:16:43,775	00:16:46,847	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The Court's decision could dramatically change the way
EDL	00:16:46,847	00:16:47,871	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	State Street
EDL	00:16:48,895	00:16:53,247	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And if the court can Embrace this standard moons hoping it will go for others down the road
EDL	00:16:54,015	00:16:58,111	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Ones that more fully consider all the kinds of connections
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:59,903	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	That make up a community
EDL	00:16:59,903	00:17:00,415	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	They're just
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:03,999	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Phenomenally many ways to break down
EDL	00:17:03,999	00:17:05,535	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Millions of people
EDL	00:17:05,535	00:17:06,047	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Into
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:07,327	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Doesn't exist
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,143	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	If you just enumerate all the possibilities
EDL	00:17:10,143	00:17:11,935	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So that's the biggest day that you're going to find
EDL	00:17:11,935	00:17:13,727	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Bigger than medical problems bigger than
EDL	00:17:13,727	00:17:14,239	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Astronomical
EDL	00:17:15,775	00:17:19,359	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Asking a computer to really understand all the possibilities has been Out Of Reach
EDL	00:17:19,871	00:17:22,431	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	But what's happened recently is both
EDL	00:17:22,431	00:17:26,527	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Computing power and the algorithms used to study this have been getting better and better
EDL	00:17:27,807	00:17:31,135	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Forecastle understood how to constrain that search space more
EDL	00:17:32,415	00:17:34,463	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	What we're moving towards is a Time
EDL	00:17:34,463	00:17:37,791	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	I won't be able to cut down the space of possibilities that you have to search
EDL	00:17:37,791	00:17:41,375	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And at the same time computers will be getting more powerful until those meet in the middle
EDL	00:17:41,375	00:17:42,911	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	In computers can really see all about
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:46,239	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	So what numbers are
EDL	00:17:46,239	00:17:48,799	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You're too big for mathematicians to even wrap their heads around when you can
EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:51,103	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Computers oh no other way around
EDL	00:17:51,103	00:17:53,407	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Applications are very comfortable
EDL	00:17:53,407	00:17:57,759	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Infinity is the computers that have had to catch up
EDL	00:17:57,759	00:17:59,807	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Computer need to catch up
EDL	00:18:00,319	00:18:02,367	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	How do we expect 9th Supreme Court Justice
EDL	00:18:02,367	00:18:07,487	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	What happens when computers can really explore
EDL	00:18:07,487	00:18:09,023	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	The space of possibilities
EDL	00:18:09,023	00:18:10,559	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Is it they can build
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:13,375	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	A bell curve of the properties of all the different Maps
EDL	00:18:13,887	00:18:15,935	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Soap computers are going to do it for us
EDL	00:18:16,447	00:18:18,239	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Create Maps app on maps
EDL	00:18:18,239	00:18:19,775	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Zapata maps that
EDL	00:18:19,775	00:18:22,079	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Together will give us an idea of what a disc
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:22,847	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Scripture look like
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:26,687	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	And then you look at Wisconsin's actual plans legislature enacted
EDL	00:18:27,199	00:18:28,991	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	You'll see where it falls on the bell curve
EDL	00:18:29,503	00:18:31,039	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Is it in the nice meaty part in the middle
EDL	00:18:31,551	00:18:33,087	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Or is it an outlier that's
EDL	00:18:33,087	00:18:34,623	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Just out along the tail of bell curve
EDL	00:18:36,159	00:18:36,927	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Pretty
EDL	00:18:36,927	00:18:37,951	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Persuasive enough
EDL	00:18:37,951	00:18:39,743	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Kind of outlier analysis
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:43,839	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	It should be pretty comfortable for court because they do this all the time for other kinds of
EDL	00:18:44,351	00:18:45,375	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Legal standards
EDL	00:18:46,399	00:18:47,167	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	What is
EDL	00:18:47,167	00:18:48,191	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Perfect this
EDL	00:18:48,191	00:18:48,959	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	Look like
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:50,239	| moreperfect100317_gerry |	What is something that is just
