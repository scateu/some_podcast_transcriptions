EDL	00:08:16,383	00:08:22,783	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	His parents were born in Japan and then all his brothers were born here in the US born in Oakland California
EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:27,135	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He was the third out of four brothers and being the Third
EDL	00:08:27,135	00:08:28,415	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	At the 2nd to the 1st
EDL	00:08:28,927	00:08:30,975	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That mattered absolutely
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:35,839	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Fred wasn't unique position as the third son he could resist
EDL	00:08:35,839	00:08:40,959	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We asked Lorraine Vani I teach at Seattle University School of Law for some contacts
EDL	00:08:40,959	00:08:47,359	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Kiawah professor and a friend of Fred's family the cultural tradition is that the first son is the favorite son
EDL	00:08:47,359	00:08:53,759	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The oldest was going to inherit the family garden and Nursery business II would help out with that business
EDL	00:08:53,759	00:08:57,599	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Dad as a third son was very low on the totem pole
EDL	00:08:57,599	00:09:02,207	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	His parents didn't have the same expectations of him relatively speaking he was kind of the hook
EDL	00:09:03,999	00:09:09,375	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Unlike his older brothers he didn't speak much Japanese and he felt more American than anything else
EDL	00:09:09,887	00:09:15,775	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	When I was in school we start each day for the Pledge of Allegiance I studied American history
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:18,335	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I always been a good American citizen
EDL	00:09:18,335	00:09:21,151	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So when he came home that Sunday when Pearl Harbor was attacked
EDL	00:09:21,663	00:09:23,967	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Is family responsible whole thing was
EDL	00:09:24,735	00:09:25,759	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Unsettling
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:26,527	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I am
EDL	00:09:27,039	00:09:28,319	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I didn't know what to do
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,855	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And Fred says
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:30,879	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Pretty soon after
EDL	00:09:31,391	00:09:32,415	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Things got very weird
EDL	00:09:32,927	00:09:37,023	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Within a few days I put spotlights on the whole Nursery at night
EDL	00:09:37,023	00:09:39,583	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And they had a gun standing right now
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:45,983	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Our home there around the fence there watching us cuz I went out one night to have a cigarette and I was saying on the
EDL	00:09:45,983	00:09:47,519	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Parts of a cigarette
EDL	00:09:48,287	00:09:51,871	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And God Yolanda if I was singling somebody
EDL	00:09:52,895	00:09:53,919	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:09:55,199	00:09:57,503	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Then came Roosevelt executive order
EDL	00:10:00,575	00:10:02,623	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That big order 906 6
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:05,951	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Authorized the military to make a series of smaller ones
EDL	00:10:05,951	00:10:07,999	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The first set of orders was a curfew order
EDL	00:10:07,999	00:10:09,023	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Saying that
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:12,351	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Japanese Italians and Germans were subject to a curfew
EDL	00:10:12,351	00:10:17,471	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Second order was a freeze order directed just at the Japanese on the West Coast
EDL	00:10:17,471	00:10:22,591	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They weren't allowed to leave the area and then the third order wasn't ordered that they could not
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:24,383	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We met
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:25,663	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	On the West Coast
EDL	00:10:25,663	00:10:32,063	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Except for in the custody of an approved location by the army
EDL	00:10:32,063	00:10:36,671	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They're about 15 of these assembly centers
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:42,815	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Japanese-Americans were told to report to one of these centers by a certain date
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:48,191	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Fred's family began to scramble to worry about what they were going to take
EDL	00:10:48,191	00:10:54,591	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	What was going to happen to the nursery and still expecting my mother you know the attention and
EDL	00:10:54,591	00:10:57,663	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Worries so in the days before his family left
EDL	00:10:58,943	00:11:03,039	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Fred made a decision
EDL	00:11:03,551	00:11:09,951	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I am I had my own worries and I had mom girlfriend my own problems he decided not to go with his fam
EDL	00:11:09,951	00:11:10,975	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I am
EDL	00:11:10,975	00:11:12,511	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Doctor then bedtime
EDL	00:11:14,047	00:11:15,583	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That I can want to
EDL	00:11:16,607	00:11:17,631	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I won't leave with you
EDL	00:11:18,399	00:11:20,447	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You didn't want to leave item behind
EDL	00:11:20,447	00:11:23,775	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We thought maybe the two of them could make a break for it later on
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:24,543	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Leave the state
EDL	00:11:25,055	00:11:26,847	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Before the evacuation deadline
EDL	00:11:28,127	00:11:29,407	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,711	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They said fine if you can do it
EDL	00:11:32,479	00:11:33,247	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Go ahead
EDL	00:11:34,783	00:11:36,063	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He was the third son
EDL	00:11:36,575	00:11:42,975	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So he knew that his older brothers would be able to take care of the family and they said he was
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:45,279	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Was a grown-up and he should make his own decisions
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:49,887	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And so he did he went off and got his own apartment and his own job as a welder
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:52,191	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I'm kind of lived under the radar
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:58,847	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	News brothers will be there to take care of his parents if you're with the family
EDL	00:11:58,847	00:12:01,407	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Like my family or any Japanese family
EDL	00:12:02,431	00:12:05,247	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You feel the pressure in the
EDL	00:12:05,247	00:12:06,271	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Sadness
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:12,415	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But on the outside is different just like a normal
EDL	00:12:13,183	00:12:14,207	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	What if you know
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:17,023	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Just like we've been living all the time
EDL	00:12:18,559	00:12:19,839	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I felt right at home
EDL	00:12:20,607	00:12:24,191	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You know I'm an American citizen to you know
EDL	00:12:26,495	00:12:27,775	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I didn't feel guilty
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:35,455	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Cuz I don't think I did anything wrong. He was politically
EDL	00:12:35,455	00:12:36,735	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Aware at this point
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:39,807	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	If you're asking me about whether he
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:43,135	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Refuse to go as an act of political resistance
EDL	00:12:43,135	00:12:44,415	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I don't think initially
EDL	00:12:45,183	00:12:46,975	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Unconsciously he probably
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:50,815	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Knew that what was happening to Japanese-Americans was wrong
EDL	00:12:51,839	00:12:55,167	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But I don't think he had the words for that we might have today
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:13:02,335	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Is on his way home from work one day that he reads in the newspaper
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:07,199	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Paper about his parents and all the other Japanese-Americans in the area being taken away to camp
EDL	00:13:07,199	00:13:13,599	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Baby's sick to my stomach and on that I can see my parents going in you.
EDL	00:13:13,599	00:13:19,231	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	My brother's going to camp and I'm not there you know
EDL	00:13:19,231	00:13:25,631	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But that was only time that I felt kind of
EDL	00:13:25,631	00:13:31,775	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Lonely you know like what what am I going to do now you know
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:36,127	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It begins to slowly down on him what he's done
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:40,479	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	By staying in the Bay Area he is officially breaking the law
EDL	00:13:41,247	00:13:45,599	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And he and Ida aren't sure what that means like will they be thrown in jail or worse
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:48,415	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He talks in the archives about how he's worried
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,207	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And I was worried to
EDL	00:13:50,719	00:13:53,023	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Because now he could get arrested
EDL	00:13:53,535	00:13:55,327	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So they start to think about their options
EDL	00:13:55,327	00:14:00,703	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Fred decides to get an ID with a Spanish sounding last name on it so we won't be recognized as Japanese
EDL	00:14:01,215	00:14:02,239	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And then
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,031	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Ida says essentially
EDL	00:14:04,031	00:14:05,311	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That might not be enough
EDL	00:14:05,311	00:14:08,895	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	She pulled out an article regarding plastic surgery
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:11,455	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And
EDL	00:14:11,455	00:14:12,991	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	What do you think of this
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:16,063	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I looked it over
EDL	00:14:16,063	00:14:17,087	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And well
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:18,623	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I didn't
EDL	00:14:18,623	00:14:22,975	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I think it was a good idea but she said hey why don't you think about
EDL	00:14:22,975	00:14:27,327	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That's this might be a good thing that will allow you to stay here
EDL	00:14:28,351	00:14:30,399	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So the idea would be that he
EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:33,215	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You don't have his eyes doubled or something like that
EDL	00:14:33,215	00:14:37,055	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	A plastic surgery procedure where you put a fold in the eyelid
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:40,383	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So you look more white less Japanese-American
EDL	00:14:40,383	00:14:41,919	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Did you think I work
EDL	00:14:42,943	00:14:44,735	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And that's I don't know
EDL	00:14:48,063	00:14:48,575	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Well
EDL	00:14:49,087	00:14:50,879	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	She said she'll be looking to it
EDL	00:14:52,159	00:14:53,183	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:15:00,351	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Why is it that I'm going to lose so we decide to try it
EDL	00:15:00,351	00:15:05,727	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So Fred gets into his car and he drives into the city into San Francisco and he
EDL	00:15:07,007	00:15:09,055	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Just stops in front of the doctor's office
EDL	00:15:12,383	00:15:13,663	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Amsart spacing
EDL	00:15:14,687	00:15:17,759	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Walking up the steps of this Victorian and then
EDL	00:15:18,527	00:15:22,367	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Walking down the steps to leave and he was a really crummy idea and then
EDL	00:15:22,367	00:15:23,647	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Walking back up the steps
EDL	00:15:24,671	00:15:28,511	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Thinking well yeah maybe I just right it's a good idea and the down the steps
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,327	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	This is a ridiculous idea
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:35,167	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Giving some doctor your hard-earned money to
EDL	00:15:35,167	00:15:37,727	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Change your face
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:38,751	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So it goes up
EDL	00:15:38,751	00:15:40,031	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And down
EDL	00:15:40,031	00:15:40,799	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And I
EDL	00:15:41,311	00:15:43,103	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Turn down a notch
EDL	00:15:43,103	00:15:44,895	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I'm down until
EDL	00:15:46,431	00:15:47,455	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He decided to just
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:48,479	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Going
EDL	00:15:49,503	00:15:50,783	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Have a procedure done
EDL	00:15:51,551	00:15:53,343	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He really did it as a way to
EDL	00:15:53,343	00:15:55,903	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Protect them as they try to leave the state
EDL	00:15:57,183	00:16:02,815	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The doctor said he was going to work on his eyes and then also fix a broken nose I had a broken nose
EDL	00:16:02,815	00:16:04,863	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I'm playing football and I never had it fixed
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,655	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:08,959	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So you could do a pretty good work on me
EDL	00:16:09,983	00:16:12,799	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But it turned out he didn't do everything he said he would
EDL	00:16:12,799	00:16:13,823	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Regis
EDL	00:16:13,823	00:16:15,871	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Took my money that's what it was I join
EDL	00:16:16,639	00:16:18,687	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	There wasn't anything change except
EDL	00:16:18,687	00:16:21,247	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I didn't have a broken nose anymore
EDL	00:16:23,807	00:16:27,391	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So he drives back to the East Bay with a new nose but the same eyes
EDL	00:16:27,903	00:16:32,511	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And shortly after that day at the doctor's office he's out buying cigarettes at a convenience store
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:34,559	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Leclerc
EDL	00:16:36,607	00:16:38,399	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Recognized him and reported him
EDL	00:16:38,911	00:16:43,263	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And one day walking down the street he was stopped
EDL	00:16:43,263	00:16:44,287	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And arrested
EDL	00:16:46,591	00:16:47,359	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And
EDL	00:16:47,359	00:16:52,735	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Spent his Memorial Day and 1942 in the San Leandro jail
EDL	00:16:54,271	00:16:55,295	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	When we got caught
EDL	00:16:56,063	00:16:57,599	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They called her into
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:16:58,623	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Yeah
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:00,159	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And
EDL	00:17:03,487	00:17:04,767	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I see the police chief
EDL	00:17:05,279	00:17:06,815	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Talking to her for quite a while
EDL	00:17:09,375	00:17:15,519	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I imagine it's a small jail and he's just been admitted so he's sitting in the lobby and he sees I to come into the front.
EDL	00:17:17,055	00:17:21,663	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He's just out of earshot he can't make out exactly what they're saying but at a certain point
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:22,943	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	A stop talking
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:25,247	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And she just walks out
EDL	00:17:25,759	00:17:26,527	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,807	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That was the end of it
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:30,879	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I never did see her again
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:45,983	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They never saw each other
EDL	00:17:49,823	00:17:56,223	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So you sitting there alone in the sea
EDL	00:17:56,223	00:18:02,111	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	San Leandro jail and they end up transferring him to Oakland jail for some reason and then he ends up at
EDL	00:18:02,111	00:18:06,975	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The federal prison in San Francisco because resisting the order with a federal offense
EDL	00:18:06,975	00:18:08,255	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Anyway
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:13,631	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	One day I got a call from the guard
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:20,543	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And told me I had a visitor and I didn't know it was you know
EDL	00:18:20,543	00:18:26,943	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I knew all my friends were in can't or they were in the military but Fred Goes Down to the visiting room anyway
EDL	00:18:26,943	00:18:31,551	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And there's assman there
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:35,135	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Well I believe in civil liberties
EDL	00:18:35,135	00:18:38,207	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Right of people is being denied
EDL	00:18:38,719	00:18:44,863	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	This is something that I'm concerned about the man says his name is Ernest besic and then it was over
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:47,423	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Easier to talk to me
EDL	00:18:48,703	00:18:51,775	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He asked if I need some cigarettes or something like that you know
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:56,895	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Just to break the ice by the way I asked him
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:59,199	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Who do you represent
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,991	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And Earnest response well
EDL	00:19:02,015	00:19:08,415	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	ACLU or something like that
EDL	00:19:08,415	00:19:14,559	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We have no way of knowing what exactly was said between Fred and Ernest besig
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,607	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Both men have passed away
EDL	00:19:17,119	00:19:21,471	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But it seems like something important must have happened in this conversation because
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:25,311	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	If I was Lori Benitez I don't think he had the words
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:27,871	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Or that we might have today Fred
EDL	00:19:27,871	00:19:28,639	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Didn't have
EDL	00:19:29,151	00:19:31,967	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Language of resistance before this moment
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:35,807	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Something in that conversation must have given it to him
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:38,623	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Because when Earnest Pathak asked him
EDL	00:19:38,623	00:19:41,695	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Do you want me to represent you in a court of law
EDL	00:19:42,207	00:19:43,487	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Fred says yes
EDL	00:19:46,303	00:19:48,095	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	What do you imagine the words were that
EDL	00:19:49,375	00:19:50,911	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Might have turned him in that moment
EDL	00:19:52,447	00:19:53,471	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Imagine
EDL	00:19:53,983	00:19:54,751	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:56,543	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Method must have said to fraud
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:00,383	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We think that what's happened to Japanese Americans
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,687	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Is unconstitutional
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:04,223	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We'd like to bring a lawsuit
EDL	00:20:04,223	00:20:06,271	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	To say the Japanese Americans
EDL	00:20:06,271	00:20:08,063	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Are being sent away
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:09,343	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Only because of their race
EDL	00:20:10,367	00:20:11,135	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And in that
EDL	00:20:13,695	00:20:14,719	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	J-fred language
EDL	00:20:15,999	00:20:22,143	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	For what I think Fred knew was wrong
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:41,599	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Basic try to get Fred out of jail but the military stepped in and said he had
EDL	00:20:41,599	00:20:43,135	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	How to join his family and camp
EDL	00:20:43,903	00:20:46,975	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They were at a place called Tanforan race tracks
EDL	00:20:47,743	00:20:49,791	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It was a temporary holding spot
EDL	00:20:50,303	00:20:54,655	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So that meant that the first place that Fred went after jail was
EDL	00:20:55,679	00:21:02,079	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	A converted horse stall
EDL	00:21:02,079	00:21:04,895	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The wind just blew in there no that's blue in there and everything
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:08,735	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	This was a small horse stall because Fred had asked for his own
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:14,367	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Wanted to sit and think about what to say to his family to were also at Tanforan
EDL	00:21:14,367	00:21:20,768	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Sat and looked at the single lone bear light bulb above and the smell of manure
EDL	00:21:20,768	00:21:24,608	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Hey I mean it's ready for horses not for human beings
EDL	00:21:30,752	00:21:33,056	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And then all sudden I hear a knock on the door
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:37,664	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And I'll open it with my brother is hey you can't stay here
EDL	00:21:38,176	00:21:38,944	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You got coming
EDL	00:21:39,456	00:21:40,224	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Cedar Park
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:49,440	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We walk spread over to the Star Wars families been living
EDL	00:21:50,976	00:21:54,816	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And I was surprised the way they fixed up their stalls
EDL	00:21:55,584	00:21:56,608	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They
EDL	00:21:56,608	00:21:58,656	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Solar Paula cracks
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:03,776	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And they put newspaper for the walls in the paper that all up
EDL	00:22:05,056	00:22:07,360	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	This was a common thing for these families
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:12,736	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Thousands of them were transferred to more permanent camps and many stay there for up to 3 years
EDL	00:22:12,736	00:22:14,784	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Overtime
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:17,088	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The community
EDL	00:22:17,088	00:22:19,648	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Kind of tried to build lives for themselves
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,208	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You hear stories
EDL	00:22:22,208	00:22:23,232	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	MC pictures
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:27,072	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	People building small Japanese gardens
EDL	00:22:28,864	00:22:30,400	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	What they found in the area
EDL	00:22:30,912	00:22:35,264	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	She saw newsreels about the people who made the Desert Bloom
EDL	00:22:36,544	00:22:42,176	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Eventually saw people
EDL	00:22:42,176	00:22:44,480	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Farming you know baseball teams
EDL	00:23:10,336	00:23:14,688	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	My brother he was involved in various Japanese activities
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,992	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And
EDL	00:23:17,760	00:23:20,576	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He thought it might be a good idea for me to
EDL	00:23:21,600	00:23:25,696	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Get some suggestions and opinions regarding to
EDL	00:23:27,488	00:23:29,024	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	If I should fight the case or not
EDL	00:23:31,584	00:23:33,632	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So Phresh brother calls a meeting
EDL	00:23:34,400	00:23:36,704	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You got about 30 young people together
EDL	00:23:36,704	00:23:39,264	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Imagine it was f****** a mess hall or something like that
EDL	00:23:39,776	00:23:41,824	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They discussed Frets case
EDL	00:23:41,824	00:23:42,848	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They were
EDL	00:23:42,848	00:23:45,920	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Discussion is to themselves or in little groups
EDL	00:23:46,944	00:23:51,296	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And I stood around and waited for someone to speak
EDL	00:23:54,368	00:23:56,928	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But no one actually came out to speak to me
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:14,592	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I can see Fred kind of standing in a corner as people are gathered in small groups
EDL	00:24:15,360	00:24:16,896	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Whispering to each other
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:19,712	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Stealing glances at him
EDL	00:24:27,392	00:24:33,792	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But no one says
EDL	00:24:33,792	00:24:36,864	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The word to him
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:44,032	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Finally one dead and you said Fred were undecided on
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:45,056	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	If I should find
EDL	00:24:45,056	00:24:46,336	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Acacia not because
EDL	00:24:46,848	00:24:48,384	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They don't want to
EDL	00:24:49,408	00:24:51,456	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Make any more disturbance
EDL	00:24:52,480	00:24:54,784	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Anything to upset
EDL	00:24:54,784	00:24:57,600	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The parents right at the time because they were
EDL	00:24:57,600	00:25:00,672	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	To upset already and think just being in Camp
EDL	00:25:01,440	00:25:03,488	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I told them their parents have been through enough
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:05,024	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Leaving their lives behind
EDL	00:25:06,816	00:25:08,096	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Basically they said
EDL	00:25:08,096	00:25:09,120	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We can't help you
EDL	00:25:15,264	00:25:20,128	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But there was one Japanese American group that did decide to say something about Fred's case
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,176	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	What's the name of the group
EDL	00:25:22,176	00:25:22,944	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Jas
EDL	00:25:22,944	00:25:23,712	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	CL
EDL	00:25:24,736	00:25:27,296	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Ernest message had a nickname for this group
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,344	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The Japanese-American Citizens League
EDL	00:25:29,344	00:25:30,624	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The jackals
EDL	00:25:31,392	00:25:31,904	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I meant
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:35,232	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	With a leadership of that group
EDL	00:25:35,232	00:25:36,512	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Several of them
EDL	00:25:36,512	00:25:37,536	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I purged them
EDL	00:25:38,048	00:25:39,584	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	To oppose
EDL	00:25:39,584	00:25:40,608	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The explosion
EDL	00:25:41,632	00:25:44,704	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But they didn't seem to be particularly interested
EDL	00:25:45,216	00:25:47,776	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The JCL condemned Frets case
EDL	00:25:47,776	00:25:50,336	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And anyone else who fought against the government orders
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:54,688	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Said it would not support any of these individuals were fighting the orders
EDL	00:25:54,688	00:25:56,224	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And called them
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:57,248	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Self-styled martyrs
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:59,552	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Wow that use that phrase
EDL	00:25:59,552	00:26:00,064	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Yes
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:03,648	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They would basically get everyone else into trouble
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:07,232	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	To do this by myself
EDL	00:26:07,232	00:26:09,280	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I just wonder if I was doing wrong or
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:12,352	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I'll maybe putting them in Shame by
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:14,144	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I'm bringing the issue up again
EDL	00:26:16,448	00:26:22,592	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Because of Japanese people lay their peaceful people when they they like to leave things alone if they can
EDL	00:26:23,616	00:26:27,968	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Because they were in enough trouble as it is because of this Pearl Harbor attack
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:30,784	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And the country blame them
EDL	00:26:30,784	00:26:33,600	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So they have the sort of a guilty complex
EDL	00:26:34,880	00:26:36,160	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Even though
EDL	00:26:36,160	00:26:37,696	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They have nothing to do with it
EDL	00:26:41,536	00:26:45,632	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Majority I'm just avoided me so therefore I assume that
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:52,032	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That
EDL	00:26:53,312	00:26:55,104	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I got myself in this problem
EDL	00:26:56,128	00:26:56,896	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:27:01,248	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That was my problem in the end not theirs
EDL	00:27:04,064	00:27:10,464	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Fred continue to fight his case he argued that basically rounding up
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:16,864	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Thousands of Japanese-Americans American citizens without a trial without due process
EDL	00:27:16,864	00:27:21,472	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Basically amounted to racial discrimination
EDL	00:27:21,472	00:27:27,872	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Is case made its way up and down the courts and eventually two and a half years
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:29,920	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	After he met unexpected in that jail cell
EDL	00:27:30,944	00:27:31,968	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The case arrives
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,760	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	At the Supreme Court
EDL	00:27:34,528	00:27:38,112	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Yo he thought that by the time his case got to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:27:38,112	00:27:40,160	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That's Fred's daughter Karen again he would
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:44,256	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Be able to vindicate his family and everyone that had been incarcerated
EDL	00:27:44,768	00:27:46,816	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And that's how much he believed in the Supreme Court
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:51,936	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And so when that didn't happen he felt like
EDL	00:27:53,216	00:27:55,008	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	If he felt like it was his fault
EDL	00:27:57,056	00:27:58,592	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It's a big bird to carry around
EDL	00:28:01,408	00:28:02,688	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	What ends up happening is
EDL	00:28:03,200	00:28:05,760	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	On December 18th 1944
EDL	00:28:05,760	00:28:07,040	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The Supreme Court
EDL	00:28:07,040	00:28:08,320	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Rules against Fred
EDL	00:28:09,088	00:28:10,112	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It's kind of a
EDL	00:28:10,112	00:28:11,392	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Complicated decision
EDL	00:28:11,904	00:28:13,184	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The Supreme Court said
EDL	00:28:13,696	00:28:15,232	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Racial distinctions
EDL	00:28:15,232	00:28:17,280	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	When the government is making racial
EDL	00:28:17,280	00:28:18,816	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Addiction is serious
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:20,864	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We need to look at this very very carefully
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:23,424	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And that was a big president
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:24,960	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Sun a lot of ways
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:25,472	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It's
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:26,752	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Kind of
EDL	00:28:27,264	00:28:29,824	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Victory for people fighting racial discrimination
EDL	00:28:30,592	00:28:32,384	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But then the court turned around and said
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:35,968	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Even though racial distinctions are serious
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:37,248	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	This one
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:38,528	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Is not
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:40,320	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Strictly racial
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:43,904	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We are at war with the Japanese empire there for
EDL	00:28:43,904	00:28:46,208	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Rounding up Japanese-American Citizens
EDL	00:28:46,720	00:28:48,256	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Is a way to
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:49,280	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Defend the nation
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:54,400	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Kind of your friend at this point
EDL	00:28:54,912	00:28:58,496	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Like it sounds like it sounds like lonely and then I can almost imagine because you're
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:28:59,264	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Your
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:00,032	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	By yourself
EDL	00:29:00,800	00:29:01,824	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Pretty-much on all fronts
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:08,224	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The country that you feel so a part of that you want to actually enlist in the military to fight for
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:10,272	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Doesn't seem to want you at that moment
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:12,576	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Your own Community doesn't seem to want you
EDL	00:29:12,576	00:29:14,112	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Your family
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:15,392	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It's a Shame by you
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,440	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Your girlfriend
EDL	00:29:17,952	00:29:18,720	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Is gone
EDL	00:29:20,256	00:29:22,560	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I can't imagine being more alone at this point
EDL	00:29:23,072	00:29:25,120	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Any never shared that with my brother I
EDL	00:29:26,144	00:29:27,680	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He shared it with my mother
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:31,008	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But but we didn't that wasn't part of our Peg dinner conversation
EDL	00:29:47,136	00:29:48,928	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We did it during World War II
EDL	00:29:49,440	00:29:55,584	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You know
EDL	00:30:01,984	00:30:05,824	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	What is speed
EDL	00:30:07,360	00:30:10,688	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	This is the crazy thing about the korematsu decision
EDL	00:30:10,688	00:30:11,200	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It is
EDL	00:30:11,712	00:30:12,736	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Still on the books
EDL	00:30:14,272	00:30:17,600	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That guy Carl Higbie got on Megyn Kelly and
EDL	00:30:17,600	00:30:18,624	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Said this
EDL	00:30:18,624	00:30:22,720	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Stuff about korematsu in the very next day he got on and apologize for saying that
EDL	00:30:23,232	00:30:24,256	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But he's right
EDL	00:30:24,256	00:30:27,328	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Korematsu is technically still good law
EDL	00:30:27,328	00:30:28,608	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Justice Antonin Scalia
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:30,144	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	One said
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:32,960	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That sherp korematsu was wrongly decided
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:35,520	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But if you think that it's not going to happen again
EDL	00:30:36,032	00:30:37,312	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You're kidding yourself
EDL	00:30:37,312	00:30:40,640	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The car isn't going to get across the president
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:42,176	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	An international America
EDL	00:30:45,248	00:30:47,040	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Would you like us to
EDL	00:30:47,808	00:30:49,088	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I think so
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:51,392	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You would you like it
EDL	00:30:52,416	00:30:52,928	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	No
EDL	00:30:53,440	00:30:56,512	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That's not injured in school yet it's a judge named Richard Posner
EDL	00:30:57,024	00:31:00,608	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Not the time that we talked to him he was on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals
EDL	00:31:01,120	00:31:02,912	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He was widely considered by
EDL	00:31:02,912	00:31:07,264	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	People on both the left and the right to be one of the most influential judges in the country
EDL	00:31:07,776	00:31:09,824	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He sometimes called the 10th Supreme Court Justice
EDL	00:31:10,592	00:31:14,176	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And he's a big defender of the korematsu decision
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:19,296	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	What do you say then to Fred korematsu what do you say then to to a Japanese-American about
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:21,344	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Kind of the law and the courts
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:23,904	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Well they were given compensation
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:28,000	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Right I mean Thursday
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:34,144	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	There is no pain suffering there is there there's an anguish right that we can
EDL	00:31:34,144	00:31:35,680	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Exactly commodify
EDL	00:31:35,680	00:31:38,240	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Yeah but
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:41,056	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	At the time it all happened
EDL	00:31:41,824	00:31:43,616	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Shortly after Pearl Harbor
EDL	00:31:44,896	00:31:48,736	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It seemed like the right thing to do and probably was the right thing to
EDL	00:31:49,760	00:31:51,296	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And I imagine that
EDL	00:31:51,296	00:31:52,832	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The officials and
EDL	00:31:53,600	00:31:56,160	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Federal government in
EDL	00:31:56,160	00:31:57,696	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	1941
EDL	00:31:57,696	00:32:02,560	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	They probably didn't know anything about Japanese-Americans on the West Coast
EDL	00:32:03,328	00:32:07,168	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Roosevelt ever compared to Japanese-American doubt it
EDL	00:32:07,168	00:32:07,936	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Like I just
EDL	00:32:07,936	00:32:08,704	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Thanks
EDL	00:32:09,984	00:32:12,544	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	The fact that he had never met anybody
EDL	00:32:12,544	00:32:17,152	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I might have been a reason for him to be more restrained in his executive orders right now
EDL	00:32:17,152	00:32:21,504	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	No because all he cares about is the defense of the United States
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:28,416	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	If there's any possibility of Japanese-Americans somehow cooperating with a Japanese invade
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:29,184	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Asian forced
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:30,976	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That he has to
EDL	00:32:30,976	00:32:33,536	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Move the Japanese-Americans
EDL	00:32:33,536	00:32:36,864	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	What's this I'm sure that's all he would have thought
EDL	00:32:38,912	00:32:40,448	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I mean I think it's all he did think
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:43,008	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But what else could you have thought of
EDL	00:32:44,032	00:32:45,824	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That's the only thing
EDL	00:32:45,824	00:32:47,104	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He is going to focus
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:49,664	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And if he doesn't he could be impeached
EDL	00:32:51,456	00:32:52,736	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Or he could also
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:57,600	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Worried about citizens right I think one of the look you're not you
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:33:00,160	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You're missing the priorities
EDL	00:33:00,160	00:33:01,952	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Is the priority is defense
EDL	00:33:02,976	00:33:06,304	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That's the priority that's what these people are thinking about
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,864	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You think they have time to be thinking about any
EDL	00:33:09,376	00:33:13,728	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Any kind of nice ideas for protecting people
EDL	00:33:13,728	00:33:14,752	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Any more than
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:17,568	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Lincoln did
EDL	00:33:18,592	00:33:24,992	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	What he's referring to there is a moment in 1861 when Abraham Lincoln basically tossed this alleged Confederate
EDL	00:33:24,992	00:33:26,272	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	In jail without due process
EDL	00:33:26,784	00:33:29,600	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Man Justified it by saying he had to save the Union
EDL	00:33:30,112	00:33:31,136	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Nikes
EDL	00:33:31,136	00:33:34,208	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney ruled against him
EDL	00:33:34,208	00:33:38,560	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Cheerleaders at all well Tony he's the Chief Justice and he said this
EDL	00:33:39,072	00:33:40,608	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Jerk should be released
EDL	00:33:41,120	00:33:43,936	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I guess I have to do that he's the Chief Justice
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:46,752	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	No you do that enough time
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:48,800	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	As the president you're out
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,336	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It seems to me that
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:52,640	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That's why we have courts
EDL	00:33:52,640	00:33:56,992	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We have all, that is not why we have
EDL	00:33:56,992	00:33:58,528	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	We do not have cords
EDL	00:33:59,296	00:34:01,600	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So that presidents can be checked
EDL	00:34:02,112	00:34:05,952	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Institchu ations of a national emergency
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:08,000	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That was my cords were set up
EDL	00:34:14,144	00:34:15,936	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Then what I mean
EDL	00:34:16,448	00:34:17,728	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I'm flailing now but
EDL	00:34:18,240	00:34:20,032	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Then what stops then what
EDL	00:34:20,032	00:34:23,360	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	If Congress can't stop them and if the courts can't stop them
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:26,688	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Like what can stop a president in a time of War
EDL	00:34:26,688	00:34:30,784	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	There's nobody that nobody can check that that's the president's responsibility
EDL	00:34:38,464	00:34:42,304	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Obviously I'd like a do-over because it somehow In the Heat of the Moment
EDL	00:34:42,816	00:34:43,840	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I forgot
EDL	00:34:43,840	00:34:48,704	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	That I'm talking about defending the rights of actual American citizens
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:50,752	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And Posner is talking about
EDL	00:34:50,752	00:34:51,776	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	People who are Rebel
EDL	00:34:52,288	00:34:52,800	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Tube country
EDL	00:34:54,336	00:34:56,640	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	There's probably a way where I could have said
EDL	00:34:57,152	00:34:58,176	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Pointed that out to him
EDL	00:34:59,968	00:35:01,760	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Friends of the Court stepping in
EDL	00:35:01,760	00:35:04,064	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I mean it happens it happens to Truman
EDL	00:35:04,064	00:35:06,112	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But you know judge Posner is right
EDL	00:35:06,112	00:35:07,648	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	But it doesn't happen
EDL	00:35:07,648	00:35:08,160	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	A lot
EDL	00:35:08,928	00:35:12,256	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Which is why he gets to be judge Posner and I'm the guy that had to check with a p
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:17,120	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And by the way do you think these Supreme Court Justices
EDL	00:35:17,120	00:35:19,168	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Are great big brains
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:20,704	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Pink Stars
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:24,544	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Who are selected because of the best lawyers in the United States
EDL	00:35:25,568	00:35:27,360	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And their decisions are
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:29,152	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Are usually great
EDL	00:35:29,152	00:35:30,176	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You think you all that
EDL	00:35:31,200	00:35:34,272	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I don't I don't have a high respect for the Supreme Court at all
EDL	00:35:41,440	00:35:42,720	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You look at them
EDL	00:35:42,720	00:35:44,512	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	How they are appointed who appoints
EDL	00:35:47,584	00:35:51,936	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	This is so why do you think the Supreme Court has such a great balance to the
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,728	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	President
EDL	00:35:55,264	00:36:01,664	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	This is what gets me up at
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:03,712	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Get me going because
EDL	00:36:03,712	00:36:05,504	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I still think it can be used as a present
EDL	00:36:06,016	00:36:09,600	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So your ears you're still worried that it can be used
EDL	00:36:10,112	00:36:10,880	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And that it
EDL	00:36:10,880	00:36:12,928	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Do you think it will be like you don't like
EDL	00:36:12,928	00:36:19,072	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You know I think we cannot take this for granted
EDL	00:36:25,728	00:36:32,128	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Fred korematsu couldn't get Justice inside Supreme Court question is
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:38,528	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Can you find it on the outside

EDL	00:36:56,192	00:36:59,520	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	This is more perfect mchat I can ride here with Julie Longoria
EDL	00:36:59,520	00:37:01,312	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	All right so getting back to the story of Fred
EDL	00:37:01,824	00:37:05,152	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Picking up from the decision what happened after that
EDL	00:37:05,152	00:37:06,176	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So the
EDL	00:37:06,176	00:37:10,784	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Internment camp where Fred was staying closed in 1945

EDL	00:37:15,904	00:37:17,696	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So he was living in Detroit
EDL	00:37:17,696	00:37:20,000	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He fell in love with a woman named Katherine

EDL	00:37:30,496	00:37:34,336	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Outside of the Japanese Community he was involved in Boy Scouts
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:40,224	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Girl Scouts so I was a girl scout so we have the camps when we had to open the camp he would work on that

EDL	00:38:28,608	00:38:32,448	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It was just too painful but this time there was a professor on the line
EDL	00:38:32,448	00:38:34,240	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	From the University of California Berkeley
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:37,568	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It was a Japanese guy actually and he told Fred
EDL	00:38:37,568	00:38:40,128	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	I really really want you to come into my class
EDL	00:38:40,128	00:38:42,432	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	There was a ethnic studies
EDL	00:38:42,432	00:38:46,784	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Class that was actually off-campus ethnic studies was not even recognize that
EDL	00:38:47,296	00:38:48,832	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	So he he talked
EDL	00:38:48,832	00:38:52,416	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Yet at this ethnic studies class and these kids were brutal
EDL	00:38:53,184	00:38:59,584	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Met UC Berkeley at that time had this in a notorious reputation of being very radical
EDL	00:38:59,584	00:39:05,984	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	People were asking questions during the whole hour this is Jean Quan former mayor of Oakland she was in the class that day
EDL	00:39:05,984	00:39:10,080	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	It was important times as you did as a different country like you have to learn up

EDL	00:39:15,456	00:39:21,344	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Why didn't you why didn't you protest why didn't you do this why didn't you do that why didn't you fight harder
EDL	00:39:21,344	00:39:22,624	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And we're almost
EDL	00:39:22,624	00:39:26,208	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You're angry that we he wasn't angry I think
EDL	00:39:26,208	00:39:30,816	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	You got to remember that a lot of these students even know anything about the count

EDL	00:39:44,896	00:39:46,432	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	And so they're really angry at their parents
EDL	00:39:46,944	00:39:47,968	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Surrogate or not
EDL	00:39:48,736	00:39:55,136	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	Red felt like he was being indicted all over again it it was such a painful experience for my father he never

EDL	00:40:26,624	00:40:28,928	| moreperfect062618_americanpendulumreprise |	He finds himself again on a college campus
