EDL	00:04:13,952	00:04:20,351	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	To forcibly remove anyone of Japanese ancestry from the West Coast
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:25,471	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	She goes on to explain these the horrific circumstances and
EDL	00:04:25,471	00:04:26,239	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	How

EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:02,239	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And it was at clear and simple

EDL	00:08:22,783	00:08:24,063	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	To have this happen
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:25,855	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I put them in chain
EDL	00:08:26,367	00:08:29,183	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	It was even hard to talk to them after that
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:35,583	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Fred had a traditional immigrant Japanese-American families
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:41,983	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	His parents were born in Japan and then all his brothers were born here in the US born in Oakland California
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:46,335	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He was the third out of four brothers and being the Third
EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:47,615	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	At the 2nd to the 1st
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:50,175	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That mattered absolutely
EDL	00:08:50,175	00:08:54,783	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Fred was anemic position as the third son he could resist
EDL	00:08:55,295	00:09:00,159	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	We asked laraine b'nai I teach at Seattle University School of Law for some contacts
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:06,303	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Kiawah professor and a friend of Fred's family the cultural tradition is that the first son is the favorite son
EDL	00:09:06,815	00:09:13,215	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The oldest was going to inherit the family garden and Nursery business II would help out with that business friend
EDL	00:09:13,215	00:09:14,239	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	As a third
EDL	00:09:14,239	00:09:16,799	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Sunbiz very low on the totem pole
EDL	00:09:16,799	00:09:21,407	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	His parents and have the same expectations of him relatively speaking he was kind of the hook
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:28,575	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Unlike his older brothers he didn't speak much Japanese and he felt more American than anything else
EDL	00:09:29,087	00:09:34,975	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	When I was in school we started each day for the Pledge of Allegiance I studied American history
EDL	00:09:34,975	00:09:37,535	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I always been a good American citizen
EDL	00:09:37,535	00:09:40,351	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So when he came home that Sunday when Pearl Harbor was attacked
EDL	00:09:40,863	00:09:43,167	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Is family's response to the whole thing was
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:44,959	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Unsettling
EDL	00:09:44,959	00:09:45,727	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I am
EDL	00:09:46,495	00:09:48,031	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I didn't know what to do
EDL	00:09:48,031	00:09:50,079	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And Fred says pretty soon after
EDL	00:09:50,591	00:09:51,615	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Things got very weird
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:56,223	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Within a few days I put spotlights on the whole Nursery at night
EDL	00:09:56,223	00:09:58,783	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And they had a guard standing right now
EDL	00:09:58,783	00:10:02,111	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Our home there around the fence there watching us
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:06,719	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Cuz I went out one night to have a cigarette and I was saying on the parts and I got a cigarette
EDL	00:10:07,743	00:10:11,071	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And I guarantee a lot if I was singling somebody
EDL	00:10:12,095	00:10:13,119	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Ridiculous
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:16,703	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Then came Roosevelt executive order
EDL	00:10:19,775	00:10:21,823	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That big order 906 6
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:25,151	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Authorized the military to make a series of smaller ones
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:27,199	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The first set of orders was a curfew order
EDL	00:10:27,199	00:10:31,551	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Saying that Japanese Italians and Germans were subject to a curfew
EDL	00:10:31,551	00:10:36,159	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Second order was a freeze order directed just at the Japanese on the West Coast
EDL	00:10:36,671	00:10:41,791	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They weren't allowed to leave the area and then the third order wasn't ordered that they could not
EDL	00:10:42,559	00:10:43,583	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	We met
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:44,863	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	On the West Coast
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:51,263	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Except for in the custody of an approved location by the army
EDL	00:10:51,263	00:10:55,871	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They're about 15 of these assembly centers
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:11:02,015	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Japanese-Americans were told to report to one of these centers by a certain date
EDL	00:11:02,783	00:11:07,391	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Brett's family began to scramble they had to worry about what they were going to take
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:13,791	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	What was going to happen to the nursery and still expecting my mother you know the attention and
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:16,863	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Worries so in the days before his family left
EDL	00:11:18,143	00:11:22,239	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Fred made a decision
EDL	00:11:22,751	00:11:29,151	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I am I had my own worries and I had my own girlfriend my own problem decided not to go with his fan
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,175	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I am
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,711	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Talk to them bedtime
EDL	00:11:33,247	00:11:34,783	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That I can want to
EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:36,831	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I won't leave with you
EDL	00:11:37,599	00:11:39,647	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You didn't want to leave item behind
EDL	00:11:39,647	00:11:42,975	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I thought maybe the two of them could make a break for it later on
EDL	00:11:42,975	00:11:43,743	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Leave the state
EDL	00:11:44,255	00:11:46,047	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Before the evacuation deadline
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,607	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And
EDL	00:11:49,375	00:11:50,911	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They said fine if you can do it
EDL	00:11:51,935	00:11:52,447	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Go ahead
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,263	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	She was the third son
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:12:02,175	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So he knew that his older brothers would be able to take care of the family and they said he was
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:04,479	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Was a grown-up and he should make his own decisions
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:09,087	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And so he did he went off and got his own apartment and its own job as a welder
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:11,391	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I'm kind of lived under the radar
EDL	00:12:13,439	00:12:18,047	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	News brothers would be there to take care of his parents if you're with the family
EDL	00:12:18,047	00:12:20,607	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Like my family or any Japanese family
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:24,447	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You feel the pressure in the
EDL	00:12:24,447	00:12:25,471	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Sadness
EDL	00:12:29,055	00:12:31,615	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But on the outside is different just like a normal
EDL	00:12:32,383	00:12:33,407	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	What if you know
EDL	00:12:33,407	00:12:35,455	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Just like we've been living all the time
EDL	00:12:37,759	00:12:39,039	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I felt right at home
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:43,391	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You know I'm an American citizen to you know
EDL	00:12:45,695	00:12:46,975	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I didn't feel guilty
EDL	00:12:48,255	00:12:50,815	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Cuz I don't think I did anything wrong
EDL	00:12:50,815	00:12:56,447	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You sense that he was politically aware at this point
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,007	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	If you're asking me about whether he
EDL	00:12:59,007	00:13:02,335	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Refuse to go as an act of political resistance
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,615	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I don't think initially
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,687	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Unconsciously he probably
EDL	00:13:06,687	00:13:10,015	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	New that what was happening to Japanese-Americans was wrong
EDL	00:13:11,039	00:13:14,367	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But I don't think he had the words for that we might have today
EDL	00:13:15,135	00:13:21,535	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Is on his way home from work one day that he reads in the newspaper
EDL	00:13:21,535	00:13:26,399	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Paper about his parents and all the other Japanese-Americans in the area being taken away to camp
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:32,799	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Baby's sick to my stomach and on that I can see my parents going in you.
EDL	00:13:32,799	00:13:33,567	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	My brothers
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:38,431	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Going to camp and I'm not there you know
EDL	00:13:38,431	00:13:44,831	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But that was only time that I felt kind of
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:50,975	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Lonely you know like what what am I going to do now you know
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:55,327	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	It begins to slowly down on him what he's done
EDL	00:13:56,095	00:13:59,679	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	By staying in the Bay Area he is officially breaking the law
EDL	00:14:00,447	00:14:05,055	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And he and Ida aren't sure what that means like will they be thrown in jail or worse
EDL	00:14:05,567	00:14:07,615	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He talks in the archives about how he's worried
EDL	00:14:08,127	00:14:09,407	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And I was worried to
EDL	00:14:09,919	00:14:12,223	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Because now he could get arrested
EDL	00:14:12,735	00:14:14,527	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So they start to think about their options
EDL	00:14:14,527	00:14:19,903	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Fred decides to get an ID with a Spanish sounding last name on it so we won't be recognized the Japanese
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:21,439	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And then
EDL	00:14:21,439	00:14:22,463	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Ida says
EDL	00:14:22,463	00:14:24,511	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Essentially that might not be enough
EDL	00:14:24,511	00:14:28,095	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	She pulled out an article regarding plastic surgery
EDL	00:14:29,119	00:14:30,655	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And
EDL	00:14:30,655	00:14:32,191	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	What do you think of this
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:36,287	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I looked it over and well
EDL	00:14:37,055	00:14:37,823	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I didn't
EDL	00:14:37,823	00:14:42,175	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Baker was a good idea but she said hey why don't you think about
EDL	00:14:42,175	00:14:46,527	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That's this might be a good thing that will allow you to stay here
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:49,599	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So the idea would be that he
EDL	00:14:49,599	00:14:55,999	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You don't have his eyes doubled or something like that a plastic surgery procedure where you put a fold in the III
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:56,767	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Gilead
EDL	00:14:56,767	00:14:58,303	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So you look more white less
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:15:01,119	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Japanese American
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:03,935	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And I guess I don't know
EDL	00:15:07,263	00:15:07,775	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Well
EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:10,079	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	She said she'll be looking to it
EDL	00:15:11,359	00:15:12,383	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And
EDL	00:15:13,151	00:15:19,551	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Nothing to lose so we decide to try it
EDL	00:15:19,551	00:15:24,927	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So Fred gets into his car and he drives into the city into San Francisco and he
EDL	00:15:26,207	00:15:28,255	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Just stops in front of the doctor's office
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,863	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	How do you start spacing
EDL	00:15:33,887	00:15:36,959	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Walking up the steps of this Victorian and then
EDL	00:15:37,727	00:15:42,847	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Walking down the steps to leave and he was a really crummy idea and then walking back up the steps
EDL	00:15:43,871	00:15:47,711	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Thinking well yeah maybe I just right it's a good idea on the down the steps
EDL	00:15:48,479	00:15:50,527	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	This is a ridiculous idea
EDL	00:15:50,527	00:15:54,367	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Giving some doctor your hard-earned money to
EDL	00:15:54,367	00:15:56,927	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Change your face
EDL	00:15:56,927	00:15:57,951	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Photos app
EDL	00:15:57,951	00:15:59,231	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And down
EDL	00:15:59,231	00:15:59,999	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And I
EDL	00:16:00,511	00:16:01,535	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I'm down
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:02,303	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And I
EDL	00:16:02,303	00:16:04,095	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Down until
EDL	00:16:05,631	00:16:06,655	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He decided to just
EDL	00:16:07,167	00:16:07,679	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Going
EDL	00:16:08,959	00:16:09,983	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And have the procedure done
EDL	00:16:10,751	00:16:12,543	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He really did it as a way to
EDL	00:16:12,543	00:16:15,103	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Protect them as they try to leave the state
EDL	00:16:16,383	00:16:22,015	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The doctor said he was going to work on his eyes and then also fix a broken nose I had a broken nose
EDL	00:16:22,015	00:16:24,319	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I'm playing football and I never had it fixed
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:25,855	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And
EDL	00:16:26,367	00:16:28,159	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So you could do pretty good work on me
EDL	00:16:29,183	00:16:31,999	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But it turned out he didn't do everything he said he would
EDL	00:16:31,999	00:16:33,023	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Regis
EDL	00:16:33,023	00:16:35,071	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Took my money that's what it was I join
EDL	00:16:35,839	00:16:37,887	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	There wasn't anything change except
EDL	00:16:37,887	00:16:40,447	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I didn't have a broken nose anymore
EDL	00:16:43,007	00:16:46,591	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So he drives back to the East Bay with a new nose but the same eyes
EDL	00:16:47,103	00:16:51,711	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And shortly after that day at the doctor's office he's out buying cigarettes at a convenience store
EDL	00:16:52,223	00:16:53,759	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Leclerc
EDL	00:16:55,807	00:16:57,599	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Recognized him and reported him
EDL	00:16:58,111	00:17:02,207	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And one day walking down the street he was stopped
EDL	00:17:02,719	00:17:03,231	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And arrest
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:06,559	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And
EDL	00:17:06,559	00:17:11,935	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Spent his Memorial Day and 1942 in the San Leandro jail
EDL	00:17:13,471	00:17:14,495	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	When we got caught
EDL	00:17:15,263	00:17:16,799	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They called her into
EDL	00:17:17,311	00:17:17,823	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Yeah
EDL	00:17:18,591	00:17:19,615	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And
EDL	00:17:22,687	00:17:23,967	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I see the police chief
EDL	00:17:24,479	00:17:26,015	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Talking to her for quite a while
EDL	00:17:28,575	00:17:34,719	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I imagine it's a small jail and he's just been admitted so he's sitting in the lobby and he sees I to come into the front.
EDL	00:17:36,255	00:17:40,863	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He's just out of earshot can't make out exactly what they're saying but at a certain point
EDL	00:17:40,863	00:17:42,143	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They stop talking
EDL	00:17:43,167	00:17:44,447	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	She just walks out
EDL	00:17:44,959	00:17:45,471	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,007	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That was the end of it
EDL	00:17:47,775	00:17:50,079	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I never did see her again
EDL	00:17:59,039	00:18:05,183	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They never saw each other
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:15,679	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So he sitting there alone in the Stanley
EDL	00:18:15,679	00:18:21,311	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	AndroGel and they end up transferring him to Oakland jail for some reason and then he ends up at
EDL	00:18:21,311	00:18:26,175	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The federal prison in San Francisco because resisting the order was a federal offense
EDL	00:18:26,175	00:18:27,455	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Anyway
EDL	00:18:29,759	00:18:32,831	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	One day I got a call from the guard
EDL	00:18:33,343	00:18:39,743	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And told me I had a visitor and I didn't know it was you know
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:46,143	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I knew all my friends were in can't or they were in the military but that goes down to the visiting room anyway
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:50,751	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And there's assman there
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:54,591	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Well I believe in civil liberties
EDL	00:18:54,591	00:18:57,919	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Right of people is being denied
EDL	00:18:57,919	00:19:04,063	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	This is something that i'm concerned about the man says his name is ernest besig
EDL	00:19:05,343	00:19:06,623	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Easier to talk to me
EDL	00:19:07,903	00:19:10,975	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He asked if I need some cigarettes or something like that you know
EDL	00:19:10,975	00:19:14,047	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Just to break the ice
EDL	00:19:14,047	00:19:16,095	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	By the way I asked him
EDL	00:19:16,607	00:19:18,399	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Who you represent
EDL	00:19:18,399	00:19:20,191	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And Earnest response well
EDL	00:19:21,215	00:19:27,615	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	ACLU or something like that
EDL	00:19:27,615	00:19:33,759	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	We have no way of knowing what exactly was said between Fred and Ernest besig
EDL	00:19:34,527	00:19:35,807	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Both men have passed away
EDL	00:19:36,319	00:19:40,671	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But it seems like something important must have happened in this conversation because
EDL	00:19:41,183	00:19:47,071	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	If I was Lori Benitez I don't think he had the words for that we might have today Fred
EDL	00:19:47,071	00:19:47,839	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Didn't have
EDL	00:19:48,607	00:19:50,143	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The language of resistance
EDL	00:19:50,143	00:19:51,167	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Before this moment
EDL	00:19:51,935	00:19:54,239	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Something in that conversation must have
EDL	00:19:54,239	00:19:55,007	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Giving it to him
EDL	00:19:55,519	00:19:57,823	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Because when Earnest basich asked him
EDL	00:19:57,823	00:20:00,895	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Do you want me to represent you in a court of law
EDL	00:20:01,407	00:20:02,687	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Fred says yes
EDL	00:20:05,503	00:20:07,295	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	What do you imagine the words worth it
EDL	00:20:08,575	00:20:10,111	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Might have turned him in that moment
EDL	00:20:11,647	00:20:12,671	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Imagine
EDL	00:20:13,183	00:20:13,951	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That
EDL	00:20:13,951	00:20:15,743	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Basic must have said to fraud
EDL	00:20:17,023	00:20:19,583	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	We think that was happened to Japanese Americans
EDL	00:20:20,351	00:20:21,887	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Is unconstitutional
EDL	00:20:21,887	00:20:25,471	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	We'd like to bring a lawsuit to say the Japanese Americans
EDL	00:20:25,471	00:20:27,263	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Are being sent away
EDL	00:20:27,263	00:20:28,543	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Only because of their race
EDL	00:20:29,567	00:20:30,591	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And in that
EDL	00:20:32,895	00:20:33,919	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Gay pride language
EDL	00:20:35,199	00:20:41,343	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But what I think Fred knew was wrong
EDL	00:20:54,399	00:21:00,799	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Basic try to get Fred out of jail but the military stepped in and said he had
EDL	00:21:00,799	00:21:02,335	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	How to join his family and camp
EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:06,175	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They were at a place called Tanforan race tracks
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,991	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	It was a temporary holding spot
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:13,855	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So that meant that the first place that Fred went after jail was
EDL	00:21:15,135	00:21:21,536	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	A converted horse stall and there's holes on the walls
EDL	00:21:21,536	00:21:24,096	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Just blew internal that's blue in there and everything
EDL	00:21:24,096	00:21:27,936	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And this was a small horse dog because bread ask for his own
EDL	00:21:27,936	00:21:32,544	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Wanted to sit and think about what to say to his family to were also at
EDL	00:21:32,544	00:21:33,568	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Tanforan
EDL	00:21:33,568	00:21:39,968	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Satin V single lone bear light bulb above and the smell of manure
EDL	00:21:39,968	00:21:43,808	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Hey I mean it's ready for horses not for human beings
EDL	00:21:49,952	00:21:52,256	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And then all sudden I hear a knock on the door
EDL	00:21:53,280	00:21:55,328	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And I opening with my brother
EDL	00:21:55,328	00:21:57,376	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Say you can't stay here you
EDL	00:21:57,376	00:21:58,144	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You got coming
EDL	00:21:58,656	00:21:59,424	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Cedar Park
EDL	00:22:05,312	00:22:08,640	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	We walk spread over to the Star Wars families been living
EDL	00:22:10,176	00:22:14,016	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And I was surprised the way they fixed up their stall
EDL	00:22:14,784	00:22:15,808	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They
EDL	00:22:15,808	00:22:17,856	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Solar panel cracks
EDL	00:22:18,368	00:22:23,232	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And they put newspaper for the walls in the paper that all up
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:26,560	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	This was a common thing for these families
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:31,936	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Thousands of them were transferred to more permanent camps and many stay there for up to 3 years
EDL	00:22:31,936	00:22:33,984	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Overtime
EDL	00:22:33,984	00:22:36,288	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The community
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:39,872	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Kind of tried to build lives for themselves
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:42,432	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	If your stories and see pictures
EDL	00:22:43,456	00:22:46,272	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	People building small Japanese gardens
EDL	00:22:48,064	00:22:49,600	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	What they found in the area
EDL	00:22:50,112	00:22:54,464	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	She saw newsreels about the people who made the Desert Bloom
EDL	00:22:55,744	00:23:01,376	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Eventually saw people
EDL	00:23:01,376	00:23:03,680	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Forming you know baseball teams
EDL	00:23:29,536	00:23:33,888	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	My brother he was involved in various Japanese activities
EDL	00:23:34,912	00:23:36,192	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And
EDL	00:23:36,960	00:23:39,776	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He thought it might be a good idea for me to
EDL	00:23:40,800	00:23:44,896	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Get some suggestions and opinions regarding to
EDL	00:23:46,688	00:23:48,480	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	If I should fight the case or not
EDL	00:23:50,784	00:23:52,832	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So Fred's brother calls a meeting
EDL	00:23:53,600	00:23:55,904	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You got about 30 young people together
EDL	00:23:55,904	00:23:58,464	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Imagine it was f****** a mess hall or something like that
EDL	00:23:58,976	00:24:01,024	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And they discussed Frets case
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:02,048	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They were
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:05,120	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Discussion is to themselves or in little groups
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:10,496	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And I stood around and waited for someone to speak
EDL	00:24:13,568	00:24:16,128	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But no one actually came out to speak to me
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:33,792	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I can see Fred kind of standing in a corner as people are gathered in small groups
EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:36,096	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Whispering to each other
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,912	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Stealing glances at him
EDL	00:24:47,872	00:24:54,016	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But no one says a word to him
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:03,232	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Finding one dead and you said Fred were undecided on
EDL	00:25:03,232	00:25:04,256	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	If I should find
EDL	00:25:04,256	00:25:05,536	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Acacia not because
EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:07,584	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They don't want to
EDL	00:25:08,864	00:25:10,656	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Make any more disturbance
EDL	00:25:11,680	00:25:13,984	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Anything to upset
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:16,800	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The parents right at the time because they were
EDL	00:25:16,800	00:25:19,872	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	To upset already and think just being in Camp
EDL	00:25:20,640	00:25:22,688	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They told him their parents have been through enough
EDL	00:25:22,688	00:25:24,224	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Leaving their lives behind
EDL	00:25:26,016	00:25:27,296	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Basically they said
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:28,320	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	We can't help you
EDL	00:25:34,464	00:25:39,328	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But there was one Japanese American group that did decide to say something about Fred's case
EDL	00:25:39,840	00:25:41,376	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	What's the name of the group
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,912	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Jacl
EDL	00:25:43,936	00:25:46,496	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Ernest bacak had a nickname for this group
EDL	00:25:46,496	00:25:48,544	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The Japanese-American Citizens League
EDL	00:25:48,544	00:25:49,824	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The jackals
EDL	00:25:50,592	00:25:51,104	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I meant
EDL	00:25:52,128	00:25:54,432	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	With a leadership of that group
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,712	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Several of them
EDL	00:25:55,712	00:25:56,736	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I purged them
EDL	00:25:57,248	00:25:58,784	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	To oppose
EDL	00:25:58,784	00:25:59,808	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The explosion
EDL	00:26:00,832	00:26:03,904	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But they didn't seem to be particularly interested
EDL	00:26:04,416	00:26:06,976	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The JCL condemned Frets case
EDL	00:26:06,976	00:26:09,536	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And anyone else who fought against the government orders
EDL	00:26:09,536	00:26:13,888	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Said it would not support any of these individuals were fighting the orders
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,424	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And called them
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:16,448	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Self-styled martyrs
EDL	00:26:17,216	00:26:19,264	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Wow they use that phrase
EDL	00:26:20,288	00:26:22,848	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They would basically get everyone else into trouble
EDL	00:26:24,640	00:26:26,432	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	To do this by myself
EDL	00:26:26,432	00:26:28,480	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I just wonder if I was doing wrong or
EDL	00:26:28,992	00:26:31,552	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Or maybe putting them in Shame by
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:33,344	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I'm bringing the issue up again
EDL	00:26:35,648	00:26:41,792	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Because of Japanese people lay their peaceful people when they they like to leave things alone if they can
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:47,168	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Because they were in enough trouble as it is because of this Pearl Harbor attack
EDL	00:26:47,680	00:26:49,984	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And the country blame them
EDL	00:26:49,984	00:26:52,800	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So they have the sort of a guilty complex
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:55,360	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Even though
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:56,896	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They have nothing to do with it
EDL	00:27:00,736	00:27:04,832	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Majority I'm just avoided me so therefore I assume that
EDL	00:27:10,464	00:27:11,232	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That
EDL	00:27:12,512	00:27:14,560	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I got myself in this problem
EDL	00:27:15,328	00:27:16,096	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And
EDL	00:27:17,632	00:27:20,448	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That was my problem than that and not theirs
EDL	00:27:23,264	00:27:29,664	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Fred continue to fight his case he argued that basically rounding up
EDL	00:27:29,664	00:27:36,064	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Thousands of Japanese-Americans American citizens without a trial without due process
EDL	00:27:36,064	00:27:40,416	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Basically amounted to racial discrimination
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:47,840	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Is case made its way up and down the courts and eventually two-and-a-half years after he met
EDL	00:27:47,840	00:27:49,376	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Pattern spastic in that jail cell
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,168	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The case arrives
EDL	00:27:51,680	00:27:52,960	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	At the Supreme Court
EDL	00:27:53,728	00:27:57,312	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Yo he said he thought that by the time his case got to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:27:57,312	00:27:59,872	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Bedspreads daughter Karen again he would
EDL	00:27:59,872	00:28:03,456	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Be able to vindicate his family and everyone that had been incarcerated
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:06,016	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And that's how much he believed in the Supreme Court
EDL	00:28:08,832	00:28:11,136	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And so when that didn't happen he felt like
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:14,208	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	If he felt like it was his fault
EDL	00:28:16,256	00:28:17,792	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That's a big bird to carry around
EDL	00:28:20,608	00:28:21,888	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	What ends up happening is
EDL	00:28:22,400	00:28:24,960	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	On December 18th 1944
EDL	00:28:24,960	00:28:26,240	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The Supreme Court
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,520	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Rules against Fred
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,312	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	It's kind of a
EDL	00:28:29,312	00:28:31,104	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Complicated decision
EDL	00:28:31,104	00:28:32,128	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:28:32,128	00:28:32,896	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Said
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:34,432	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Racial distinctions
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:36,480	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	When the government is making racial
EDL	00:28:36,480	00:28:40,064	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Distinction it's serious when you look at this very very carefully
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,624	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And that was a big president
EDL	00:28:43,136	00:28:44,160	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Sun a lot of ways
EDL	00:28:44,160	00:28:44,672	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	It's
EDL	00:28:45,184	00:28:45,952	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Kind of
EDL	00:28:46,464	00:28:49,280	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Victory for people fighting racial discrimination
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:51,584	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But then the court turned around and said
EDL	00:28:52,352	00:28:55,168	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Even though racial distinctions are serious
EDL	00:28:55,680	00:28:56,448	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	This one
EDL	00:28:57,216	00:28:58,240	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Is not
EDL	00:28:58,240	00:28:59,520	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Strictly racial
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:03,104	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	We are at war with the Japanese empire there for
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:05,408	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Rounding up Japanese-American Citizens
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:07,456	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Is a way to
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,480	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Defend the nation
EDL	00:29:12,320	00:29:13,600	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	How's your friend at this point
EDL	00:29:14,112	00:29:17,696	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Like it sounds like it sounds like lonely and then I can almost imagine because you're
EDL	00:29:17,696	00:29:18,464	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Your
EDL	00:29:18,464	00:29:19,232	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	By yourself
EDL	00:29:20,000	00:29:21,024	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Pretty-much on all fronts
EDL	00:29:22,048	00:29:27,168	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The country that you feel so a part of that you want to actually enlist in the military to fight for
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:29,472	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Doesn't seem to want you that moment
EDL	00:29:29,472	00:29:31,520	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Your own Community doesn't seem to want you
EDL	00:29:32,032	00:29:33,312	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Your family
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:34,592	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Is a Shame by you
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,640	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Your girlfriend
EDL	00:29:37,152	00:29:37,920	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Is gone
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:41,760	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I can't imagine being more alone at this point
EDL	00:29:42,272	00:29:44,320	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Any never shared that with my brother I
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:50,208	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He shared it with my mother but but we didn't that wasn't part of our dinner conversation
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:01,472	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	From Muslim
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:14,784	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You know
EDL	00:30:21,184	00:30:25,024	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	What is speed
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:29,888	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	This is the crazy thing about the korematsu decision
EDL	00:30:29,888	00:30:30,400	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	It is
EDL	00:30:30,912	00:30:31,936	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Still on the books
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:36,544	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That guy Carl Higbie got on Megyn Kelly and
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:37,824	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Said this
EDL	00:30:37,824	00:30:41,920	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Stuff about korematsu in the very next day he got on and apologize for saying that
EDL	00:30:42,432	00:30:43,456	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But he's right
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:46,528	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Korematsu is technically still good law
EDL	00:30:46,528	00:30:48,320	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Justice Antonin Scalia
EDL	00:30:48,320	00:30:49,344	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	One said
EDL	00:30:49,344	00:30:52,160	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That sherp korematsu was wrongly decided
EDL	00:30:52,160	00:30:54,720	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But if you think that it's not going to happen again
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,512	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You're kidding yourself
EDL	00:30:56,512	00:30:59,840	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Do the cord isn't going to get across the president
EDL	00:30:59,840	00:31:01,376	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	An international marriage
EDL	00:31:04,448	00:31:06,240	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Would you like us to
EDL	00:31:07,008	00:31:08,288	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I think so
EDL	00:31:09,824	00:31:10,592	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You would you like it
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,128	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	No
EDL	00:31:12,640	00:31:15,712	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That's not injured in school yet it's a judge named Richard Posner
EDL	00:31:16,224	00:31:19,808	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Not the time that we talked to him he was on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals
EDL	00:31:20,320	00:31:22,112	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He was widely considered by
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:26,464	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	People on both the left and the right to be one of the most influential judges in the country
EDL	00:31:26,976	00:31:29,024	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He sometimes called the 10th Supreme Court Justice
EDL	00:31:30,048	00:31:33,376	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And he's a big defender of the korematsu decision
EDL	00:31:33,888	00:31:39,008	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	What do you say then to Fred korematsu what do you say then to to a Japanese-American about
EDL	00:31:39,008	00:31:40,544	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Kind of the law and the courts
EDL	00:31:41,312	00:31:43,104	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Well they were given compensation
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,200	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Right I mean Thursday
EDL	00:31:49,248	00:31:53,344	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	There is no pain suffering there is there there's an anguish right that we can
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:54,624	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Exactly commodify
EDL	00:31:55,136	00:31:57,440	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Yeah but
EDL	00:31:58,208	00:32:00,256	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	At the time it all happened
EDL	00:32:01,024	00:32:02,816	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Shortly after Pearl Harbor
EDL	00:32:04,096	00:32:08,192	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	It seemed like the right thing to do and probably was the right thing to
EDL	00:32:08,192	00:32:08,960	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	To go
EDL	00:32:08,960	00:32:10,496	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And I imagine that
EDL	00:32:10,496	00:32:12,032	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The officials and
EDL	00:32:12,800	00:32:15,360	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Federal government in
EDL	00:32:15,360	00:32:16,896	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	1941
EDL	00:32:16,896	00:32:21,760	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	They probably didn't know anything about Japanese-Americans on the West Coast
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:26,368	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Roosevelt never committed Japanese-American I doubt it
EDL	00:32:26,368	00:32:27,136	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Like I just
EDL	00:32:27,136	00:32:27,904	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Think that meow
EDL	00:32:28,416	00:32:31,744	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The fact that he had never met anybody
EDL	00:32:31,744	00:32:36,352	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I might have been a reason for him to be more restrained in his executive orders right now
EDL	00:32:36,352	00:32:39,424	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	No because all he cares about is
EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:40,704	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Defense of the United States
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:47,616	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	If there's any possibility of Japanese-Americans somehow cooperating with a Japanese invade
EDL	00:32:47,616	00:32:48,384	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Asian forced
EDL	00:32:48,896	00:32:50,176	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That he has to
EDL	00:32:50,176	00:32:52,736	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Move the Japanese-Americans
EDL	00:32:52,736	00:32:56,064	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	What's this I'm sure that's all he would have thought
EDL	00:32:58,112	00:32:59,904	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I think it's all he did think of
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:02,208	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But what else could have thought of
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:05,024	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That's the only thing
EDL	00:33:05,024	00:33:06,304	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He is going to focus
EDL	00:33:06,816	00:33:08,864	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And if he doesn't he could be impeached
EDL	00:33:10,656	00:33:16,800	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Or he could also worried about citizens right now I think one of the look you're not you
EDL	00:33:17,312	00:33:19,360	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You're missing the priorities
EDL	00:33:19,360	00:33:20,896	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Is the priority is to
EDL	00:33:20,896	00:33:21,408	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Fence
EDL	00:33:22,176	00:33:25,504	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That's the priority that's what these people are thinking about
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:28,064	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You think they have time to be thinking about any
EDL	00:33:28,576	00:33:32,928	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Any kind of nice ideas for protecting people
EDL	00:33:32,928	00:33:33,952	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Any more than
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:36,768	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Lincoln did
EDL	00:33:37,792	00:33:44,192	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	What he's referring to there is a moment in 1861 when Abraham Lincoln basically tossed this alleged Confederate
EDL	00:33:44,192	00:33:45,472	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	In jail without due process
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:48,800	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And then Justified it by saying he had to save the Union
EDL	00:33:49,312	00:33:50,080	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Nikes
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:53,408	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Supreme Court Justice Roger Taney ruled against him
EDL	00:33:53,408	00:33:57,760	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Cheerleaders at all well Tony he's the Chief Justice and he said this
EDL	00:33:58,272	00:33:59,808	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Jerk should be released
EDL	00:34:00,320	00:34:03,136	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I guess I have to do that he's the Chief Justice
EDL	00:34:03,648	00:34:05,952	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	No you do that enough time
EDL	00:34:05,952	00:34:08,000	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	As the president you're out
EDL	00:34:08,512	00:34:09,536	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	It seems to me that
EDL	00:34:10,048	00:34:11,840	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That's why we have courts
EDL	00:34:11,840	00:34:16,192	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	We help, we have
EDL	00:34:16,192	00:34:17,728	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	We do not have cords
EDL	00:34:18,496	00:34:20,800	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So that presidents can be checked
EDL	00:34:21,312	00:34:25,152	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Institutions of a national emergency
EDL	00:34:25,152	00:34:27,200	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That was my cords were set up
EDL	00:34:33,344	00:34:35,648	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Then what I mean
EDL	00:34:35,648	00:34:36,928	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I'm flailing now but
EDL	00:34:37,440	00:34:39,232	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Then what stops then what
EDL	00:34:39,232	00:34:42,560	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	If Congress can't stop them and if the courts can't stop him
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:45,888	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Like what can stop a president in a time of War
EDL	00:34:45,888	00:34:49,728	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	There's nobody that nobody can check that that's the president's response
EDL	00:34:49,728	00:34:50,240	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Stillwater
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,456	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Obviously I'd like a do-over
EDL	00:34:59,456	00:35:01,504	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Because somehow In the Heat of the Moment
EDL	00:35:02,016	00:35:03,040	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I forgot
EDL	00:35:03,040	00:35:03,808	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	That
EDL	00:35:03,808	00:35:07,904	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I'm talking about defending the rights of actual American citizen
EDL	00:35:07,904	00:35:09,952	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And Posner is talking about
EDL	00:35:09,952	00:35:10,976	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	People who are Rebels
EDL	00:35:11,488	00:35:12,000	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	To the country
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:15,840	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	There is probably a way where I could have said
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:17,376	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Pointed that out to him
EDL	00:35:19,168	00:35:20,960	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Friends of the Court definition
EDL	00:35:20,960	00:35:23,264	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I mean it happens it happens to Truman
EDL	00:35:23,264	00:35:25,312	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But you know her is right
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:26,848	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But it doesn't happen
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,360	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	A lot
EDL	00:35:28,128	00:35:31,456	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Which is why he gets to be judge Posner and I'm the guy that had to check with a p
EDL	00:35:32,736	00:35:36,320	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And by the way do you think these Supreme Court Justices
EDL	00:35:36,320	00:35:38,368	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Are great big brains
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:39,904	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Pink Stars
EDL	00:35:40,416	00:35:43,744	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Who are selected because of the best lawyers in the United States
EDL	00:35:44,768	00:35:46,560	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And their decisions are
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:49,376	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Are usually great you think of all that
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:53,472	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I don't I don't have a high respect for the Supreme Court at all
EDL	00:36:00,640	00:36:01,920	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You look at them
EDL	00:36:01,920	00:36:03,712	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	How they are appointed who appoints
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:11,648	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	This is so why do you think the Supreme Court has such a great balance to the
EDL	00:36:11,648	00:36:12,928	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	President
EDL	00:36:14,464	00:36:20,864	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	This is what gets me up
EDL	00:36:20,864	00:36:22,912	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Get me going because
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:24,704	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I still think it can be used at the Press
EDL	00:36:25,216	00:36:28,800	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So you're you're you're still worried that it can be used
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:30,080	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And that it
EDL	00:36:30,080	00:36:32,128	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Do you think it will be like you don't like
EDL	00:36:32,128	00:36:35,200	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You know I think we cannot take this for granted
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:48,256	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Since Fred korematsu couldn't get Justice inside spring
EDL	00:36:48,256	00:36:54,656	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Question is can you find it on the outside
EDL	00:36:54,656	00:37:00,800	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Perfect will continue in a second
EDL	00:37:16,416	00:37:20,000	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	More perfect I'm Jedi vim Rod here with Julie Longoria

EDL	00:37:22,304	00:37:28,704	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Picking up from the decision what happened after that so the internment camp where Fred was staying

EDL	00:37:32,544	00:37:34,848	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Fred has gotten permission by that point to work
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:36,384	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	At a steel mill in Detroit

EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:31,168	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	But she says in like 1969 ish
EDL	00:38:31,168	00:38:34,496	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	68 or 69 when the world was in a very different place

EDL	00:38:40,384	00:38:41,408	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Of all things
EDL	00:38:41,408	00:38:43,200	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Tell me my father we get phone calls
EDL	00:38:43,200	00:38:48,320	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	From law student when the interview on but he really didn't want to talk about his case much
EDL	00:38:48,320	00:38:49,088	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	She just
EDL	00:38:49,088	00:38:54,720	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	It was just too painful but this time there was a professor on the line from the University of California Berkeley
EDL	00:38:54,720	00:38:57,536	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	It was a Japanese guy actually and he told Fred
EDL	00:38:58,048	00:39:04,448	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	I really really want you to come into my class there are was a ethnic studies class that was actually off
EDL	00:39:04,448	00:39:05,216	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Off campus
EDL	00:39:05,216	00:39:07,264	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Ethnic studies was not even recognize that
EDL	00:39:07,776	00:39:09,312	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	So he he talked
EDL	00:39:09,312	00:39:12,640	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Yet at this ethnic studies class and these kids were brutal
EDL	00:39:13,408	00:39:16,224	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Me UC Berkeley at that time had the snow
EDL	00:39:16,224	00:39:17,504	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Notorious
EDL	00:39:17,504	00:39:22,368	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Reputation of being very radical for asking questions during the whole hour
EDL	00:39:22,368	00:39:28,768	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	This is Jean Quan former mayor of Oakland she was in the class that day and it was important
EDL	00:39:28,768	00:39:35,168	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Different country like you have to learn up stand up to Authority and certainly these students were like DLC astounding say
EDL	00:39:35,168	00:39:36,704	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Well why didn't you
EDL	00:39:36,704	00:39:40,032	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Why didn't you protest why didn't you do this why didn't you do that
EDL	00:39:40,032	00:39:41,056	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Why didn't you fight
EDL	00:39:41,056	00:39:42,848	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Harder and we're almost
EDL	00:39:42,848	00:39:46,176	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You're angry that we he wasn't angry I think
EDL	00:39:46,688	00:39:51,296	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	You got to remember that a lot of these students even know anything about the counts
EDL	00:39:51,808	00:39:56,416	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Many many kids had not had Frank discussions with her own Tara and so
EDL	00:39:56,416	00:39:58,976	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Was korematsu it was probably a surrogate for like
EDL	00:39:59,744	00:40:00,256	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Your parents
EDL	00:40:00,768	00:40:04,864	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	How could they have gone to that and never told me they had no right not to tell me
EDL	00:40:05,376	00:40:06,912	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And so they're really angry at their parents
EDL	00:40:07,424	00:40:08,448	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Surrogate or not
EDL	00:40:09,216	00:40:15,616	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Red felt like he was being indicted all over again it it was such a painful experience for my father he never want
EDL	00:40:15,616	00:40:16,640	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	How to speak to anyone again
EDL	00:40:27,136	00:40:30,464	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Fred would ultimately challenge his conviction in a lower court
EDL	00:40:30,976	00:40:31,744	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And you would win
EDL	00:40:32,512	00:40:35,072	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	The Supreme Court decision still stands
EDL	00:40:35,584	00:40:37,888	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He was able to clear his own personal name
EDL	00:40:41,984	00:40:43,520	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Around 1990
EDL	00:40:44,288	00:40:46,336	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	Again the world in a very different place
EDL	00:40:47,104	00:40:49,408	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	He finds himself again on a college campus

EDL	00:41:11,680	00:41:14,240	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	And then they come upon this group of students
EDL	00:41:14,240	00:41:15,520	| moreperfect100117_americanpendulumi |	A group of
