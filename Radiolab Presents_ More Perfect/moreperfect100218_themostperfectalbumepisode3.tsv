EDL	00:01:37,024	00:01:38,560	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Is audio liner notes

EDL	00:01:40,352	00:01:43,680	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The short little stories that illuminate some aspect of the amendment
EDL	00:01:44,192	00:01:45,216	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Now the first 8 amendments
EDL	00:01:45,984	00:01:46,752	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	We're very clear
EDL	00:01:48,032	00:01:48,800	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Right to free speech
EDL	00:01:49,312	00:01:50,080	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Right to bear arms
EDL	00:01:51,616	00:01:52,128	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	3rd Amendment
EDL	00:01:52,640	00:01:53,408	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Whatever
EDL	00:01:53,408	00:01:55,200	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	But then you know you get to the amendments
EDL	00:01:55,712	00:01:58,272	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Talk about the rights you have when you are arrested by the police
EDL	00:01:59,296	00:02:00,576	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Superman effect concrete
EDL	00:02:02,624	00:02:03,136	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	But then
EDL	00:02:04,416	00:02:05,440	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Things get Spacey
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:07,744	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Unhinged
EDL	00:02:09,024	00:02:09,792	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Untethered
EDL	00:02:11,072	00:02:13,632	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Especially when you get to the next three 9th Amendment
EDL	00:02:13,632	00:02:14,656	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	10th Amendment
EDL	00:02:14,656	00:02:15,424	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	11th dimension
EDL	00:02:16,704	00:02:17,728	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	This tremendous
EDL	00:02:23,872	00:02:24,640	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	A little bit trippy
EDL	00:02:26,688	00:02:32,832	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Not to say they're not important some people would argue they're the most important amendments but it's just that they're very hard to understand by Joe
EDL	00:02:33,344	00:02:34,112	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Reading the text
EDL	00:02:34,880	00:02:37,696	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Can I have to talk about them by talking about something else
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:38,976	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	That makes me sad
EDL	00:02:39,744	00:02:40,768	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So that's what we're going to do
EDL	00:02:41,536	00:02:42,560	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Play the songs
EDL	00:02:42,560	00:02:43,840	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Second for the moment
EDL	00:02:43,840	00:02:46,144	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The liner notes we're trying use metaphor
EDL	00:02:46,656	00:02:47,680	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	To bring these
EDL	00:02:47,680	00:02:48,960	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Spacey amendments
EDL	00:02:49,472	00:02:50,496	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Back down to earth
EDL	00:02:50,496	00:02:51,264	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Starting with
EDL	00:02:51,264	00:02:52,288	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	9th Amendment
EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:54,592	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The Knights Inn on enumerated rights retained by P
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:58,432	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The enumeration in the Constitution
EDL	00:02:58,432	00:02:58,944	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Of certain rights
EDL	00:02:59,456	00:03:03,552	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people
EDL	00:03:05,088	00:03:05,600	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Yeah
EDL	00:03:06,624	00:03:09,952	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Listen to one more option in the constitution of certain rights
EDL	00:03:10,464	00:03:14,560	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:17,632	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So I've been reading about the 9th Amendment
EDL	00:03:17,632	00:03:20,960	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	More perfect producer and learning the basically
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:24,288	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The reason it's around is because the framers wanted to cover their asses
EDL	00:03:27,360	00:03:31,200	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Basically the 9th looks back at the previous eight amendments and it says
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:35,552	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Deserve rights but they are only rights
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:37,344	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	You got way more rights than that
EDL	00:03:37,856	00:03:38,880	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Pictures aren't written down
EDL	00:03:39,648	00:03:41,696	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Which I guess makes sense but
EDL	00:03:42,208	00:03:42,976	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Does it
EDL	00:03:42,976	00:03:44,256	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I mean
EDL	00:03:44,256	00:03:47,584	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	We can pretty much choose to do anything that isn't illegal
EDL	00:03:47,584	00:03:49,632	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	But there are lots of things aren't
EDL	00:03:49,632	00:03:51,424	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Constitutional guarantees
EDL	00:03:51,936	00:03:52,704	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I mean
EDL	00:03:52,704	00:03:53,728	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Mckown
EDL	00:03:53,728	00:03:59,360	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	If we have boundless 9th Amendment rights why don't we have a guaranteed right to marijuana
EDL	00:03:59,360	00:04:01,408	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Are free refills window seats
EDL	00:04:01,408	00:04:07,040	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The right the complimentary dinner mints the right to tasting tiny pieces of candy out of those bulk container right.
EDL	00:04:07,040	00:04:08,064	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Ice cream for breakfast
EDL	00:04:09,088	00:04:12,416	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Everyday it's just like it's super vague and I
EDL	00:04:12,928	00:04:18,047	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Wanted to know how to understand it better so I started Googling whatever I could
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,351	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And I came across a professor
EDL	00:04:20,351	00:04:25,983	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	This is Judith bear from Texas A&M University political science
EDL	00:04:25,983	00:04:30,335	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And I specialize in public law and you just told me about a case
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:32,895	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Call Griswold versus Connecticut
EDL	00:04:35,455	00:04:39,551	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The story of Griswold vs Connecticut begins in 1961
EDL	00:04:39,551	00:04:43,903	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Okay Estelle Griswold was the executive director
EDL	00:04:43,903	00:04:46,975	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut
EDL	00:04:47,487	00:04:52,095	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Still got together with a Yale med school gynecologist named Sealy Buxton
EDL	00:04:52,863	00:04:55,935	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Started a clinic in New Haven
EDL	00:04:56,703	00:05:00,287	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Popular in the community they had lots of clients
EDL	00:05:00,799	00:05:03,871	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And within ten days the police shut them down
EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:12,575	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Because keep in mind this was before Roe v Wade and in Connecticut in the mid-60s
EDL	00:05:14,367	00:05:16,415	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The use of any
EDL	00:05:16,415	00:05:17,695	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Contraception
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:23,839	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	It was illegal to even use birth control so it was super illegal to start a clinic where you coach women
EDL	00:05:23,839	00:05:25,375	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	In married couples about it
EDL	00:05:25,375	00:05:31,519	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	But it's all Griswold was doing it anyway I think it's very evident unenforceable
EDL	00:05:31,519	00:05:34,079	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I think if you had a policeman under every bed
EDL	00:05:34,079	00:05:40,479	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	In the state of Connecticut they still could not prove anything this is tape of Estelle Griswold from that time
EDL	00:05:40,479	00:05:41,247	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Continuing
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,527	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Baby illegally
EDL	00:05:43,039	00:05:45,087	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	But we are continuing our program
EDL	00:05:45,087	00:05:48,671	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So in the late fall of 1961
EDL	00:05:49,183	00:05:50,719	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	We issue two warrants
EDL	00:05:51,231	00:05:57,631	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	One against Estelle Griswold and the other against dr. Seely Buxton
EDL	00:05:57,631	00:05:59,167	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Buxton are arrested
EDL	00:05:59,167	00:06:02,239	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	In violation of the contraceptive statue
EDL	00:06:04,799	00:06:05,823	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	What happens next
EDL	00:06:05,823	00:06:07,103	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Is the clinic at shuttered
EDL	00:06:07,615	00:06:08,383	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	They go to court
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:11,967	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The case makes it all the way up to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:06:11,967	00:06:13,759	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And eventually they win in a way
EDL	00:06:14,271	00:06:15,807	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The field was very obvious
EDL	00:06:15,807	00:06:17,087	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	An incredibly odd
EDL	00:06:18,623	00:06:19,647	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Also like
EDL	00:06:19,647	00:06:22,463	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Somewhat metaphysical in the opinion
EDL	00:06:22,975	00:06:26,559	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	William O Douglas the Justice who wrote for the court
EDL	00:06:26,559	00:06:31,167	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Wrote the various guarantees create zones of privacy
EDL	00:06:31,679	00:06:34,239	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Amendments here the first
EDL	00:06:34,239	00:06:36,543	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	3rd the 4th and 9th V
EDL	00:06:36,543	00:06:41,919	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Saying they all guarantee privacy and if a woman wants use birth control in her own home
EDL	00:06:41,919	00:06:43,711	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Are privacy there should be protected
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:45,503	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Privacy is important
EDL	00:06:45,503	00:06:46,015	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Got it
EDL	00:06:46,527	00:06:47,039	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	But
EDL	00:06:47,807	00:06:50,879	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Things get weird when you realize the word privacy
EDL	00:06:50,879	00:06:54,463	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And is privacy mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. Absolutely not
EDL	00:06:54,975	00:06:56,511	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Is nowhere to be found
EDL	00:06:57,023	00:07:02,143	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The actual word privacy is written exactly zero times in the US Constitution
EDL	00:07:02,655	00:07:05,471	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	We all believe that we do in fact have that right
EDL	00:07:06,239	00:07:07,263	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	What to make of this
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:08,031	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Well
EDL	00:07:08,031	00:07:13,151	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	In the Griswold case Douglas offers the following explanation Douglas
EDL	00:07:13,663	00:07:19,039	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	That certain constitutional guarantees have the numbers
EDL	00:07:20,319	00:07:22,623	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Formed by emanations
EDL	00:07:24,159	00:07:25,695	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	From these right
EDL	00:07:25,695	00:07:32,095	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Snake gives them light and substance
EDL	00:07:32,095	00:07:35,679	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Numbers combinations light

EDL	00:07:38,495	00:07:39,775	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	It's so it almost sounds like
EDL	00:07:40,799	00:07:42,847	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I'm just so captivated because it just
EDL	00:07:42,847	00:07:47,455	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	It sounds so physical it doesn't sound that high-level law it's like
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:49,247	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Penumbra
EDL	00:07:49,247	00:07:51,807	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Comes from two Latin words
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:54,111	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Meaning gear
EDL	00:07:54,111	00:07:54,879	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Shadow
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:59,743	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So you're using a metaphor from the natural world
EDL	00:08:00,511	00:08:02,303	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	To describe an idea
EDL	00:08:03,071	00:08:08,959	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Justice William O Douglas said the all our constitutional rights have penumbra's of emanation stretching out into space
EDL	00:08:10,751	00:08:11,263	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Imagine
EDL	00:08:12,031	00:08:13,567	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	An exploding star
EDL	00:08:14,335	00:08:20,735	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	A supernova this glowing white ball with light radiating out in every direction into the Vas
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:24,319	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Space
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:30,463	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So according to him while the law doesn't say anything about privacy explicitly
EDL	00:08:30,975	00:08:32,255	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Pepsi is kind of
EDL	00:08:33,279	00:08:35,839	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Contained in the space that
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:37,375	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The law emanates
EDL	00:08:37,887	00:08:38,655	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Into
EDL	00:08:41,215	00:08:41,983	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Something
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:42,751	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Hello
EDL	00:08:42,751	00:08:43,775	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Hello the soccer cup
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:47,615	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	It is and I'm going to take you off on speakerphone
EDL	00:08:48,127	00:08:49,407	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I think I'm going to take you off this
EDL	00:08:49,407	00:08:49,919	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Speakerphone
EDL	00:08:50,687	00:08:53,247	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Why did they go
EDL	00:08:53,247	00:08:54,271	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Where is it
EDL	00:08:54,271	00:08:58,623	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Idea that we can understand the 9th Amendment through
EDL	00:09:00,415	00:09:01,951	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Cosmic metaphor
EDL	00:09:02,719	00:09:05,791	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Now that's so beautiful weird
EDL	00:09:05,791	00:09:11,679	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Headset no so vague like everytime I really try and wrap my head around it it's just
EDL	00:09:11,679	00:09:13,983	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	No I think you're still in doubt
EDL	00:09:14,495	00:09:15,263	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And so
EDL	00:09:15,263	00:09:19,359	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I thought maybe I just need to understand what a penumbra actually
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:19,871	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Is
EDL	00:09:20,895	00:09:23,455	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So I called the guy who knows
EDL	00:09:23,455	00:09:29,855	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Hello yes I'm on speakers no longer we do not understand how that happened it is strictly magical
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,647	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Probably in a
EDL	00:09:31,647	00:09:33,439	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Black hole vortex
EDL	00:09:33,439	00:09:37,535	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	This is dr. Ed cropp director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles
EDL	00:09:38,047	00:09:44,447	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Doctor cup is an astronomer knows a lot about the numbers so I asked him for a definition Umbra
EDL	00:09:44,447	00:09:45,727	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Is a Zone
EDL	00:09:45,727	00:09:47,263	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Eyeshadow out
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:50,335	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Side of the main Central shadow
EDL	00:09:50,335	00:09:52,127	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	That is cast by
EDL	00:09:52,127	00:09:54,687	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	A Celestial light like the
EDL	00:09:54,687	00:09:55,199	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The Sun
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:59,295	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Think about a solar eclipse where the Moon is casting a shadow on the Earth
EDL	00:09:59,807	00:10:01,855	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The deep dark center part of that
EDL	00:10:01,855	00:10:03,135	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Shadow is called
EDL	00:10:03,135	00:10:09,535	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The Umbra and the penumbra is the less dark outer fuzzy edge of that shadow where
EDL	00:10:09,535	00:10:10,303	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	What is deep
EDL	00:10:10,303	00:10:13,375	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So kind of like the furry shadow on the edge of a dark shadow
EDL	00:10:13,375	00:10:13,887	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	A little
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:21,823	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	My suspicion is that you've probably not seen a total solar eclipse that correct
EDL	00:10:21,823	00:10:26,175	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Last year doesn't count feels like it counts
EDL	00:10:26,175	00:10:29,503	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The the fact okay whatever
EDL	00:10:30,015	00:10:34,111	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I asked him based on his understanding of the numbers and astronomy
EDL	00:10:34,879	00:10:40,767	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	What do you think Douglass meant when he said certain constitutional guarantees have
EDL	00:10:40,767	00:10:44,863	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Penumbra's formed by emanations
EDL	00:10:44,863	00:10:46,399	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	From these right
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:52,543	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Give them light and substance like does that make sense to him as an astronomer
EDL	00:10:54,335	00:10:57,151	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	No no no no no
EDL	00:10:57,151	00:11:03,295	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Night I certainly understand how you're saying about the love but that's a different thing than the actual
EDL	00:11:03,295	00:11:04,575	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Experience of the penumbra
EDL	00:11:05,087	00:11:10,719	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So sure if you want to think about it if it's the law if it's a light source it would emanate
EDL	00:11:11,231	00:11:11,743	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Light
EDL	00:11:12,255	00:11:13,023	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Which
EDL	00:11:13,023	00:11:15,583	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Could create a shadow but the shadow doesn't
EDL	00:11:15,583	00:11:16,863	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Give the light
EDL	00:11:16,863	00:11:18,143	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	It's light in substance
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,679	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	It already
EDL	00:11:20,191	00:11:20,959	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	How's the light
EDL	00:11:21,983	00:11:22,751	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Inside of it
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:24,031	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And
EDL	00:11:26,079	00:11:27,871	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	You know it's it's
EDL	00:11:29,151	00:11:30,175	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Difficult
EDL	00:11:30,175	00:11:31,455	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	For me to
EDL	00:11:34,271	00:11:35,551	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Endorse
EDL	00:11:35,551	00:11:39,391	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	That that that analogy
EDL	00:11:40,415	00:11:41,183	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Douglas
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:42,207	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	What did you mean
EDL	00:11:43,743	00:11:45,791	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Does it surprise you that
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,071	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	His metaphor doesn't hold up
EDL	00:11:49,119	00:11:50,399	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	No not at all
EDL	00:11:50,399	00:11:53,983	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	This is David J Garrow
EDL	00:11:53,983	00:11:55,775	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Missy in the making of Roe v Wade
EDL	00:11:55,775	00:12:00,127	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And he's written a lot about Justice Douglas Juvenile Justice Douglas reputation
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,943	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Pulling these Concepts
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:05,759	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Out of the air almost literally out of

EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,295	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Glare
EDL	00:12:07,295	00:12:09,855	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Unfortunately that was par for the course
EDL	00:12:09,855	00:12:10,367	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	With Justice.
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:15,487	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Yeah. You Tatian for being a brilliant legal mind but
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:16,767	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Also kind of a jerk
EDL	00:12:17,279	00:12:19,583	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Not to mention a womanizer and
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:20,863	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Kind of lazy
EDL	00:12:21,631	00:12:24,191	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	His former clerk said his opinions were quote
EDL	00:12:24,191	00:12:25,471	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Drafted in 20 minutes
EDL	00:12:25,471	00:12:26,751	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Easy to ignore
EDL	00:12:26,751	00:12:30,591	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Is another quote here that they were superficial or just plain sloppy like that
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:33,151	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Strong is almost unprecedented
EDL	00:12:33,151	00:12:34,687	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	For a justices

EDL	00:12:36,223	00:12:36,735	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Speak

EDL	00:12:38,271	00:12:39,039	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Highly critical
EDL	00:12:39,807	00:12:40,575	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Of the just
EDL	00:12:41,343	00:12:42,111	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Subsequent
EDL	00:12:42,111	00:12:42,623	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Public
EDL	00:12:46,975	00:12:48,767	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Thanks
EDL	00:12:48,767	00:12:51,071	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Seriously Justice Douglas you can't
EDL	00:12:51,071	00:12:52,863	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Put in a little effort here
EDL	00:12:52,863	00:12:55,167	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I guess another question attached that buddy
EDL	00:12:55,167	00:12:55,935	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Do you kind of
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,727	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Yelled at like does it feel short
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:00,031	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	For example it's been reported
EDL	00:13:00,031	00:13:02,335	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The Justice Clarence Thomas
EDL	00:13:02,335	00:13:03,103	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I had a
EDL	00:13:03,103	00:13:03,871	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Sign in
EDL	00:13:03,871	00:13:06,687	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Is Chambers at the Supreme Court saying

EDL	00:13:16,671	00:13:21,023	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	All that sad when I when I hold all of this in my hands the unenumerated rights
EDL	00:13:21,023	00:13:22,815	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Penumbra the moon all of it
EDL	00:13:23,327	00:13:24,607	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I feel like maybe Douglas
EDL	00:13:24,607	00:13:25,887	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Was destined to fail
EDL	00:13:28,703	00:13:30,239	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Tonight's amendment is different
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:34,847	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I'm like the first eight amendments to outline and incredible detail what Americans should ask
EDL	00:13:35,359	00:13:36,127	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Of their new government
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:43,295	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The 9th Amendment comes floating and without astronomical Vibes gesturing dreamily all the uncontainable
EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:44,319	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Indomitable rights
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:48,415	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	To which Americans can lay claim without ever being able to point them in text
EDL	00:13:49,695	00:13:51,743	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The founders of this country one of the things
EDL	00:13:51,743	00:13:52,767	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	They had in mind
EDL	00:13:53,279	00:13:56,607	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	What's the law wasn't just a set of words or a set of rules
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,143	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The law had a spirit

EDL	00:23:47,968	00:23:50,784	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	To me that the 11th Amendment is hugely
EDL	00:23:51,296	00:23:54,112	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Complicated and difficult to teach even in law schools

EDL	00:24:21,760	00:24:23,296	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Seems maybe like it

EDL	00:24:34,560	00:24:39,680	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I woke up one morning feeling just a little bit queasy and nauseous. Maybe I had eaten something

EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:44,032	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Is an anatomy professor
EDL	00:24:44,032	00:24:46,592	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And she was first introduced to her appendix
EDL	00:24:46,592	00:24:47,872	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	When she was 12 years old
EDL	00:24:48,384	00:24:49,152	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	When it hurts
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:56,320	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Like the discomfort became more and more localized into the lower part of my right abdomen
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:25:01,440	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And by the end of the day that day I was in the emergency room having my appendix removed
EDL	00:25:01,952	00:25:04,256	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	This is how a lot of us encounter the append

EDL	00:25:06,048	00:25:09,120	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And if you look at a picture of the appendix it looks like this
EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:09,888	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Weird
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,936	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Long wart
EDL	00:25:11,936	00:25:12,960	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Coming out of our large
EDL	00:25:13,984	00:25:15,776	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Darwin when he look today
EDL	00:25:15,776	00:25:20,128	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Call the vestigial organ evolutionary remnant
EDL	00:25:20,128	00:25:21,152	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Say something that
EDL	00:25:21,152	00:25:24,480	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Was useful in the past that is no longer useful
EDL	00:25:24,480	00:25:26,784	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Darwin's hypothesis was that
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:29,600	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Nr8 ancestors
EDL	00:25:29,600	00:25:31,136	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	They were much more folivora
EDL	00:25:31,136	00:25:32,928	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Brass meaning that they ate a lot more
EDL	00:25:32,928	00:25:39,328	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Grasses leaves and silver climbing up trees and eating leaves and branches then you just special
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:44,704	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Enzymes and their body to digest that stuff those enzymes were stored in the appendix area
EDL	00:25:45,984	00:25:46,496	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	At least that's what the
EDL	00:25:47,264	00:25:49,056	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	But then over time
EDL	00:25:49,056	00:25:49,568	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Are diet
EDL	00:25:50,080	00:25:51,872	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So his hypothesis was
EDL	00:25:51,872	00:25:54,944	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	That are large intestines essentially shrunk in size
EDL	00:25:55,456	00:25:59,040	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And that when they Shrunk the appendix trunk along with them
EDL	00:25:59,040	00:26:02,112	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So the theory is that now it's just this
EDL	00:26:02,112	00:26:06,208	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Depleted useless organ past its prime that does nothing but
EDL	00:26:06,208	00:26:06,720	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Cod problem
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:12,352	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And for some people it's tempting to see the 11th Amendment in kind of the same way
EDL	00:26:12,352	00:26:14,912	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Where was once the super crucial thing
EDL	00:26:14,912	00:26:15,936	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And now
EDL	00:26:15,936	00:26:16,448	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	It causes pain
EDL	00:26:16,960	00:26:18,496	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Are you saying it was crucial one point
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:20,544	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Yeah actually went why
EDL	00:26:20,544	00:26:21,056	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Well
EDL	00:26:21,568	00:26:23,872	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	You have to remember this amendment was drafted
EDL	00:26:23,872	00:26:25,920	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Originally in 1793
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:32,064	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Bats Bradford Clark a law professor from George Washington University
EDL	00:26:32,576	00:26:33,600	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So only
EDL	00:26:33,600	00:26:35,136	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	4 years after the
EDL	00:26:35,136	00:26:37,440	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Tution was adopted and only 2 years after
EDL	00:26:37,440	00:26:37,952	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The Bill of Rights
EDL	00:26:38,976	00:26:43,328	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Keep in mind the country is a baby at this point like it's a newborn
EDL	00:26:43,840	00:26:48,960	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And so most of the people who wrote the founding document had actually recently
EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:51,264	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Ben British ends in Britain
EDL	00:26:51,264	00:26:56,128	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	There was this idea that you can't sue The King The King has a dignity
EDL	00:26:56,896	00:26:59,712	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	That would be affronted if he were
EDL	00:27:00,224	00:27:02,528	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Dragged into court by a comment
EDL	00:27:03,040	00:27:05,088	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And the founders of the United States
EDL	00:27:05,088	00:27:08,160	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	They took that same idea and put it into the US
EDL	00:27:08,672	00:27:10,976	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Most people took for granted
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:13,792	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	But the federal government would be immune from suit
EDL	00:27:13,792	00:27:15,584	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	But it didn't seem like the states
EDL	00:27:15,584	00:27:16,864	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	We're going to get that seem immunity
EDL	00:27:17,376	00:27:19,168	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And seats were like
EDL	00:27:19,680	00:27:21,216	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	We're not signing on to the concert
EDL	00:27:21,216	00:27:23,008	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Institution if we don't get that immunity
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:26,080	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	B2 maybe it's hard for us in this modern
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:26,848	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	World
EDL	00:27:26,848	00:27:27,872	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	To put ourselves back
EDL	00:27:27,872	00:27:30,176	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Into the mindset of the people
EDL	00:27:30,176	00:27:32,480	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	At the time but I think the states
EDL	00:27:32,480	00:27:33,504	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Burberry
EDL	00:27:34,016	00:27:34,784	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Proud
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:36,064	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Of winning their independence
EDL	00:27:36,576	00:27:38,624	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So in the Declaration of Independence
EDL	00:27:39,136	00:27:40,672	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	They declared themselves
EDL	00:27:40,672	00:27:41,440	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	To be
EDL	00:27:41,440	00:27:42,976	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Free and independent
EDL	00:27:43,488	00:27:44,256	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	States
EDL	00:27:44,256	00:27:46,560	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	We don't think of this today but the word state
EDL	00:27:47,328	00:27:50,144	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	What's the word that was used in international law
EDL	00:27:50,144	00:27:51,168	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	To describe
EDL	00:27:51,168	00:27:52,192	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	A Sovereign Nation
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,752	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And it's still used that way in other countries
EDL	00:27:55,264	00:27:58,080	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And one of the prerogatives of sovereign states
EDL	00:27:58,848	00:28:00,640	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	What's not to be sued
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:03,712	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	In its own courts or in the courts of another sovereign
EDL	00:28:03,712	00:28:04,480	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Without its
EDL	00:28:04,480	00:28:04,992	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Consent
EDL	00:28:05,504	00:28:06,784	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And so that was the basic idea
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:09,344	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Dates were never going to give up immunity
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:12,672	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	They would never sign on to the Constitution without it
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:17,024	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So in some ways the 11th Amendment kind of Saved our concert
EDL	00:28:17,024	00:28:17,536	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Esthetician
EDL	00:28:18,048	00:28:19,328	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The states wouldn't be forced to
EDL	00:28:19,328	00:28:20,096	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The payback.
EDL	00:28:20,096	00:28:21,376	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I thought they were not people
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:23,168	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And because of that
EDL	00:28:23,168	00:28:27,520	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The country could continue to exist until that was very important back then
EDL	00:28:27,520	00:28:29,568	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I don't think we worry about that
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,336	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Very much
EDL	00:28:30,336	00:28:30,848	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Now
EDL	00:28:33,152	00:28:38,784	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	These days according to Suzanna Sherry I think the 11th Amendment is mostly used
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:41,344	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	States from their own illegal act
EDL	00:28:42,624	00:28:44,160	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I don't think that's a good thing
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:48,256	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The 11th Amendment today causes all kinds of
EDL	00:28:48,256	00:28:51,328	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The pain if you happen to have a run-in with
EDL	00:28:51,328	00:28:56,192	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	State the tribe says the lake is part of a watershed sacred to the Coeur d'Alene Indian
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,752	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	But since the Supreme Court
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,520	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The state
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:05,408	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Can't be sued you mean to tell me even if he's Medicaid recipients are right but neener neener neener
EDL	00:29:05,408	00:29:09,248	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I can't sue you and hold you accountable and you're free to violate the law
EDL	00:29:09,248	00:29:13,088	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Florida refuse to negotiate with the Seminole tribe
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,880	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	And so the Seminole tribe trade
EDL	00:29:14,880	00:29:15,904	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Sue them in federal court
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:17,440	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Springport said nope
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:21,280	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I feel that the people that will hurt from
EDL	00:29:21,280	00:29:26,656	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Smoking cigarettes should be compensated for it will be difficult
EDL	00:29:26,656	00:29:28,192	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Because the 11th Amendment
EDL	00:29:28,192	00:29:31,264	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Protect States from federal lawsuits for monetary damage
EDL	00:29:31,264	00:29:33,568	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	This is why the 11th Amendment is soaked
EDL	00:29:34,336	00:29:40,736	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Let me see think like should we just get rid of the 11th Amendment like should we be going full appendectomy
EDL	00:29:40,736	00:29:42,016	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Well
EDL	00:29:42,016	00:29:42,528	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I think
EDL	00:29:43,040	00:29:45,600	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	I think that might be a pretty good metaphor
EDL	00:29:45,600	00:29:46,880	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Stop it. There is a
EDL	00:29:47,392	00:29:49,184	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Butte it's as if they're word
EDL	00:29:49,184	00:29:50,208	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Dispute among
EDL	00:29:50,976	00:29:51,744	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Doctors
EDL	00:29:51,744	00:29:54,816	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	About whether the appendix was actually a useful or
EDL	00:29:54,816	00:30:00,960	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Yes there is there absolutely is. Oh I didn't know that they've just come out with a study that says
EDL	00:30:01,472	00:30:02,240	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Actually
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:03,520	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The appendix
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,568	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Might be useful
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:11,968	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So like when there's a time of turmoil in the stomach as they caught like a diarrheal episode
EDL	00:30:11,968	00:30:15,552	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	What to use that on the podcast
EDL	00:30:16,064	00:30:17,088	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Watch me
EDL	00:30:17,088	00:30:19,392	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So I just want to kind of like walk
EDL	00:30:19,392	00:30:20,672	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	2 Step by Step
EDL	00:30:20,672	00:30:24,768	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	A diarrheal episode
EDL	00:30:25,280	00:30:31,680	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Heather Smith again is one of the people who discovered this so let's say for instance you had a tourist who went to
EDL	00:30:31,680	00:30:33,472	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Another country and got some kind of serious
EDL	00:30:33,984	00:30:35,520	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Gastrointestinal
EDL	00:30:35,520	00:30:36,544	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Issue and they had
EDL	00:30:37,056	00:30:39,360	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Episodes of diarrhea when your body
EDL	00:30:39,360	00:30:40,896	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Flushing everything out
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:43,456	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The appendix actually has this kind of
EDL	00:30:43,456	00:30:43,968	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	What a
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:46,016	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Beautiful function
EDL	00:30:46,016	00:30:49,088	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The appendix may serve as a safe house
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:52,160	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Bund of a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria
EDL	00:30:52,672	00:30:54,720	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	So maybe the appendix
EDL	00:30:54,720	00:30:56,768	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Isn't vestigial like Darwin
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:31:01,632	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	The term that we use in an evolutionary biology is called an ex app
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:02,400	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Patient
EDL	00:31:02,400	00:31:03,680	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Though it's where
EDL	00:31:03,680	00:31:05,216	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	A structure
EDL	00:31:05,216	00:31:08,544	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Serves an Adaptive function but it's not its original
EDL	00:31:08,544	00:31:14,432	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Function in the same way the 11th amendments day looks very different than it did in 1790
EDL	00:31:15,712	00:31:17,504	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	That's because the Supreme Court
EDL	00:31:18,016	00:31:18,528	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Bandit
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:22,368	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Is that the 11th means a lot more than it says
EDL	00:31:22,880	00:31:23,648	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	It protects
EDL	00:31:23,648	00:31:24,928	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Against
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:25,952	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	All kinds of suits
EDL	00:31:26,720	00:31:28,000	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Of course there are exceptions
EDL	00:31:28,512	00:31:32,352	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	But it means a lot of times a Floridian can't sue Florida for damages
EDL	00:31:33,120	00:31:35,424	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	It also might mean you can't sue a state that's
EDL	00:31:35,424	00:31:37,216	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Choosing to be a sanctuary for immigrants
EDL	00:31:38,496	00:31:39,520	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Depending on who you are
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:40,800	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	You might need that
EDL	00:31:41,568	00:31:43,360	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	Or you might see it as a good thing
EDL	00:31:44,384	00:31:45,408	| moreperfect100218_themostperfectalbumepisode3 |	A reservoir
