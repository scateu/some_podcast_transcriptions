EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:54,592	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	How did you become interested in this since you know I've been working and you know fiction and then other kind of town
EDL	00:02:54,592	00:03:00,992	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Actually I was reading Scott Burns biography on Wilson and had a really interesting line where he said we'll see
EDL	00:03:00,992	00:03:02,016	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	She was almost the president
EDL	00:03:02,784	00:03:03,808	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Almost a president
EDL	00:03:04,320	00:03:07,136	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Wilson by the way is Woodrow Wilson
EDL	00:03:07,136	00:03:10,208	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	20th president United States 1913 to 1921
EDL	00:03:10,208	00:03:12,512	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Is she being referred to here
EDL	00:03:12,512	00:03:14,048	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Is his wife Edith
EDL	00:03:14,048	00:03:14,560	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And I thought
EDL	00:03:15,072	00:03:16,352	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Almost a president
EDL	00:03:16,352	00:03:19,936	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	So I started a little research and what I found out was that
EDL	00:03:19,936	00:03:22,240	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	He was totally incapacitated
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,776	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	From a stroke in 1990
EDL	00:03:24,544	00:03:27,616	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And that she has second wife only 42 years old
EDL	00:03:27,616	00:03:28,640	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Took over and
EDL	00:03:28,640	00:03:30,688	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Absolutely was the first woman president
EDL	00:03:32,736	00:03:35,552	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	So why don't we start with just like some kind of biographic
EDL	00:03:35,552	00:03:38,368	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	You know how did they meet okay okay

EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:50,400	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Kidney disease a lot of women died of at that time
EDL	00:03:50,400	00:03:54,496	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	This is 1915 by the way and his first wife is only 54 when she died
EDL	00:03:57,056	00:04:02,176	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And I actually want to resign the presidency
EDL	00:04:02,688	00:04:06,784	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And Doctor Grayson who was his personal physician said me and let's go for a drive
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,600	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	He just wanted to get him out of the White House

EDL	00:14:30,399	00:14:33,215	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And that's the moment earlier an inauguration
EDL	00:14:33,727	00:14:35,007	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	What about vice-president Marsh
EDL	00:14:36,287	00:14:37,055	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	No

EDL	00:15:08,287	00:15:08,799	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	The perfect solution
EDL	00:15:09,311	00:15:10,591	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Well because of this

EDL	00:15:25,439	00:15:26,207	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And

EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:28,767	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	You know what he could recover
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:30,047	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	So they can

EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,831	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	What happens when she assumes
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:57,343	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	The presidency
EDL	00:17:00,415	00:17:03,231	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Do you set up a desk outside the presidential bedroom
EDL	00:17:03,231	00:17:06,303	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And she wouldn't eat cabinet members and everybody else there

EDL	00:17:12,703	00:17:15,263	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And Welfare and get his take on a if he could talk
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:19,103	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Otherwise she would just write on there the president can't deal with this
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:24,223	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	In day-to-day running Wilson cannot participate so Edith

EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:31,903	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Young people who had to be ambassador
EDL	00:17:31,903	00:17:33,951	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	In fact she would get laundry list

EDL	00:32:13,568	00:32:14,848	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	We drive a car
EDL	00:32:14,848	00:32:19,456	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	When we go in to apply for a license we can choose whether or not we want to be an organ donor or not
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:21,248	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	To the basic point is
EDL	00:32:21,248	00:32:22,016	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	If you
EDL	00:32:22,528	00:32:25,344	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Process to pay taxes you trust us to drive
EDL	00:32:25,344	00:32:28,928	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	You trust us to be part of the decision to donate an organ
EDL	00:32:28,928	00:32:30,464	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Then you should trust us to vote
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,024	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	But here's the thing right
EDL	00:32:35,840	00:32:37,632	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	When I went out
EDL	00:32:37,632	00:32:38,656	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	On Election Day
EDL	00:32:39,168	00:32:44,032	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	To ask people do you think 16 year olds should be able to vote if they thought this was a good idea
EDL	00:32:45,568	00:32:47,360	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Most of them were like
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,640	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Now
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:54,272	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	No I don't think so I don't think so
EDL	00:32:54,272	00:32:58,112	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Absolutely not that's around the time I get in the marijuana their judgment is off now
EDL	00:32:58,880	00:33:00,416	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Is that a thing that people are talking
EDL	00:33:00,416	00:33:06,560	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	I even had a 16 year old tell me that 16 year olds shouldn't vote
EDL	00:33:08,096	00:33:12,192	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And ask her why most people that I talk to you like that guy
EDL	00:33:12,192	00:33:14,496	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	They just had this gut feeling that
EDL	00:33:15,264	00:33:16,288	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	16 is
EDL	00:33:16,288	00:33:19,104	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Really different from 18
EDL	00:33:19,104	00:33:25,504	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Is 16 is not a certain things that are wrong with that age might not be informed about these issues
EDL	00:33:25,504	00:33:27,808	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	I mean I'm thinking of my kids when they were 16
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,344	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	People
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:31,648	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Constantly are coming up to me after event
EDL	00:33:31,648	00:33:34,720	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	They look at me and they say I like like I trust you more devoted
EDL	00:33:35,232	00:33:36,000	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	You know I
EDL	00:33:36,000	00:33:37,024	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Trust you to make out more info
EDL	00:33:37,024	00:33:37,536	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Decision
EDL	00:33:38,048	00:33:39,072	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	I trust myself
EDL	00:33:39,840	00:33:40,608	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	But
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:41,632	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	What about the other
EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:42,400	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	What about the others
EDL	00:33:43,680	00:33:47,008	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Yeah just looking at social media for have some gives you
EDL	00:33:47,520	00:33:49,568	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Previous answer that kind of 16 year olds
EDL	00:33:50,592	00:33:55,456	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Now to be fair just wondering if I could ask you a quick question
EDL	00:33:55,968	00:34:02,368	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Somebody did think differently do you think 16 year olds should be able to vote
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:03,392	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	No thought into
EDL	00:34:03,392	00:34:04,416	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Weirdly enough that's
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:07,232	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Seth Meyers of late night talk show hosts
EDL	00:34:07,744	00:34:12,096	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	He was Voting right where I happened to be gathering tape
EDL	00:34:12,096	00:34:16,704	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	What's the weather like got reaction reaction is you could let 16 year olds vote
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:17,984	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And we wouldn't be any worse off
EDL	00:34:17,984	00:34:20,800	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	You know you're like the only person who said that
EDL	00:34:20,800	00:34:22,336	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Yeah I believe
EDL	00:34:23,360	00:34:25,408	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	I don't know. Now I'm starting to doubt my answer
EDL	00:34:25,408	00:34:28,992	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Stand by you
EDL	00:34:30,528	00:34:36,416	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And as the day wore on I actually did encounter more people who felt like maybe it's different now
EDL	00:34:36,416	00:34:39,744	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	All the musicians are listening to you are also talking about politics
EDL	00:34:39,744	00:34:40,512	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	MTV Has Fallen
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:44,352	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	So maybe there more were maybe 16 today is
EDL	00:34:44,352	00:34:48,704	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Different from 16 back in the day
EDL	00:34:48,704	00:34:52,544	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Strong opinion but you know what gun violence going on they probably do
EDL	00:34:52,544	00:34:55,616	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Yeah today's most 16 year olds are mature enough
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:57,408	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Understand what's going on at the light
EDL	00:34:58,176	00:35:02,272	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Now from a psychological perspective the time people are sick
EDL	00:35:02,272	00:35:05,088	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	16 their abilities to make
EDL	00:35:05,088	00:35:09,184	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Thoughtful deliberate decisions to consult with x
EDL	00:35:09,184	00:35:11,232	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Experts when they wanted advice that those
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:13,280	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Those abilities by the time people are sick
EDL	00:35:13,280	00:35:14,304	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	15 or no
EDL	00:35:14,304	00:35:16,352	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Worse than the abilities of adults
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:20,192	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	That's Laurence Steinberg professor of psychology at Temple University
EDL	00:35:20,192	00:35:21,216	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	He says that
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:23,520	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	The research out there seems to suggest that
EDL	00:35:24,032	00:35:25,312	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Cognitively
EDL	00:35:25,312	00:35:29,408	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	The average 16 year old Isn't that different from the average 18 year old
EDL	00:35:29,920	00:35:32,224	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	They're both equally likely to make bad decision
EDL	00:35:33,504	00:35:35,040	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	It almost sounds like
EDL	00:35:35,040	00:35:36,064	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	It's not that
EDL	00:35:36,064	00:35:36,832	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Adult
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:38,368	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Are smarter than two
EDL	00:35:38,368	00:35:39,136	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	16 year olds
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:40,160	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	It's that
EDL	00:35:40,672	00:35:42,464	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	16 year olds are just as stupid as
EDL	00:35:43,744	00:35:46,304	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	I guess you could look at it that way or let's just say
EDL	00:35:46,304	00:35:48,352	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	That the proportion of 16 year olds
EDL	00:35:48,864	00:35:49,632	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Who are stupid
EDL	00:35:50,144	00:35:52,704	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Is no greater than the proportion of adults
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:53,216	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Who are stupid
EDL	00:35:53,728	00:35:55,776	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	If that's the case and
EDL	00:35:55,776	00:36:02,176	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	It really is true that the average 16 year old today is more politically aware than
EDL	00:36:02,176	00:36:04,224	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	16 year olds in the past then
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:07,808	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	It really is hard to think of a reason
EDL	00:36:07,808	00:36:09,088	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Why
EDL	00:36:09,088	00:36:10,624	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	They shouldn't have the ability to vote
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:17,536	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	You know right now 16 17 year olds and up me personally I have nothing that a politician
EDL	00:36:17,536	00:36:18,304	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Once
EDL	00:36:18,304	00:36:19,328	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	You lower the voting age to
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:21,888	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	Teen they actually come to us
EDL	00:36:21,888	00:36:22,912	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And they're going to ask
EDL	00:36:22,912	00:36:23,936	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	They start to care about
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:28,544	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	When I spoke to Alex
EDL	00:36:28,544	00:36:30,848	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	The vote in the DC Council
EDL	00:36:30,848	00:36:32,384	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	What's a couple months away
EDL	00:36:32,384	00:36:34,432	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	He was super optimistic
EDL	00:36:34,432	00:36:37,760	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	That the bill had the votes that are needed in order to pass
EDL	00:36:38,272	00:36:40,832	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	And that it would become the law of our nation's capital
EDL	00:36:41,600	00:36:42,624	| moreperfect112118_themostperfectalbumep7 |	If the stars pass
