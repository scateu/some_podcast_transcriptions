EDL	00:07:18,783	00:07:22,879	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	At Northwestern pritzker School of Law
EDL	00:07:22,879	00:07:25,439	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	And the case itself doesn't really matter for our purposes
EDL	00:07:25,951	00:07:29,023	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	What matters is the rhythm of the conversation
EDL	00:07:29,023	00:07:29,791	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Neptune
EDL	00:07:29,791	00:07:30,303	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	To test
EDL	00:07:30,815	00:07:31,583	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Strict scrutiny
EDL	00:07:31,583	00:07:34,399	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	You have the lawyer but Ryan making his case
EDL	00:07:34,399	00:07:39,007	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	The traffic and then you
EDL	00:07:39,519	00:07:43,871	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Because the clutch is supposed to raise it on its own in this case Ruth Bader Ginsburg
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:45,407	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	I'm sitting there listening
EDL	00:07:45,407	00:07:51,807	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Dylan doesn't think much of this particular moment because he knows from his Professor I'm Tanya Jacoby I am a professor of

EDL	00:07:53,087	00:07:55,903	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Pritzker school of law that interruptions are just
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:58,719	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Part of the deal the justices do interrupt The Advocate
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,743	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Constantly the.
EDL	00:07:59,743	00:08:00,255	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Suffix
EDL	00:08:00,767	00:08:02,303	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	The rule is that the justice
EDL	00:08:02,303	00:08:03,327	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	This is our loud
EDL	00:08:03,327	00:08:04,095	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	To interrupt
EDL	00:08:04,095	00:08:04,863	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	The blow lead lawyer
EDL	00:08:05,375	00:08:09,215	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	But not the other way around there is this rule that says
EDL	00:08:09,215	00:08:13,311	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Directly if a Justice begins talking you as The Advocate
EDL	00:08:13,311	00:08:16,127	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Cease talking immediately lawyers are not allowed
EDL	00:08:16,639	00:08:17,151	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	To interrupt
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:18,687	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Which is why
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:20,223	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	I was listening
EDL	00:08:20,735	00:08:24,575	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	This other moment really cut his ear
EDL	00:08:25,343	00:08:31,743	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	It's a moment where the lawyer Burt Ryan is talking
EDL	00:08:31,743	00:08:33,791	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Am I your steps in

EDL	00:08:42,495	00:08:44,287	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Get away from them

EDL	00:08:46,335	00:08:48,383	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Start to kind of bicker
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:51,967	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	And Justice Sotomayor are essentially having an argument amongst
EDL	00:08:51,967	00:08:54,015	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Styles going back and forth back and forth
EDL	00:08:54,015	00:08:55,039	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Virtually

EDL	00:09:06,303	00:09:07,327	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	So much so
EDL	00:09:07,327	00:09:07,839	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Vet
EDL	00:09:08,351	00:09:12,191	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Justice Sotomayor said let me finish my point
EDL	00:09:16,287	00:09:17,567	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Say let me finish my point
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:18,847	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	That is a
EDL	00:09:19,359	00:09:21,151	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	That to me was very striking
EDL	00:09:21,151	00:09:21,663	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	He's right
EDL	00:09:22,431	00:09:23,199	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	For their edges
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:25,759	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Chelsea's a subordinate walking into their house
EDL	00:09:25,759	00:09:27,295	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	He's like that's against the rules
EDL	00:09:28,063	00:09:29,087	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	It keeps listening
EDL	00:09:29,599	00:09:31,647	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	They start to notice that this moment
EDL	00:09:32,159	00:09:33,439	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Kind of keeps happening
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:37,791	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Does a critical mass
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:42,143	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Again and again the female justices just keep getting interrupted
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:42,655	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	And I just
EDL	00:09:43,167	00:09:48,799	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	I could not believe the amount of times it happened I'm I remember I opened up a word doc and I wrote
EDL	00:09:48,799	00:09:50,591	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	And said term paper idea
EDL	00:09:51,103	00:09:57,247	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Men interrupting women on the Supreme Court
EDL	00:09:58,271	00:10:00,831	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	At this point my ladies in the house might be thinking
EDL	00:10:02,111	00:10:04,927	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Okay Dillon
EDL	00:10:04,927	00:10:06,975	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Gambling is going on in here
EDL	00:10:07,487	00:10:12,607	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Real shocker my fiance about this I think she would describe the whole thing as ironic
EDL	00:10:12,607	00:10:18,495	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	So I'll let you know I mean the skull is from linguist
EDL	00:10:18,495	00:10:23,359	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Two psychologists of showing that women get interrupted
EDL	00:10:23,359	00:10:29,503	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	In pretty much every forum
EDL	00:10:31,039	00:10:35,903	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	What's so striking about a DS
EDL	00:10:35,903	00:10:36,927	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Is that
EDL	00:10:36,927	00:10:37,439	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Health information
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:38,719	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Oh I'm sorry that I
EDL	00:10:41,791	00:10:45,887	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Yeah so men interrupting women not exactly front-page news but
EDL	00:10:45,887	00:10:51,519	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	No one had ever done a systematic quantifying of this phenomenon on the Supreme Court
EDL	00:10:53,055	00:10:55,871	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	So what you decided to do was
EDL	00:10:55,871	00:11:02,271	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	A call the audio from Supreme Court years 2004 to 2015
EDL	00:11:02,271	00:11:03,039	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Into the computer
EDL	00:11:04,063	00:11:06,111	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	This is hundreds of thousands words
EDL	00:11:07,391	00:11:13,791	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Into the computer word transcripts not actual audio but whatever and they did hand code a few additional years including one
EDL	00:11:13,791	00:11:15,327	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Sandra Day O'Connor was on the court
EDL	00:11:15,327	00:11:18,143	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	But to identify the actual Interruption points
EDL	00:11:18,655	00:11:20,447	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	How to computer look for dashes
EDL	00:11:20,959	00:11:23,775	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Every time anyone gets interrupted on the Supreme Court
EDL	00:11:23,775	00:11:26,591	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Two little dashes pop-up in the transcript
EDL	00:11:26,591	00:11:29,663	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	So Tanya and Dylan create an algorithm
EDL	00:11:29,663	00:11:31,199	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	That would be able to count
EDL	00:11:31,199	00:11:32,479	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	The dashes that were interruption
EDL	00:11:39,903	00:11:41,695	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Let me guess let me guess meme
EDL	00:11:42,207	00:11:45,279	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	The female justices were interrupted the the most number
EDL	00:11:46,303	00:11:47,839	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Well technically no
EDL	00:11:48,351	00:11:49,631	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Really the most
EDL	00:11:49,631	00:11:52,703	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Number of interruptions actually happened between two men
EDL	00:11:52,703	00:11:54,495	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Scalia and
EDL	00:11:54,495	00:11:57,567	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Did not get along
EDL	00:11:57,567	00:11:58,335	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	General bases
EDL	00:11:58,335	00:12:00,127	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Except
EDL	00:12:00,639	00:12:02,175	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Houston
EDL	00:12:02,175	00:12:03,967	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	The state
EDL	00:12:03,967	00:12:04,735	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Justice League
EDL	00:12:04,735	00:12:07,551	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Portuguese
EDL	00:12:07,551	00:12:12,159	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Justice Scalia who died last year than conservative brierley liberal
EDL	00:12:12,159	00:12:14,975	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	He spent about 21 years on the court together
EDL	00:12:14,975	00:12:18,303	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	During that time they were constantly up in each other's
EDL	00:12:18,303	00:12:20,095	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	And
EDL	00:12:20,095	00:12:25,727	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Justice Scalia interrupted Justice Breyer four times more often than any other individual Justice
EDL	00:12:25,727	00:12:29,567	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Except for Justice Breyer who was interrupting Justice Scalia has twice as much
EDL	00:12:31,103	00:12:34,687	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Rosso ideology transgender that's kind of don't know
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:36,735	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Hopeful no no no
EDL	00:12:37,247	00:12:40,319	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Because that's fat between Breyer and Scalia
EDL	00:12:41,087	00:12:44,159	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	It's really an operation even though these two men were
EDL	00:12:44,159	00:12:45,439	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	We interrupt each other
EDL	00:12:45,439	00:12:46,207	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Inovalon
EDL	00:12:46,207	00:12:48,511	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	We still managed to find a very large Ginger fact
EDL	00:12:49,791	00:12:54,655	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	So when they compiled all of the interruptions together
EDL	00:12:55,935	00:12:57,215	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	+ reaching back
EDL	00:12:57,215	00:12:59,519	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Toq years when Sandra Day O'Connor was on the court
EDL	00:13:00,543	00:13:04,383	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	They looked at how many interruptions were happening to the female dresses
EDL	00:13:04,383	00:13:06,943	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	It's versus the men the women are Interrupted about
EDL	00:13:06,943	00:13:11,807	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	3 times as much as the average man
EDL	00:13:12,831	00:13:13,855	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Three times as much
EDL	00:13:15,391	00:13:15,903	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	1%
EDL	00:13:20,767	00:13:21,279	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Tus temperature
EDL	00:13:21,791	00:13:25,887	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	I simply waited with an expectation that we would see that patent
EDL	00:13:26,399	00:13:30,239	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	But I think that what's really surprising is that our impression that the
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,007	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	The Advocate
EDL	00:13:31,007	00:13:31,775	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	We interrupting the just
EDL	00:13:32,287	00:13:33,567	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	And that that was gendered
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:36,639	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Meaning the male lawyers the lowly lawyers
EDL	00:13:37,407	00:13:39,711	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Even they felt they could interrupt the female dress
EDL	00:13:40,479	00:13:41,759	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	But that was shown to be
EDL	00:13:41,759	00:13:42,527	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Systemic
EDL	00:13:42,527	00:13:44,319	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Was really shocking because
EDL	00:13:44,831	00:13:46,367	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Speech patterns
EDL	00:13:46,367	00:13:49,439	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Like interruptions are a product of dominance
EDL	00:13:49,951	00:13:51,999	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	And so men interrupt a lot
EDL	00:13:51,999	00:13:52,767	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Because they have
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,815	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Traditionally been dominant within Society
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:57,887	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	But that means that if a woman is an imposition of
EDL	00:13:57,887	00:14:03,007	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Clearly demarcated higher power than the man then the man should not be interrupting the woman
EDL	00:14:03,775	00:14:09,151	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	And in terms of the justices interrupting each other was there one master interrupter
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:11,199	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Yes in fact absolutely
EDL	00:14:14,271	00:14:16,319	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	See if you can guess who that is
EDL	00:14:16,319	00:14:17,599	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Interrupting RBG
EDL	00:14:20,159	00:14:21,951	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	He is the Swing Vote
EDL	00:14:21,951	00:14:25,279	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Considered by some to be the most powerful man in America
EDL	00:14:25,279	00:14:26,047	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Justice Kennedy
EDL	00:14:28,095	00:14:29,119	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Hands down

EDL	00:14:42,431	00:14:43,711	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Which is
EDL	00:14:43,711	00:14:50,111	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Rude but maybe not wrong he was number one and then he was followed by Justice Scalia and
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:51,135	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Chief justice rehnquist

EDL	00:14:57,535	00:14:59,583	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Justice Ginsburg

EDL	00:15:27,487	00:15:29,279	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Scalise's question and I think
EDL	00:15:29,279	00:15:31,327	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Rochester Turner's asking to
EDL	00:15:31,327	00:15:33,375	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Justice Kennedy chimes in and says

EDL	00:19:15,839	00:19:16,607	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	2 points
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,423	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Take the case of Sonia Sotomayor

EDL	00:20:30,591	00:20:31,615	| moreperfect_extras121917_justiceinterrupted |	Maybe the most
