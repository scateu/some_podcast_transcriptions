EDL	00:02:06,464	00:02:12,608	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	There's an execution tonight and we just found out that the lethal injection drugs that they're going to use
EDL	00:02:13,120	00:02:13,888	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	It came from a
EDL	00:02:13,888	00:02:15,168	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Pharmacy in England
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:19,776	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But we don't know which pharmacy because Arizona refuses to release
EDL	00:02:19,776	00:02:24,640	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Is the name does anyone in the office have some time alone to have some time to figure out whether stocks could have come
EDL	00:02:25,152	00:02:27,712	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	She raises her hand and she's like I have 30 minutes you know
EDL	00:02:29,760	00:02:30,528	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I didn't know
EDL	00:02:31,040	00:02:32,576	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	What I was talking when I stopped
EDL	00:02:32,576	00:02:34,112	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I want to find this
EDL	00:02:34,112	00:02:35,648	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Supplier like why does it help them
EDL	00:02:35,648	00:02:38,208	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	What the drugs did they want to use an Arizona hat
EDL	00:02:38,208	00:02:38,720	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	To be updated
EDL	00:02:39,488	00:02:44,096	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So they can find who made these drugs and prove that they are not FDA-approved and they can
EDL	00:02:44,096	00:02:45,120	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Probably stop the X
EDL	00:02:45,120	00:02:48,192	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Do they have any reason to think the drugs were it FDA approved
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,728	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Is kind of a Hail Mary
EDL	00:02:49,728	00:02:50,752	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Also
EDL	00:02:50,752	00:02:55,872	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I started the half-hour research tasks that is taking me now five and a half years
EDL	00:02:55,872	00:02:57,664	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I was trying to figure out with
EDL	00:02:58,176	00:03:03,040	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Limited information where sodium thiopental could have come from in the UK to get
EDL	00:03:03,040	00:03:08,672	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	U.s. sodium thiopental is an anesthetic and for a long time it was one of the most common anesthetics used
EDL	00:03:08,672	00:03:12,768	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In surgeries but it's also one of the drugs used in lethal injection
EDL	00:03:12,768	00:03:14,048	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I was so
EDL	00:03:15,584	00:03:16,864	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I didn't think I knew
EDL	00:03:17,376	00:03:20,192	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The puppets full reset that I didn't but I was doing it very quickly
EDL	00:03:20,960	00:03:22,240	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Because of course they have
EDL	00:03:22,240	00:03:23,520	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Houston at night
EDL	00:03:23,520	00:03:25,056	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Is running out of time
EDL	00:03:25,568	00:03:26,080	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And option
EDL	00:03:27,104	00:03:31,712	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I was in the UK so it's the evening morning Arizona time.
EDL	00:03:31,712	00:03:33,248	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Number of algal species
EDL	00:03:33,248	00:03:35,040	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Frantically searching
EDL	00:03:35,040	00:03:36,832	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Medical regulations
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:41,952	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And you know she can't figure out exactly what the name of the company is there's no way to know at that point
EDL	00:03:41,952	00:03:45,280	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But ultimately she does figure out that there are no
EDL	00:03:45,280	00:03:46,560	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	UK companies
EDL	00:03:47,072	00:03:49,120	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Authorized to ship this drug to the US
EDL	00:03:49,120	00:03:50,144	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	That was no
EDL	00:03:50,144	00:03:52,960	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Effectively no FDA approved supplier of the star
EDL	00:03:53,472	00:03:57,824	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Suit whatever this mystery Pharmacy was it probably wasn't FDA-approved
EDL	00:03:57,824	00:03:58,592	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And I remember
EDL	00:03:59,104	00:04:03,456	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And I emailed that over I think we had the time to intern affidavit from meal from fly
EDL	00:04:03,456	00:04:07,552	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	They write up a quick affidavit they send it back to the states and
EDL	00:04:07,552	00:04:09,856	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The execution that night was
EDL	00:04:09,856	00:04:10,368	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Stayed

EDL	00:04:11,648	00:04:13,952	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	When I went to sleep and having stayed and I just thought I'd

EDL	00:05:06,431	00:05:09,759	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Was not FDA-approved but the US Supreme Court did rule
EDL	00:05:09,759	00:05:10,783	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	That there was no reason
EDL	00:05:13,343	00:05:15,391	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Not talk about a rude awakening

EDL	00:06:36,287	00:06:37,823	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The drugs that they use
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:44,223	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The lethal drug sodium thiopental is suddenly in really short supply
EDL	00:06:44,223	00:06:48,575	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Is the only us company that still made that drug with housing
EDL	00:06:48,575	00:06:51,647	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Leica manufacturing problem so they have stopped manufacturing
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:58,047	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Producing the strad so you actually see these emails between states like do do you have any sodium thiopental

EDL	00:07:29,279	00:07:31,071	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And this is how they end up at
EDL	00:07:31,071	00:07:32,607	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	This mystery Drug Company in London
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:41,823	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So after the execution my is doing all this research she's calling Pharma company on to these documents and
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:48,223	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Very quickly she learns that the same company that is sending drugs to Arizona at 10 drugs till I can buy lots of different states
EDL	00:07:48,223	00:07:51,807	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	South Carolina Kentucky and dryers at the places
EDL	00:07:52,319	00:07:56,671	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	They actually become one of the primary suppliers that we've won Jackson Drugs to the United States
EDL	00:07:56,671	00:07:59,999	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Why was it so hard to find out information about this company
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:04,607	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So what happens is that anybody involved with an execution your name is kept confidential
EDL	00:08:05,119	00:08:06,655	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And states have started keeping
EDL	00:08:06,655	00:08:08,447	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Companies names confidential to
EDL	00:08:08,447	00:08:08,959	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	IC
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:14,079	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So the next few starts calling suppliers and Distributors kind of trying to trace
EDL	00:08:14,079	00:08:17,919	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Like how did this drug get to that company thinking that maybe that'll lead her to it
EDL	00:08:17,919	00:08:19,199	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	We had figured out
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:19,967	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	It had
EDL	00:08:19,967	00:08:22,015	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Come originally
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:22,527	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	From

EDL	00:08:25,855	00:08:26,879	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Some of those with

EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:34,815	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The package put into files those were sent over to the UK that was one company that had got the Moxie with vibration
EDL	00:08:34,815	00:08:38,143	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Sold their soul to another one that company chasing men
EDL	00:08:38,143	00:08:39,679	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	They were sent to
EDL	00:08:39,679	00:08:41,471	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Best company in England
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:43,775	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	What she still can't figure out the identity of
EDL	00:08:44,287	00:08:46,591	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But then the real breakthrough came just
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,383	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Couple months after Jeffrey landrigan was
EDL	00:08:49,151	00:08:55,551	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I think it was a lot of material coming out of that time I'm going to California and the ACLU got a bunch of documents and in one
EDL	00:08:55,551	00:08:57,087	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	One of these batches of documents

EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,391	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And this invoice

EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:11,679	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Opposed to the death penalty and luckily for him this would just happen
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:18,847	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional today
EDL	00:17:18,847	00:17:23,711	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Miles across the country in 1972 the Supreme Court actually abolished the death penalty
EDL	00:17:23,711	00:17:26,527	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Cuz they said it was being applied unfairly or
EDL	00:17:26,527	00:17:27,039	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Haphazard
EDL	00:17:27,551	00:17:29,599	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In a way that could only be called

EDL	00:17:48,799	00:17:55,199	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Very much in favor and favor of it we get some Law & Order into this country.
EDL	00:17:55,199	00:17:58,783	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I don't think you should have taken away in the first place in almost immediately 35 States
EDL	00:17:58,783	00:18:02,879	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Rewrite their death penalty laws essentially saying like no no we can do this right
EDL	00:18:02,879	00:18:04,671	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And in 1976
EDL	00:18:04,671	00:18:05,695	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Supreme Court says
EDL	00:18:05,695	00:18:06,463	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	All right
EDL	00:18:06,463	00:18:10,047	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	If you can administer the death penalty fairly and humanely
EDL	00:18:10,047	00:18:10,559	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	You can have it back
EDL	00:18:12,607	00:18:17,215	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So 9072a death penalty abolished 1976 it's reinstated
EDL	00:18:17,215	00:18:19,775	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Bill Wiseman get selected smack-dab in the middle of this
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:22,079	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	You know 1976
EDL	00:18:22,079	00:18:22,847	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Suddenly
EDL	00:18:22,847	00:18:27,967	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	There's a bill in Oklahoma State Legislature about whether to reinstate the death penalty and bilhah
EDL	00:18:27,967	00:18:28,479	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The vote on that
EDL	00:18:29,247	00:18:30,015	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I know
EDL	00:18:31,039	00:18:31,807	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The capital punishment
EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:34,111	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Interested it doesn't work doesn't
EDL	00:18:35,647	00:18:37,439	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And I couldn't see any way to justify
EDL	00:18:37,439	00:18:38,719	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I also knew
EDL	00:18:39,231	00:18:41,791	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Then if I'd voted against it from my district
EDL	00:18:42,303	00:18:42,815	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I would
EDL	00:18:43,327	00:18:44,607	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Run a high chance
EDL	00:18:44,607	00:18:45,375	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Getting whooped
EDL	00:18:46,143	00:18:49,215	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Cuz 80% of his constituents were in favor of the death penalty
EDL	00:18:50,239	00:18:51,775	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	After all that wondering
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:54,079	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Honey, this job that you love
EDL	00:18:54,079	00:18:57,407	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Having the best time and I didn't want to get whooped so I was
EDL	00:18:57,407	00:18:58,431	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In a real dilemma
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:18:59,711	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	What you do
EDL	00:19:01,247	00:19:02,015	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The wrong thing
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:05,087	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Devoted to reinstate the death penalty
EDL	00:19:05,087	00:19:06,367	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	For whatever reason
EDL	00:19:06,879	00:19:12,767	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Of ego or vanity or need or the motivation to get reelected whatever the reasons
EDL	00:19:13,279	00:19:14,559	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I knowingly made it
EDL	00:19:15,327	00:19:16,095	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	A decision
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:17,887	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	When I know is wrong
EDL	00:19:25,311	00:19:28,895	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Susan the legislature and he's feeling like he just sold his soul
EDL	00:19:28,895	00:19:35,295	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And as they're debating various amendments to this law someone brings up something sort of vaguely about a more humane
EDL	00:19:35,295	00:19:38,367	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Mean way to execute people and he's like that yes.
EDL	00:19:38,367	00:19:42,719	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And he becomes obsessed with this idea I was like a way to assuage his guilt
EDL	00:19:42,719	00:19:48,863	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Yeah so he brings up some anesthesiologist and doctors and says I want to find a better way to do this and they say we can't help you cuz
EDL	00:19:49,887	00:19:51,423	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The credit goes to no harm.
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:56,031	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Did a little bit of arms 3 goes to the State medical examiner a guy named Jay Chapman
EDL	00:19:56,031	00:20:00,895	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And Jay just sort of like freestyles has one line that that bill
EDL	00:20:00,895	00:20:04,991	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Literally just sits with a yellow legal pad and rights word for word

EDL	00:20:17,279	00:20:22,655	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The idea is that these three drugs would allow them to execute people but but painlessly
EDL	00:20:23,679	00:20:26,495	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And right there in that office with just like

EDL	00:20:44,671	00:20:48,255	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Ground and the idea that we could we could do this right
EDL	00:20:48,255	00:20:51,327	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And what bill has just handed America

EDL	00:21:03,103	00:21:05,407	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Texas does and then dozens of states and
EDL	00:21:05,407	00:21:06,431	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Since that moment
EDL	00:21:06,943	00:21:08,735	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	88% of all executions
EDL	00:21:10,015	00:21:10,783	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Injection
EDL	00:21:10,783	00:21:14,623	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I don't hear the word lethal injection or execution or anything else without
EDL	00:21:15,391	00:21:17,184	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Feeling a tug
EDL	00:21:17,184	00:21:18,464	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	It's it's tied to me
EDL	00:21:18,464	00:21:19,232	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I mean I'll always be
EDL	00:21:20,000	00:21:26,400	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Which he live to regret he thinks that he actually extended the life of the death penalty and he actually eventually quit
EDL	00:21:26,400	00:21:29,472	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	This job becomes a pastor and becomes a very
EDL	00:21:29,472	00:21:31,520	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	A strong anti-death penalty
EDL	00:21:32,032	00:21:32,800	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Advocate
EDL	00:21:32,800	00:21:34,080	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	How does a man
EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:35,360	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Who came up with the recipe
EDL	00:21:35,360	00:21:35,872	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	For lethal injection
EDL	00:21:37,408	00:21:38,432	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	What does he do on judging
EDL	00:21:39,712	00:21:41,248	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The same thing everyone else does
EDL	00:21:42,016	00:21:44,064	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So ourselves on the mercy of God
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:46,112	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Say that way
EDL	00:21:46,112	00:21:46,880	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Have done wrong
EDL	00:21:50,208	00:21:55,072	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Nothing that I find really interesting is that if you look at the Modern lethal injection cocktail
EDL	00:21:55,072	00:21:55,840	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Three drugs
EDL	00:21:55,840	00:21:59,168	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	FasTrak special needs Society II drug paralyzes you
EDL	00:21:59,168	00:22:01,728	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And the Third Reich is the answer that stops
EDL	00:22:01,728	00:22:02,752	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Tartan Kilt
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:08,640	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In this drug cocktail you kind of see everything that we want and need from the death penalty just kind of all mix
EDL	00:22:09,152	00:22:09,664	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Together
EDL	00:22:10,944	00:22:15,040	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The third drug the drug that stops your heart that's kind of our sense of justice
EDL	00:22:15,040	00:22:17,856	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The first drug the anesthetic
EDL	00:22:17,856	00:22:20,672	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Kind of our sense of humanity or kindness
EDL	00:22:20,672	00:22:22,464	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	That second drug
EDL	00:22:22,464	00:22:24,256	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The one that paralyzes their muscle
EDL	00:22:24,256	00:22:25,536	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Fold the second draw
EDL	00:22:25,536	00:22:27,072	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Is purely cosmetic
EDL	00:22:27,072	00:22:28,608	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	It sucks
EDL	00:22:28,608	00:22:30,144	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	No medical purpose
EDL	00:22:30,144	00:22:35,264	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The reason it was put into the lethal injection cocktail in the first place was
EDL	00:22:35,264	00:22:36,288	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So that
EDL	00:22:36,288	00:22:39,104	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	FasTrak doesn't work effectively
EDL	00:22:39,872	00:22:43,712	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The second drug will mask any signs of
EDL	00:22:44,480	00:22:48,832	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Visible suffering and it would be extremely significant
EDL	00:22:48,832	00:22:50,624	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Because potassium chloride
EDL	00:22:50,624	00:22:53,952	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Potent acid that people have described as
EDL	00:22:53,952	00:22:58,304	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Being like fire going through your veins and being burnt alive from the inside
EDL	00:22:59,584	00:23:02,144	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	She said just imagine that that's happening to you
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:04,960	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But something goes wrong with the anesthetic and you become conscious
EDL	00:23:05,472	00:23:06,496	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	You have this
EDL	00:23:06,496	00:23:08,544	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Burning acid going through your body
EDL	00:23:09,312	00:23:11,872	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And you're paralyzed all your voluntary muscles
EDL	00:23:11,872	00:23:12,640	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Paralyzed
EDL	00:23:12,640	00:23:14,432	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So you can't say
EDL	00:23:14,432	00:23:18,016	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I'm awake I can feel everything this is agony
EDL	00:23:18,016	00:23:23,904	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	She says that it's that second drug that is both the thing that could make the execution most torturous
EDL	00:23:24,928	00:23:26,720	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And the thing that meant that
EDL	00:23:26,720	00:23:28,512	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Tweed Witnesses the views
EDL	00:23:28,512	00:23:29,280	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Public
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:30,816	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Wouldn't know that it was torture
EDL	00:23:31,328	00:23:33,120	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Because we weren't supposed to know that
EDL	00:23:34,144	00:23:36,448	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	2 does she end up going after that second drug
EDL	00:23:36,448	00:23:42,080	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The paralytic no actually seek she goes after the first ride the anesthetic and it's a total coincidence this is just
EDL	00:23:42,080	00:23:44,896	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The one that had manufacturing problems that started the arms race
EDL	00:23:45,664	00:23:47,456	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But it turns out that
EDL	00:23:47,456	00:23:48,992	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	This drug
EDL	00:23:48,992	00:23:49,504	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Sodium fire
EDL	00:23:50,016	00:23:51,808	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The anesthetic is the one that's
EDL	00:23:51,808	00:23:54,112	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The most constitutionally important drug
EDL	00:23:54,112	00:24:00,512	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Because in 2008 when the Supreme Court ruled on lethal injection they said
EDL	00:24:00,512	00:24:03,840	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The first drug is necessary to prevent the prisoner
EDL	00:24:03,840	00:24:06,144	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	From experiencing severe pain
EDL	00:24:06,144	00:24:07,424	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So there's no anesthetic
EDL	00:24:07,424	00:24:08,448	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	There's pain
EDL	00:24:08,960	00:24:13,824	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Which would be too severe and then be there for what an Eighth Amendment violation
EDL	00:24:13,824	00:24:15,360	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Cruel unusual punishment
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:18,944	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So that drug the anesthetic is the key drug
EDL	00:24:18,944	00:24:24,832	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But over the past five and a half years is Maya has like Wacom old her way across these different companies
EDL	00:24:25,344	00:24:27,648	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	She just made it harder and harder to get
EDL	00:24:27,648	00:24:30,208	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	There now 20 + companies
EDL	00:24:30,208	00:24:36,352	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Who have they said we disapprove of the misuse of medicine executions than we going to take steps to prevent
EDL	00:24:36,864	00:24:42,496	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And that has States scrambling the drugs used in a 32 death penalty States
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:48,896	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Or now running out run out of drugs and is it resolved but you seems that things have gotten very DIY
EDL	00:24:48,896	00:24:53,504	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Weather changing and trying new procedures never used before in the history of execution
EDL	00:24:53,504	00:24:56,320	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Prison officials are in a difficult position
EDL	00:24:56,320	00:25:02,720	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Human have the da start rating prison

EDL	00:25:09,120	00:25:15,008	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In the middle of all that he began kicking his feet lifting his head in his chest off the gurney grimacing
EDL	00:25:15,520	00:25:16,544	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	How do you also get
EDL	00:25:16,544	00:25:17,568	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Seems like this
EDL	00:25:17,568	00:25:20,896	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	High Country season in and a couple moments he actually mumbled
EDL	00:25:20,896	00:25:26,272	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	You would open his mouth and you'd see his chest move and we'll go all the way down to stomach so so clear gas
EDL	00:25:27,296	00:25:33,696	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	April 29th 2014 in Oklahoma a man in Clayton Lockett was being executed for murder rape and

EDL	00:25:40,096	00:25:40,864	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Conscious but
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,656	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Started thrashing

EDL	00:25:55,456	00:26:01,856	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Your situations like this in Arizona Ohio this drug formula is unconstitutional because
EDL	00:26:01,856	00:26:05,440	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Started filing a bunch of lawsuits and one of these eventually got to
EDL	00:26:05,440	00:26:05,952	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Supreme Court

EDL	00:28:09,600	00:28:16,000	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Is there an argument to be made here I mean I get what you're saying that like all these different people in different countries have been like unknowingly

EDL	00:28:17,536	00:28:21,120	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Execution team which doesn't seem fair but isn't there an argument to be made that like
EDL	00:28:21,632	00:28:22,656	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Even so
EDL	00:28:23,424	00:28:26,240	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The effect is that she has taken a death penalty that is
EDL	00:28:26,752	00:28:28,800	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Kind of Humane Maybe
EDL	00:28:28,800	00:28:30,080	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And made it more cruel
EDL	00:28:30,080	00:28:32,384	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Because that's kind of the accusation in the air
EDL	00:28:32,896	00:28:33,408	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	It's
EDL	00:28:34,432	00:28:37,248	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I'm going to say two things one of them
EDL	00:28:37,248	00:28:39,040	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	She didn't cause it she's
EDL	00:28:39,040	00:28:45,440	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The states are chasing the companies and she's chasing the states rights so like you can't say that she caused it but what you more important
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:48,768	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But you also can't say is that it is actually more cruel
EDL	00:28:48,768	00:28:49,536	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Because
EDL	00:28:49,536	00:28:51,072	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	There's no evidence
EDL	00:28:51,072	00:28:52,352	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	That there's been an in

EDL	00:28:54,144	00:28:56,960	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	What I think is happening is just that we're paying
EDL	00:28:56,960	00:28:58,752	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	More attention to lethal injection
EDL	00:28:58,752	00:28:59,520	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Tonight we're just
EDL	00:28:59,520	00:29:00,032	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Looking at it more
EDL	00:29:01,568	00:29:04,384	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Bosch excuse has been happening forever and we're just now noticed
EDL	00:29:04,896	00:29:05,664	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Yeah
EDL	00:29:05,664	00:29:09,248	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	None the less people do accuse her of making this more cruel and nausea
EDL	00:29:10,016	00:29:10,784	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The drugs
EDL	00:29:10,784	00:29:11,552	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Because
EDL	00:29:11,552	00:29:16,416	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	States in their sort of desperation to still be able to do this are looking for other ways
EDL	00:29:16,416	00:29:16,928	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	To do it
EDL	00:29:17,440	00:29:18,720	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And some of those ways
EDL	00:29:19,232	00:29:21,024	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Might seem like we're going
EDL	00:29:22,304	00:29:23,072	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The lady that was
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:28,448	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Spearheaded the getting rid of the injections all she did is basically force people to be shot
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:32,288	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	This Paul Wray state representative house district 13 Utah
EDL	00:29:33,312	00:29:35,616	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	He says one day he was sitting in his office
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:39,968	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	That was actually listening to the local NPR station in federal judge in Oklahoma
EDL	00:29:39,968	00:29:41,760	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And they're talking about
EDL	00:29:41,760	00:29:43,552	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	European pharmaceutical companies
EDL	00:29:43,552	00:29:45,088	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Used to provide this country

EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:50,976	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	European drug companies no longer selling the drug cocktail
EDL	00:29:51,488	00:29:56,096	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So I called our department of corrections and says hey do we have access to the drug and they said no we don't
EDL	00:29:56,608	00:29:58,912	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	How you know we have a set amount and then we're out
EDL	00:29:58,912	00:30:00,704	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Because he hung up the phone.
EDL	00:30:00,704	00:30:02,496	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Thinking a little bit of research
EDL	00:30:02,496	00:30:04,544	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Kind of deep into the history and
EDL	00:30:04,544	00:30:09,664	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Eventually came to the conclusion well let's revert back the firing squad
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:15,296	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Play me like firing squad John Wayne firing squad like line up against the wall
EDL	00:30:15,296	00:30:19,648	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	No it's like they have a chair and they bring the person into the room and they strap
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:26,048	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Them to the chair they put a hood over their head position will look at the heart and I'll pin a Target where the heart is and then there's five men with r
EDL	00:30:26,048	00:30:29,120	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Rifles and one of them has a blank but none of them know which one it is
EDL	00:30:29,120	00:30:32,448	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And then on the 20 orders given they all shoot the individual
EDL	00:30:32,448	00:30:32,960	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In the heart
EDL	00:30:33,472	00:30:39,872	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Lawmakers in Utah voted to bring back executions by firing squad

EDL	00:30:46,272	00:30:52,672	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Completely taken off guard by the media frenzy that

EDL	00:30:59,072	00:31:02,144	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Stopping it now is an embarrassment that barbaric
EDL	00:31:02,144	00:31:05,728	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	We should be shooting our people this is ridiculous this is not the time

EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,544	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Why is it sad
EDL	00:31:09,056	00:31:10,848	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Do you think the firing squad itself
EDL	00:31:11,616	00:31:12,128	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Created this
EDL	00:31:13,408	00:31:15,200	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Well it it's it's brutal
EDL	00:31:15,200	00:31:19,552	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	You know it's it's certainly not the easy give him a couple of injections in
EDL	00:31:20,064	00:31:21,088	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	They quietly
EDL	00:31:21,088	00:31:21,600	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Go down
EDL	00:31:22,112	00:31:24,160	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	You know this is calling it for what it is
EDL	00:31:24,160	00:31:24,928	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In fact
EDL	00:31:24,928	00:31:27,232	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I would argue you want to look at
EDL	00:31:27,232	00:31:29,792	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	At something that's more Humane and you definitely the fiery sky
EDL	00:31:31,072	00:31:35,168	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	What caught my attention was it was so sudden so quick

EDL	00:31:42,848	00:31:45,408	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Pretty quickly it was cleaner than I expected
EDL	00:31:46,176	00:31:47,200	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And it was fast
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:48,992	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	With the firing squad
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,528	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Yeah your ear dead Within

EDL	00:31:55,648	00:31:58,464	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Not the paralytic that hides its is done
EDL	00:31:59,744	00:32:00,768	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Buddy buddy moved
EDL	00:32:02,048	00:32:03,328	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	He moved a little bit
EDL	00:32:04,864	00:32:06,400	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	To some degree that bothers me
EDL	00:32:07,424	00:32:08,960	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And that seemed to carry on
EDL	00:32:09,472	00:32:10,240	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Alaska

EDL	00:32:30,464	00:32:35,840	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	That's Justice Scalia in 2008 the Supreme Court actually approve the firing squad in 1879
EDL	00:32:37,120	00:32:40,960	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And the people who are part of the firing squad are actually volunteers
EDL	00:32:40,960	00:32:47,360	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Do you have a lack of volunteers or in abundance of volunteers
EDL	00:32:47,360	00:32:48,128	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	They had hundreds
EDL	00:32:48,640	00:32:50,432	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I'm nobody's forced to do it is
EDL	00:32:50,432	00:32:53,760	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Another there are people that are willing that big Tennessee is their civic duty

EDL	00:33:01,696	00:33:05,536	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	If you put me in touch with somebody who's actually been involved with the firing squad
EDL	00:33:07,072	00:33:07,840	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I'll call somebody
EDL	00:33:07,840	00:33:08,352	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Okay
EDL	00:33:10,400	00:33:11,424	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Better wait till this thing
EDL	00:33:14,496	00:33:16,544	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	16th and Hill Air Force Base
EDL	00:33:16,544	00:33:18,080	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	All right I like it the sound of
EDL	00:33:18,080	00:33:23,968	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	This is Kenny we agreed not to use his last name and Ken's Dad ran the firing squad for a couple of decades
EDL	00:33:24,480	00:33:28,320	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	So as you see there's two cottonwood trees over here those old cottonwood trees
EDL	00:33:28,320	00:33:29,344	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	They'd set up an
EDL	00:33:29,344	00:33:31,136	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And that's what they would drill the firing squad
EDL	00:33:32,160	00:33:34,208	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	These men were selected because for one there
EDL	00:33:34,720	00:33:35,488	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Absolute monarchs
EDL	00:33:36,512	00:33:38,560	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Tuesday just had moral clarity
EDL	00:33:39,584	00:33:40,096	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	They
EDL	00:33:40,608	00:33:44,192	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Many of them did not want to be on there but once they were called
EDL	00:33:44,704	00:33:45,984	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	They felt obligated
EDL	00:33:45,984	00:33:46,752	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	To see it through
EDL	00:33:46,752	00:33:51,872	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And told me that on execution days his dad and the other Shooters they would sit down together at the
EDL	00:33:51,872	00:33:55,200	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Kitchen table and you know it's just like a little family family breakfast
EDL	00:33:55,200	00:33:56,992	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	This mom should make coffee and
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:34:01,344	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	She would do scones or biscuits and gravy and she wanted those men to know
EDL	00:34:02,368	00:34:04,160	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	That it wasn't easy and that she appreciated
EDL	00:34:04,928	00:34:08,000	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I know there was a lot of prayerful times around the house and nose
EDL	00:34:08,768	00:34:11,072	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Mentor over getting ready and I know that
EDL	00:34:12,608	00:34:13,120	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I am
EDL	00:34:13,888	00:34:16,192	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	It is pretty solemn moment I prayer
EDL	00:34:16,704	00:34:19,520	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Is it for the person being executed the victim with
EDL	00:34:19,520	00:34:20,288	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The prayer
EDL	00:34:20,288	00:34:22,848	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I think you have to pray for strength to follow through on what you have
EDL	00:34:26,176	00:34:26,944	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I think that
EDL	00:34:27,968	00:34:31,296	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	You know you might need a little guidance and you might need a little understanding and
EDL	00:34:31,808	00:34:33,600	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And something bigger than yous out there
EDL	00:34:34,880	00:34:35,904	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I think that
EDL	00:34:35,904	00:34:40,000	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	If we're going to have the death penalty people just have to understand that there's some savagery involved in it
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:41,792	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And nah
EDL	00:34:42,304	00:34:44,608	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	It's unfortunate that it is but
EDL	00:34:45,376	00:34:46,400	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	If we have it to do list
EDL	00:34:46,912	00:34:48,192	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Let's do it let's do it humanely
EDL	00:34:50,496	00:34:53,056	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	One of the things that I found kind of striking is that
EDL	00:34:53,056	00:34:57,408	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	My afoa is against the death penalty and you have to focus in Utah that are for it
EDL	00:34:57,920	00:34:59,968	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But everyone seems to agree that
EDL	00:35:01,248	00:35:02,528	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	We shouldn't fool ourselves
EDL	00:35:02,528	00:35:04,320	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I favor the death penalty
EDL	00:35:04,320	00:35:08,672	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But one thing I've never favored in some common ground between me and the abolitionists
EDL	00:35:09,696	00:35:11,232	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Is that lethal injection
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:12,768	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Is a terrible method of
EDL	00:35:12,768	00:35:13,536	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Execution
EDL	00:35:13,536	00:35:16,352	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	That's Robert blecker at a New York law school professors
EDL	00:35:16,352	00:35:18,144	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Sounding a little bit like Maya
EDL	00:35:18,656	00:35:21,728	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But he says he objects to lethal injection not because it's
EDL	00:35:21,728	00:35:23,776	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Cruel not because it might cause
EDL	00:35:23,776	00:35:24,544	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Pain
EDL	00:35:24,544	00:35:26,848	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But because it certainly causes confusion
EDL	00:35:26,848	00:35:27,872	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	I attended
EDL	00:35:28,384	00:35:29,920	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	An execution in Florida
EDL	00:35:30,432	00:35:31,456	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Bennie Demps
EDL	00:35:32,224	00:35:36,832	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And I also was with my father-in-law when he was in a hospice dying for
EDL	00:35:36,832	00:35:38,880	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	From an incurable and very painful cancer
EDL	00:35:39,648	00:35:41,184	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And the death scene
EDL	00:35:41,184	00:35:41,952	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In both
EDL	00:35:41,952	00:35:42,976	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Situations
EDL	00:35:42,976	00:35:44,512	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	This was bizarrely similar
EDL	00:35:45,280	00:35:47,072	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In both cases the
EDL	00:35:47,072	00:35:49,376	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The person dying was
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:51,936	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Lying on a gurney with an IV coming out of his arm
EDL	00:35:52,448	00:35:53,984	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Wrapped in white sheets
EDL	00:35:54,496	00:35:58,080	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Medical technicians at his side surrounded by loved ones
EDL	00:35:58,592	00:36:01,152	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And it struck me as bizarre
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:04,480	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	That we are killing Those whom we love
EDL	00:36:04,992	00:36:06,784	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In a fashion
EDL	00:36:06,784	00:36:08,576	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	That's so nearly resembles
EDL	00:36:08,576	00:36:11,136	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	How we are killing those we rightfully
EDL	00:36:11,136	00:36:11,648	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Detest
EDL	00:36:12,160	00:36:15,488	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	There should be no resemblance this isn't medicine this is
EDL	00:36:15,488	00:36:16,256	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Punishment
EDL	00:36:16,256	00:36:18,048	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The firing squad
EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:24,960	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Is honest and acknowledges itself for what it is I have one objection to the traditional firing squad
EDL	00:36:24,960	00:36:26,496	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Glad that you tie uses
EDL	00:36:26,496	00:36:30,848	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	He says he doesn't like the fact that one person get the blank and that nobody knows who that person is
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:33,152	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	That to me is symptomatic
EDL	00:36:33,664	00:36:37,504	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Of our failure once again to take responsibility for what we do
EDL	00:36:37,504	00:36:38,528	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Nobody should have a black
EDL	00:36:39,296	00:36:41,088	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	If we cannot face what we're doing
EDL	00:36:41,856	00:36:42,880	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And acknowledge it
EDL	00:36:43,648	00:36:44,416	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Then we shouldn't do it
EDL	00:36:51,328	00:36:57,728	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	And we may be coming to a moment where we are about to do that to look at this and acknowledge it
EDL	00:36:57,728	00:36:58,496	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Because
EDL	00:36:58,496	00:37:04,128	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In 2014 in a case that was really just about lethal injection just as viruses look like
EDL	00:37:04,128	00:37:05,664	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Stop
EDL	00:37:05,664	00:37:10,784	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Just talking about the details like questions about which medicine that we use
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:14,368	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	For the court to consider a basic question
EDL	00:37:14,880	00:37:17,952	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Weather
EDL	00:37:17,952	00:37:18,720	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Institution
EDL	00:37:18,720	00:37:20,512	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In other words what he's saying is
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:25,632	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	It's time to talk about not just like the mechanics of what we're doing
EDL	00:37:27,424	00:37:29,728	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But whether we should even do it at all
EDL	00:37:36,384	00:37:42,528	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Reporter Karen Duffin
EDL	00:37:49,184	00:37:55,584	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Now when Breyer said that in 2014 he was into the scent lost the case but
EDL	00:37:55,584	00:38:01,984	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	A lot of people saw that statement as this invitation like Breyers saying to the lawyers of America send us case
EDL	00:38:01,984	00:38:08,384	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	In fact some of those cases have just started to arrive 2 days ago a case
EDL	00:38:08,384	00:38:14,784	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Made it in front of the court almost made the US Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to hear in a few
EDL	00:38:14,784	00:38:21,184	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Asserting that the death penalty violate the US Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment

EDL	00:38:27,584	00:38:30,144	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	They're on the way you're something else it happened while we were reporting this
EDL	00:38:30,144	00:38:31,680	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Destroy this one for about 2 weeks ago
EDL	00:38:31,680	00:38:34,496	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has announced
EDL	00:38:34,496	00:38:40,896	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	But it will no longer allow its drugs to be used in Lethal Injections

EDL	00:38:43,968	00:38:45,248	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	This basically
EDL	00:38:45,760	00:38:46,784	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Cake white sage
EDL	00:38:46,784	00:38:50,112	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Spells the end of lethal injection in the United States but it's closed
EDL	00:38:50,112	00:38:51,904	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	Because now any states that want to keep doing it
EDL	00:38:52,672	00:38:54,208	| moreperfect060216_cruelandunusualrev1 |	They essentially have to go underground
