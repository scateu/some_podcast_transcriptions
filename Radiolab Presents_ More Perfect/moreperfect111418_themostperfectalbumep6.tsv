EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:47,039	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	The beginning
EDL	00:14:47,551	00:14:51,135	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Was it a time when America was choosing its very first president
EDL	00:14:53,951	00:14:58,303	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	George motherfuckin Washington
EDL	00:14:58,303	00:14:58,815	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	10 president
EDL	00:14:59,839	00:15:02,655	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Was arguably the most famous person in the western world
EDL	00:15:03,935	00:15:07,263	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	This is denver brunsman

EDL	00:15:22,623	00:15:23,135	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	But
EDL	00:15:23,903	00:15:25,951	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Is clear the weather we didn't want it was
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:29,279	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Pretty unclear what exactly are presidency should look like
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:32,863	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Up to that point I mean going all the way back to ancient times

EDL	00:21:34,080	00:21:36,384	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	How much power a president should have
EDL	00:21:36,384	00:21:38,176	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Wartime is one thing but

EDL	00:21:39,200	00:21:40,224	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Let's return to the
EDL	00:21:40,224	00:21:40,736	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Conventional
EDL	00:21:41,504	00:21:43,552	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Let's make it a constitutional
EDL	00:21:45,088	00:21:45,856	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	22nd
EDL	00:21:46,368	00:21:49,696	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	No person shall be elected to the Office of the President more than twice
EDL	00:21:50,464	00:21:52,256	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	And no person who has held the office
EDL	00:21:52,256	00:21:54,304	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	The president or acted as president
EDL	00:21:54,304	00:21:58,400	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	For more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president
EDL	00:21:58,912	00:22:01,728	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Shall be elected to the office of President more than once
EDL	00:22:02,752	00:22:04,288	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	That means two terms
EDL	00:22:04,288	00:22:07,360	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	You're out right right exactly on one hand it does seem kind of
EDL	00:22:07,872	00:22:10,688	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Undemocratic to me in some ways that the American people
EDL	00:22:10,688	00:22:11,968	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Continue to say
EDL	00:22:11,968	00:22:13,760	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Yes we want that person
EDL	00:22:13,760	00:22:16,832	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	And there's an election every four years we respect the result of
EDL	00:22:17,344	00:22:19,904	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	It seems a little bit undemocratic to me that we
EDL	00:22:19,904	00:22:21,440	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Would be limited as
EDL	00:22:21,440	00:22:22,720	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	As American people
EDL	00:22:22,720	00:22:23,488	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	I think you're right
EDL	00:22:24,000	00:22:26,048	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Text Julie Metzger again
EDL	00:22:26,560	00:22:28,864	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Present only stays on repeatedly depression is Real ACT
EDL	00:22:29,888	00:22:30,400	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	So
EDL	00:22:31,168	00:22:35,008	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	I think there is a strong Democratic argument of
EDL	00:22:35,008	00:22:37,824	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Presidents whose able to get reelected in able to
EDL	00:22:38,336	00:22:40,384	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Generate popular support
EDL	00:22:40,384	00:22:44,480	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	The Democratic answer would be to let the people elect the president
EDL	00:22:44,992	00:22:48,320	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	On the other hand Gillian says the presence of these days is soap
EDL	00:22:48,320	00:22:50,880	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Powerful that once the president gets an office
EDL	00:22:51,392	00:22:57,792	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	They can bully at the competition they have access to all these resources a giant megaphone I think we have to
EDL	00:22:57,792	00:23:02,144	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Acknowledge that there are a lot of factors that those limit
EDL	00:23:02,144	00:23:03,424	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	The extent to which
EDL	00:23:03,424	00:23:06,240	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	The result of our presidential elections are reflections
EDL	00:23:06,240	00:23:08,032	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Of popular will
EDL	00:23:08,032	00:23:10,592	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Pure and simple the 22nd Amendment
EDL	00:23:10,592	00:23:13,152	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Might be undemocratic it does Tire hands
EDL	00:23:14,176	00:23:15,200	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	At the same time
EDL	00:23:15,712	00:23:16,736	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Maybe that's a good thing
EDL	00:23:17,248	00:23:18,272	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	I mean take
EDL	00:23:18,272	00:23:20,064	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	As an analogy the story of
EDL	00:23:21,856	00:23:22,368	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Ulysses
EDL	00:23:29,280	00:23:33,632	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Inewstore Ulysses and his men have to sail past the sirens in
EDL	00:23:33,632	00:23:36,704	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Byron Stingily beautiful songs that lure Sailors to their death
EDL	00:23:37,216	00:23:43,616	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	So Ulysses knows he's not going to be able to resist the song so he tells of men
EDL	00:23:43,616	00:23:49,760	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	I'm not going to be able to resist just tie me up
EDL	00:23:52,064	00:23:56,160	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	And then we'll go past the sign cuz I can't trust myself in the moment to make the right decision
EDL	00:23:57,184	00:23:58,976	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Perhaps the 22nd Amendment
EDL	00:23:59,488	00:24:01,280	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	Is a little like that rope
EDL	00:24:02,048	00:24:08,448	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	The Ulysses uses to bind his hands so he doesn't waver
EDL	00:24:08,448	00:24:09,216	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	If it's a profit locked
EDL	00:24:12,032	00:24:15,104	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	There will be times when it will cost us
EDL	00:24:15,616	00:24:16,896	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	A good present we might want to keep
EDL	00:24:18,176	00:24:22,528	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	But it's a prophylactic measure to not let ourselves really entertaining those thoughts
EDL	00:24:24,064	00:24:25,344	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	I'm go down that road
EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:35,584	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	It's one small way we've chosen to protect ourselves from that Sirens song Those kingly win
EDL	00:24:36,352	00:24:36,864	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	President
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:45,312	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	But sometimes blow
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:55,296	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	That was pretty sirkeli Prime

EDL	00:24:57,600	00:24:59,136	| moreperfect111418_themostperfectalbumep6 |	For the 22nd Amendment
