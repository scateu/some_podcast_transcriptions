EDL	00:26:10,560	00:26:14,656	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	We go behind the scenes into the mines actually of the justices
EDL	00:26:14,656	00:26:17,472	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	As they deliberate backstage about what to do next
EDL	00:26:18,496	00:26:19,776	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	And things get kind of weird
EDL	00:26:37,184	00:26:40,000	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	In the Supreme Court today a debate about the movie
EDL	00:26:40,000	00:26:40,768	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Sort of
EDL	00:26:40,768	00:26:41,792	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Producers of a

EDL	00:26:48,960	00:26:49,472	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Is unkind
EDL	00:26:50,496	00:26:54,848	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Alright so after oral arguments wrapped up the justices retreated
EDL	00:26:55,360	00:26:57,152	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	To what is perhaps the most
EDL	00:26:57,152	00:26:57,920	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Secretive
EDL	00:26:57,920	00:26:58,432	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Place
EDL	00:26:58,944	00:26:59,968	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	In the known universe
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:03,552	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	In the most private and perhaps important place inside the

EDL	00:27:04,320	00:27:05,856	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	For lease inside the court.
EDL	00:27:06,368	00:27:07,136	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	And only then
EDL	00:27:07,648	00:27:10,208	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Meet together around a table in the Justice
EDL	00:27:10,208	00:27:10,976	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Is conference room
EDL	00:27:11,488	00:27:13,024	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	They discuss the cases
EDL	00:27:13,024	00:27:14,048	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Heard an oral argument
EDL	00:27:14,560	00:27:15,584	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	And begin the process
EDL	00:27:16,352	00:27:17,632	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Of reaching a decision of the Court
EDL	00:27:18,400	00:27:20,960	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	This is a place where cameras will never go
EDL	00:27:20,960	00:27:22,496	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	No one can enter the room
EDL	00:27:23,008	00:27:25,568	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Except for some reason C-SPAN
EDL	00:27:26,080	00:27:27,616	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	UC spans feature documentary
EDL	00:27:28,128	00:27:29,152	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The Supreme Court
EDL	00:27:29,152	00:27:33,760	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	What's 1 * C-SPAN those bastards were able to get into this room and film
EDL	00:27:33,760	00:27:34,272	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The table
EDL	00:27:34,784	00:27:35,296	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	In the chair
EDL	00:27:37,344	00:27:41,696	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I'm actually quite jealous cuz they didn't let us do that they didn't let us see
EDL	00:27:41,696	00:27:45,024	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Special room or speak to the justices so she's been yeah
EDL	00:27:45,536	00:27:47,584	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	They have some kind of deal with the devil anyhow
EDL	00:27:47,584	00:27:49,120	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	When is we don't know
EDL	00:27:49,632	00:27:52,704	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	What happened in that room on that day but
EDL	00:27:52,704	00:27:54,496	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	We can piece together a couple of things
EDL	00:27:55,008	00:27:57,568	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Imagine the rest of me we know that they went in
EDL	00:27:58,080	00:27:59,872	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Clarence Thomas put on some tunes
EDL	00:28:00,384	00:28:02,944	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	RBG was like wow that book thing I need a drink
EDL	00:28:03,968	00:28:07,552	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Actually don't know that either those two things happen but it makes sense to me the Clarence Thomas
EDL	00:28:08,320	00:28:09,344	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Would like to do bees
EDL	00:28:09,856	00:28:10,880	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I just feels
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:11,904	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Right
EDL	00:28:12,416	00:28:18,816	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	But what we do know is that the Justice sat down in the usual order they said
EDL	00:28:18,816	00:28:21,376	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The conference table in the same places every day
EDL	00:28:21,376	00:28:24,704	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Chief justice Roberts gets things going with some discussion
EDL	00:28:24,704	00:28:25,984	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Discussion
EDL	00:28:25,984	00:28:27,008	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Pornography case
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:27,776	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Save this cases
EDL	00:28:28,288	00:28:29,056	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	About this
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,336	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The arguments are
EDL	00:28:30,848	00:28:31,360	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	7 spelling
EDL	00:28:31,872	00:28:33,408	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I think we should reverse
EDL	00:28:33,408	00:28:35,712	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	So there's some conversation and then
EDL	00:28:36,736	00:28:39,552	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Because again this is standard the Chief Justice called for a vote
EDL	00:28:41,088	00:28:42,880	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	This is the part we care about he
EDL	00:28:42,880	00:28:46,720	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Presumably as his colleagues okay who here thinks it's citizens united has a case
EDL	00:28:47,744	00:28:50,304	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Now we know that the four liberal justices
EDL	00:28:50,304	00:28:51,584	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Steven Spencer Briar Suter
EDL	00:28:52,608	00:28:53,376	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	We're like no
EDL	00:28:53,888	00:28:54,912	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	They do not have a case
EDL	00:28:55,424	00:29:00,032	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	All that citizens united is doing is making a campaign ad this is electioneering
EDL	00:29:00,032	00:29:02,592	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	They're pretending it's a dark but really it's not they should be right here
EDL	00:29:03,104	00:29:04,384	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	On the other side
EDL	00:29:04,384	00:29:05,920	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	We know that the for conservatives
EDL	00:29:06,432	00:29:07,968	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Scalia thomas alito Roberts
EDL	00:29:08,992	00:29:11,296	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	We're like yeah they got a case
EDL	00:29:11,808	00:29:14,624	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Citizens United First Amendment rights are being pinched
EDL	00:29:15,648	00:29:16,672	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Until you had a split
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:22,560	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Like you often do on the score for liberals or conservatives but there are nine justices so as always
EDL	00:29:22,560	00:29:24,096	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	All attention turned
EDL	00:29:25,632	00:29:28,448	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	To the man in the middle
EDL	00:29:30,240	00:29:32,544	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	30 years
EDL	00:29:32,544	00:29:35,616	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Is often the Swing Vote making his opinion critica
EDL	00:29:35,616	00:29:36,896	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	He is considered
EDL	00:29:36,896	00:29:42,784	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The courts pivotal Swing Vote has basically split down the middle for 4
EDL	00:29:42,784	00:29:48,416	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	One ring to rule them all
EDL	00:29:48,416	00:29:51,488	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	All right let's just talk about Justice Kennedy for second he has been
EDL	00:29:52,000	00:29:53,792	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The Swing Vote on this court
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:59,424	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	So many times that is often called the most powerful person in America
EDL	00:29:59,936	00:30:01,216	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Because very often his boat
EDL	00:30:01,728	00:30:02,752	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Is the only one that matters
EDL	00:30:04,032	00:30:07,616	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	You could argue that this one dude as determine more about your life
EDL	00:30:07,616	00:30:08,128	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	As an American
EDL	00:30:08,640	00:30:10,432	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Can almost any other single guy
EDL	00:30:13,248	00:30:14,016	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	But
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:14,784	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	From the outside
EDL	00:30:15,552	00:30:17,856	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	People who don't really know much about the court II
EDL	00:30:17,856	00:30:18,880	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Me you
EDL	00:30:19,648	00:30:21,184	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Not maybe not you but me
EDL	00:30:21,696	00:30:27,840	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	It can be really hard to predict what he is going to do on any given case which way is going to swing
EDL	00:30:28,608	00:30:29,120	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	For example
EDL	00:30:30,144	00:30:32,960	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Arabic voting rights case he sides with the conservative
EDL	00:30:32,960	00:30:39,104	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The Marshall Plan was very good to the Morrill Act of Northwest Ordinance
EDL	00:30:40,896	00:30:42,176	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	It does
EDL	00:30:42,944	00:30:43,712	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	100%
EDL	00:30:44,224	00:30:45,504	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Goes to the developer in
EDL	00:30:47,040	00:30:50,624	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Now on gun rights the Heller case if you talk about
EDL	00:30:50,624	00:30:51,904	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Aswan conservative
EDL	00:30:52,928	00:30:59,328	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I view it as a general right to bear arms quite without reference to the militia either way but Environmental Protection
EDL	00:30:59,328	00:31:01,632	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Is liberal greater than harm the greater the risk
EDL	00:31:01,632	00:31:05,472	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Class action goes conservative
EDL	00:31:05,472	00:31:07,264	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	What is the unlawful
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:10,592	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Gay marriage is liberal
EDL	00:31:11,104	00:31:12,384	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Exercise the fundamental right
EDL	00:31:12,384	00:31:13,664	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Sumerian Allstate
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:15,712	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	No longer may this Liberty be denied to them
EDL	00:31:19,808	00:31:22,112	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I want to be
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:23,648	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	So
EDL	00:31:24,416	00:31:28,768	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	When the Chief Justice went around the room and got to Kennedy was like alright Kennedy what's a Gummy this time
EDL	00:31:29,280	00:31:30,560	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	From the outside
EDL	00:31:30,560	00:31:31,584	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	It was anyone's guess
EDL	00:31:32,864	00:31:36,192	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	But as I mentioned one of the Serta cool things about the citizens united
EDL	00:31:36,192	00:31:36,704	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Case
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:40,288	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Is it gives you a little window into the mind of this
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:43,360	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Very powerful very mysterious man
EDL	00:31:43,360	00:31:44,384	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	So before you answers
EDL	00:31:46,432	00:31:52,832	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I was wanting
EDL	00:31:52,832	00:31:55,904	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Romania Bucharest Romania
EDL	00:31:55,904	00:31:57,184	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	In the days of communism
EDL	00:31:57,952	00:32:04,096	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	You may wonder why is there an Eastern European man in the brain of Justice Anthony Kennedy that'll make sense to men
EDL	00:32:05,120	00:32:09,728	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	For now all you know is that this is Alex Kozinski he's an influential judge
EDL	00:32:09,728	00:32:12,800	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Is it in the 9th circuit in California
EDL	00:32:13,312	00:32:18,432	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	It was actually a party member it was a member of the party before the war
EDL	00:32:18,432	00:32:23,040	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Truly believe in communism if I was a great system and
EDL	00:32:24,832	00:32:26,112	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	How to remember the moment
EDL	00:32:26,624	00:32:33,024	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	When he was at his dad's office because I was about 7 years old or 7 or 8 or something and my father wasn't there

EDL	00:32:39,424	00:32:40,704	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Called free Romania
EDL	00:32:41,216	00:32:42,496	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	And so I
EDL	00:32:42,496	00:32:43,776	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Read free Romania
EDL	00:32:44,288	00:32:50,176	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	And then I ain't so sure I've sent to be funny I guess I said well I don't know why they called kilmainham because there's so many people in prison
EDL	00:32:50,944	00:32:55,040	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	You just thought he was making a joke my father into very serious trouble
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:57,856	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The officials essentially threatened his dad
EDL	00:32:58,368	00:33:01,440	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Because of this job question was whether the they were teaching me
EDL	00:33:01,440	00:33:03,232	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Disloyal things at home
EDL	00:33:03,232	00:33:06,560	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Eventually they clear them but it was it was touch-and-go
EDL	00:33:07,328	00:33:12,448	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	So after that my father had this signal he says if you're ever in public with me and

EDL	00:33:41,632	00:33:44,448	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	He says he told Anthony Kennedy the story oh yes
EDL	00:33:44,448	00:33:50,848	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	And they talked a lot about what it's like to live in a place where you can't speak your mind of course I know who knows
EDL	00:33:50,848	00:33:54,432	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	What exact effect has had on Anthony Kennedy's mine but we know
EDL	00:33:54,944	00:33:56,992	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	That story is in there my honor
EDL	00:33:57,504	00:33:58,528	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I will do my best
EDL	00:33:58,528	00:34:01,600	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Mixed in with all the cub scout oath service reviews

EDL	00:34:31,552	00:34:32,576	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	By George Orwell
EDL	00:34:33,088	00:34:36,928	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Kennedy talks about it all the time and speeches 1984
EDL	00:34:38,208	00:34:40,256	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The dictatorship is always surveilling you
EDL	00:34:41,024	00:34:42,560	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Trying to control your thoughts
EDL	00:34:42,560	00:34:44,864	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	You are so friendly
EDL	00:34:44,864	00:34:47,936	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	A1984 has one of the most brilliant themes in literature
EDL	00:34:52,032	00:34:54,080	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The protagonist is being tortured
EDL	00:34:54,080	00:34:55,616	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Chewing the writing you know.
EDL	00:34:55,616	00:34:59,200	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two equals four
EDL	00:35:05,856	00:35:09,184	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I probably can't stand the pressure anymore
EDL	00:35:11,232	00:35:14,560	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Okay to intuos5
EDL	00:35:14,560	00:35:20,704	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	But the torture continues is it why you continually
EDL	00:35:21,216	00:35:22,496	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The torture continued
EDL	00:35:22,496	00:35:24,544	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Not until you just say it but until you believe it
EDL	00:35:27,360	00:35:27,872	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Wichita
EDL	00:35:28,896	00:35:30,944	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Already
EDL	00:35:34,784	00:35:37,088	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	This is
EDL	00:35:37,088	00:35:38,368	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Powerful reminder
EDL	00:35:38,880	00:35:43,232	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The government want to plan your destiny they want to plan what you think
EDL	00:35:43,232	00:35:45,536	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Never happen
EDL	00:35:46,560	00:35:47,328	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	So clearly
EDL	00:35:49,376	00:35:50,400	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Inside
EDL	00:35:50,400	00:35:51,680	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Anthony Kennedy's mind
EDL	00:35:52,704	00:35:56,288	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Maybe this is as close to an ideology as he has he's often talked about as having
EDL	00:35:56,800	00:36:01,152	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Very little discernible ideology will maybe this is it inside his mind
EDL	00:36:01,664	00:36:02,944	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	There is a fear
EDL	00:36:02,944	00:36:03,968	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	A timer

EDL	00:36:18,560	00:36:19,840	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	An idea which is
EDL	00:36:19,840	00:36:20,608	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Central
EDL	00:36:21,120	00:36:22,400	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	To Western thought
EDL	00:36:22,400	00:36:26,240	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	This is how we put it at his Supreme Court confirmation Hearing in 1987
EDL	00:36:26,240	00:36:27,264	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	And that is
EDL	00:36:27,264	00:36:27,776	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	There
EDL	00:36:29,312	00:36:30,592	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Is a zone of Liberty
EDL	00:36:31,360	00:36:32,384	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Arizona protection
EDL	00:36:32,896	00:36:35,200	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	A line that is drawn
EDL	00:36:35,200	00:36:39,040	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Where the individual can tell the government be on this line you may not go
EDL	00:36:41,344	00:36:41,856	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Incel
EDL	00:36:46,208	00:36:47,744	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	To go back to the secret room
EDL	00:36:50,560	00:36:53,120	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	When chief justice Roberts asked Justice Kennedy
EDL	00:36:53,632	00:36:55,168	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Alright Kennedy which way you going to swing
EDL	00:36:55,680	00:36:57,472	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I imagine what he said
EDL	00:36:57,472	00:36:59,776	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Accessing the word imagine is alright Mister chief
EDL	00:37:00,800	00:37:02,336	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I know you think I'm a swinger
EDL	00:37:02,848	00:37:04,896	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I know everybody else thinks I'm a swinger
EDL	00:37:04,896	00:37:05,920	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	But on this issue
EDL	00:37:06,432	00:37:10,784	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I do not swing not only do I think the citizens united has a case
EDL	00:37:10,784	00:37:14,112	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	But I think that campaign Finance law that would limit their speech
EDL	00:37:14,624	00:37:20,768	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Shut down government
EDL	00:37:21,280	00:37:26,144	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Who did parkour and said that it was lawful to ban of book
EDL	00:37:34,848	00:37:39,968	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	We know that two things happened after Kennedy so they gave his answer to Let's Go Big Lots tear it down
EDL	00:37:40,480	00:37:42,528	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	We know that the conservatives on the court were like
EDL	00:37:43,040	00:37:48,160	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I like where you're going with this and they started to gravitate to his side we also know the David souter
EDL	00:37:48,928	00:37:50,208	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	He was the justice
EDL	00:37:50,208	00:37:53,536	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	In court she lie about anything she's deceit
EDL	00:37:53,536	00:37:55,072	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	She's ruthless cunning
EDL	00:37:55,072	00:37:57,632	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Sounds to me like campaign
EDL	00:37:58,144	00:38:00,448	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Who is basically accusing citizens united
EDL	00:38:00,448	00:38:03,008	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Trying to pretend they were playing politics really they were
EDL	00:38:03,520	00:38:05,312	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	We know that Justice souter
EDL	00:38:05,312	00:38:06,080	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Got really pissed
EDL	00:38:06,592	00:38:10,944	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Because if we go into David suitors mind his room within a room
EDL	00:38:11,712	00:38:13,504	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The view is very different
EDL	00:38:15,552	00:38:17,088	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	David souter is a New Englander
EDL	00:38:17,856	00:38:18,624	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Quiet

EDL	00:38:25,792	00:38:31,680	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	This is story that suitors home in New Hampshire was stacked with so many books that his house actually needed a new Foundation
EDL	00:38:32,192	00:38:34,240	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Which is to say his reaction here was
EDL	00:38:34,240	00:38:35,008	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Very out of character
EDL	00:38:35,776	00:38:37,312	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	By all accounts he was not
EDL	00:38:37,312	00:38:42,688	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Happy because Kennedy's whole thing that Liberty is the law nothing should compromise that that for Suitor

EDL	00:53:41,503	00:53:42,015	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	And this is
EDL	00:53:42,527	00:53:43,551	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Frankly
EDL	00:53:43,551	00:53:46,623	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Perfect example of the kind of high-minded principal
EDL	00:53:47,135	00:53:47,647	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	That works
EDL	00:53:48,159	00:53:49,439	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	In reality
EDL	00:53:49,439	00:53:50,719	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Not at all
EDL	00:53:50,719	00:53:55,839	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	No
EDL	00:53:57,119	00:53:57,631	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I mean he's right
EDL	00:53:58,143	00:54:01,471	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	There are disclosure laws but they are really
EDL	00:54:01,471	00:54:02,495	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Really easy to get around
EDL	00:54:03,519	00:54:05,567	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	For example right now I could write
EDL	00:54:05,567	00:54:09,919	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	3 million-dollar check to a 501 C 4 like
EDL	00:54:09,919	00:54:11,199	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Citizens united
EDL	00:54:11,199	00:54:14,783	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Or the NAACP for that matter and they would never have to tell anyone
EDL	00:54:17,343	00:54:18,623	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	That money came for me
EDL	00:54:18,623	00:54:20,415	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	I could just hide in the shadows
EDL	00:54:20,415	00:54:24,255	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	That's why this kind of donations are often called
EDL	00:54:24,767	00:54:27,071	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Now there are people who could change this who can make
EDL	00:54:27,839	00:54:30,911	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Disclosure and actual meaningful
EDL	00:54:30,911	00:54:31,679	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Think
EDL	00:54:31,679	00:54:32,447	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	For example
EDL	00:54:34,495	00:54:40,639	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The FEC is one of those places
EDL	00:54:42,687	00:54:43,967	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	V FEC
EDL	00:54:43,967	00:54:44,479	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Could
EDL	00:54:44,991	00:54:46,783	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Choose to fix all the loopholes
EDL	00:54:46,783	00:54:50,111	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Require that all the money that's coming to politics in the wake of citizens united
EDL	00:54:50,623	00:54:52,671	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	The very least be identified
EDL	00:54:55,487	00:54:57,791	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Is it the FEC is required by law
EDL	00:54:58,303	00:55:01,887	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	To have no more than three Commissioners be a member of
EDL	00:55:01,887	00:55:02,399	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Party
EDL	00:55:03,679	00:55:05,727	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Essentially want there to be balance between Democrats
EDL	00:55:07,007	00:55:09,055	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	And in this day and age what that means
EDL	00:55:09,055	00:55:09,823	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	Is gridlock
EDL	00:55:09,823	00:55:14,687	| moreperfect110217_citizensunited |	So with the idea of strengthening disclosure laws comes up
