EDL	00:00:40,192	00:00:41,984	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Frankfurters claim was
EDL	00:00:41,984	00:00:45,824	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Once the courts are in there will be nothing Beyond it and someday

EDL	00:01:01,440	00:01:05,280	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Essentially the story of a case that many people
EDL	00:01:05,280	00:01:10,144	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Point to as being the first time that the Supreme Court got into politics
EDL	00:01:10,144	00:01:12,192	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Text with soiled themselves with politics
EDL	00:01:12,192	00:01:12,704	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Switch
EDL	00:01:13,216	00:01:16,032	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Make a beeline from that moment to Bush V Gore
EDL	00:01:16,544	00:01:17,568	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	That case
EDL	00:01:17,568	00:01:18,592	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	1962
EDL	00:01:19,104	00:01:20,128	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So dramatic
EDL	00:01:20,640	00:01:23,200	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	For a court that too
EDL	00:01:23,200	00:01:24,736	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Literally broke
EDL	00:01:24,736	00:01:25,248	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	To Justice
EDL	00:01:26,016	00:01:27,040	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The shattered
EDL	00:01:27,040	00:01:27,808	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	2 human being
EDL	00:01:28,576	00:01:30,112	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And one of those two justices
EDL	00:01:30,624	00:01:32,160	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Justice Felix Frankfurter
EDL	00:01:32,672	00:01:35,232	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Is at the center of the mystery we're about to tell you about
EDL	00:01:35,744	00:01:37,792	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Just to give you a sense of who he was
EDL	00:01:37,792	00:01:40,096	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Play you a little clip from that earlier story
EDL	00:01:40,608	00:01:44,960	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	He was extremely smart towering figure but as a person
EDL	00:01:45,472	00:01:46,240	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Justice
EDL	00:01:47,008	00:01:48,032	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Justice Frankfurter
EDL	00:01:49,824	00:01:51,360	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	He wasn't necessarily
EDL	00:01:51,360	00:01:52,384	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The nicest
EDL	00:01:52,384	00:01:54,176	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Person I heard that from everyone I talk
EDL	00:01:54,688	00:01:56,480	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I always call him a Bantam rooster
EDL	00:01:56,480	00:01:59,808	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	He was a difficult Krusty figure
EDL	00:02:00,320	00:02:01,600	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	A little bit of a pouch
EDL	00:02:02,112	00:02:03,392	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Was one of the most
EDL	00:02:03,392	00:02:05,696	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Condescending egotistical of just
EDL	00:02:05,696	00:02:06,208	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	It says
EDL	00:02:06,976	00:02:10,048	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So Justice Felix Frankfurter not the nicest guy but
EDL	00:02:10,816	00:02:11,584	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Important
EDL	00:02:11,584	00:02:15,680	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Presided over a ton of really important cases like for example
EDL	00:02:15,680	00:02:16,960	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Brown V Board of Education
EDL	00:02:17,472	00:02:17,984	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Big one
EDL	00:02:19,264	00:02:22,592	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Being the slow March towards desegregating our school system
EDL	00:02:23,360	00:02:26,688	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Any of the mystery today deals with his papers
EDL	00:02:27,456	00:02:31,040	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	These are the notes that you took while he was on the bench you know
EDL	00:02:31,552	00:02:37,696	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Drafts of decisions that he wrote the Scentsy Road a memos back and forth with the other justices
EDL	00:02:38,464	00:02:43,328	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Maybe the notes you took when they were all in that secret conference room that they go to when they're arguing
EDL	00:02:43,328	00:02:48,192	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Got stuff to like people like us are like a man we got to get those paper
EDL	00:02:48,192	00:02:49,728	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But in this case

EDL	00:02:52,288	00:02:53,056	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Which brings us to
EDL	00:02:53,568	00:02:56,384	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The story of one of the biggest
EDL	00:02:56,384	00:02:57,152	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Heists
EDL	00:02:57,152	00:02:59,200	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	In Supreme Court history

EDL	00:03:30,688	00:03:32,480	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	In such an ecosystem where
EDL	00:03:32,480	00:03:34,016	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	It's so hard to gain access
EDL	00:03:34,528	00:03:36,064	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	To these papers to these documents
EDL	00:03:36,832	00:03:38,880	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	At some point someone might try

EDL	00:04:17,024	00:04:18,559	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	If I do not have gas
EDL	00:04:18,559	00:04:20,351	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	That it was a papers of Felix Frankfurter
EDL	00:04:20,863	00:04:23,167	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	More than a thousand pages
EDL	00:04:23,167	00:04:26,239	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	A Frank for his papers were stolen from the Library of Congress
EDL	00:04:26,751	00:04:30,335	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	An early 1970s they have never been recovered.
EDL	00:04:30,335	00:04:31,103	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Single page of them
EDL	00:04:31,615	00:04:32,895	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	It was a
EDL	00:04:33,407	00:04:35,455	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Kind of extraordinary Heist
EDL	00:04:35,967	00:04:41,087	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	It was investigated by the FBI they had a prime suspect they can be know how there was a grand jury called
EDL	00:04:42,367	00:04:45,951	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Extensive investigation involved the nation's leading journalist
EDL	00:04:46,463	00:04:50,559	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Involve other members of the Court the nation's leading legal Scholars
EDL	00:04:50,559	00:04:53,631	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	We're questioned and were part of the investigation
EDL	00:04:53,631	00:04:54,911	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The whole thing unravels
EDL	00:04:56,191	00:04:57,215	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Days
EDL	00:04:57,215	00:04:57,983	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Hours
EDL	00:04:57,983	00:05:01,055	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Before the Saturday night Massacre and the
EDL	00:05:01,055	00:05:03,359	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Explosion of Watergate
EDL	00:05:03,871	00:05:05,407	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And was quickly forgotten
EDL	00:05:06,687	00:05:11,295	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Does all of this this immense personality this historic figure
EDL	00:05:11,295	00:05:17,695	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Did this plan to why it was his papers that were stolen or were they just the ones that were in the library the right time for
EDL	00:05:17,695	00:05:21,023	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Someone to steal yeah I don't think we know that unless the
EDL	00:05:21,023	00:05:22,815	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Mystery really solved
EDL	00:05:22,815	00:05:24,607	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And I feel like I got so
EDL	00:05:24,607	00:05:25,119	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Close
EDL	00:05:25,631	00:05:28,959	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	What did you mean what what didn't you have to put it all together
EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:30,239	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Can you reveal that
EDL	00:05:30,751	00:05:31,519	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I guess
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:33,567	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	We think about it
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:34,847	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	We're trying to solve a staff
EDL	00:05:35,615	00:05:37,919	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	You need to know the motive of the thief
EDL	00:05:38,431	00:05:41,503	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And to know the mode of the thief you need to know what was stolen
EDL	00:05:42,527	00:05:44,063	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But in frankfurters
EDL	00:05:44,063	00:05:44,831	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Case
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:48,671	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	His papers and only really just got to the Library of Congress
EDL	00:05:49,439	00:05:52,767	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So when the papers disappeared for a long time nobody even notices
EDL	00:05:53,791	00:05:59,679	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I'm really proud of the nation probably have been letting people look at them because it's then you can start to reconstruct with Missy
EDL	00:06:00,447	00:06:04,287	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	What's clear from what was missing of these more than a thousand pages
EDL	00:06:05,567	00:06:06,847	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Is that it was the best stuff
EDL	00:06:07,359	00:06:11,455	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And so one theory that the FBI had early on was
EDL	00:06:11,455	00:06:13,247	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I was trying to make money cuz you could like
EDL	00:06:13,759	00:06:16,063	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	All of it frankfurters corresponds with Lyndon Johnson
EDL	00:06:16,831	00:06:17,599	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Princeton
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:20,927	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Was missing as presidential signature
EDL	00:06:20,927	00:06:25,023	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	You could sell that I mean where you going to sell these things another question but like maybe that that's the case
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:28,607	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The next theory that the library working with the FBI
EDL	00:06:29,119	00:06:29,631	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So
EDL	00:06:30,399	00:06:31,423	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	It's a scholar
EDL	00:06:33,471	00:06:34,495	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And a scholar who just
EDL	00:06:35,007	00:06:35,519	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Cool
EDL	00:06:37,823	00:06:39,871	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Mike wants to have this stuff
EDL	00:06:40,895	00:06:42,175	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And doesn't want anybody else to
EDL	00:06:42,943	00:06:44,479	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Like a fanatic like a collector
EDL	00:06:44,991	00:06:46,527	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Lego yeah Lego just

EDL	00:07:12,127	00:07:17,503	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	You don't like something to treat me like I'm going to write a biography of Frankfort and this is how I'm going to sell it
EDL	00:07:17,503	00:07:20,831	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The last thing you would want would be for another scholar
EDL	00:07:20,831	00:07:24,415	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I have finding the archives all the time like

EDL	00:07:39,007	00:07:40,799	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	A journalist if we can imagine
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:44,639	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Are you just can't resist and it was new security
EDL	00:07:44,639	00:07:45,151	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The library
EDL	00:07:46,431	00:07:49,759	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I thought I interviewed everybody was investigated by the FBI
EDL	00:07:49,759	00:07:51,551	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I need these Larry stars that like yeah
EDL	00:07:51,551	00:07:53,855	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I have photo copy Xerox machine
EDL	00:07:53,855	00:07:55,391	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Early xerox machine
EDL	00:07:55,903	00:07:58,719	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And you'd like put a nickel in it but they would just let you take
EDL	00:07:58,719	00:07:59,999	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Folders download
EDL	00:07:59,999	00:08:06,399	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Down the hall and episode of stairs and through double doors and go to the bathroom at the back door of the bathroom and there was this one xerox machine
EDL	00:08:06,399	00:08:07,167	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	You can put a nickel in
EDL	00:08:07,679	00:08:09,983	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And you just walked out the door with your folders
EDL	00:08:11,007	00:08:14,335	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	You can't do that. Anywhere
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:17,407	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And it was this case it actually led to a cracked
EDL	00:08:18,175	00:08:18,687	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So
EDL	00:08:19,199	00:08:21,247	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The FBI quickly came to the
EDL	00:08:21,247	00:08:22,271	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Conclusion that
EDL	00:08:23,039	00:08:23,807	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Whoever
EDL	00:08:24,575	00:08:28,415	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Had bothered to do the incredible labor of stealing all those paper
EDL	00:08:28,415	00:08:29,183	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	There's a lot of smoke
EDL	00:08:30,207	00:08:33,535	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Women someone who both really wanted to write about Frankfurter
EDL	00:08:33,535	00:08:35,583	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Had found something incredibly juicy
EDL	00:08:36,351	00:08:38,399	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But had been forwarded
EDL	00:08:38,399	00:08:38,911	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Bye
EDL	00:08:39,423	00:08:39,935	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The kind of
EDL	00:08:40,703	00:08:41,983	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Cabal of Frankfurter
EDL	00:08:43,775	00:08:47,103	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	These people are called the hot dogs
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:55,807	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	They really are sitting by the campfire now it's on the hot dogs go on the
EDL	00:08:56,319	00:08:57,087	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	We've been
EDL	00:08:57,087	00:08:58,623	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Sharpening of wooden stick
EDL	00:08:58,623	00:08:59,903	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Star green wooden sticks
EDL	00:09:00,671	00:09:02,719	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Now you put on the hot dogs and roast them
EDL	00:09:03,231	00:09:05,279	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The hot dogs are the former Clerks of Frankfort
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:08,607	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	They are known as hot dogs and they loved him
EDL	00:09:08,607	00:09:11,935	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Because like many an ornery person you know apparently was
EDL	00:09:11,935	00:09:13,727	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Very stand-up person to work with
EDL	00:09:16,031	00:09:18,079	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And they were so kind of protecting his legacy
EDL	00:09:18,847	00:09:23,199	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Anyway so that the case is kind of just gets steamrolled by Watergate
EDL	00:09:23,199	00:09:23,711	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:27,807	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	This is kind of like the Alex Jones theory of the Felix rings
EDL	00:09:34,207	00:09:36,511	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Diligent legal Scholars
EDL	00:09:36,511	00:09:39,071	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Is this the story together
EDL	00:09:39,583	00:09:41,887	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And I
EDL	00:09:41,887	00:09:46,239	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	It's a little conspiracy theory minded but it's not Beyond The Pale
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,311	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So one of the pieces of paper that
EDL	00:09:49,823	00:09:51,359	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Appears to have been missing from
EDL	00:09:51,359	00:09:51,871	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Frankfurters
EDL	00:09:54,175	00:09:55,199	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Is really interesting
EDL	00:09:55,711	00:09:58,015	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And was potentially quite damaging
EDL	00:09:58,527	00:09:59,551	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	To William
EDL	00:09:59,551	00:10:00,319	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Brink
EDL	00:10:00,319	00:10:02,111	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Who had been nominated to serve on the
EDL	00:10:02,879	00:10:03,647	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And who's
EDL	00:10:05,183	00:10:06,463	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Confirmation
EDL	00:10:06,463	00:10:09,023	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Proceedings were happening right at the time
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:10,303	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The frankfurters papers
EDL	00:10:11,327	00:10:11,839	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Rancho
EDL	00:10:13,119	00:10:14,655	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	What was controversial
EDL	00:10:14,655	00:10:15,423	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	4
EDL	00:10:15,423	00:10:15,935	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Rehnquist
EDL	00:10:16,703	00:10:17,215	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Was
EDL	00:10:17,983	00:10:21,055	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The issue that had forwarded Nixon's earlier
EDL	00:10:22,079	00:10:22,847	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Judicial appointments
EDL	00:10:23,615	00:10:25,151	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Which was his relationship
EDL	00:10:25,151	00:10:25,919	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Desegregation
EDL	00:10:25,919	00:10:27,967	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Nixon who will recall
EDL	00:10:27,967	00:10:30,015	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Pursuing the southern strategy trying to woo
EDL	00:10:30,527	00:10:31,807	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	White Southern Democrats
EDL	00:10:32,575	00:10:37,183	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I nominated some potential justices who were segregation especially had been segregationist earlier
EDL	00:10:37,951	00:10:42,815	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Frank was not but rank was served as a clerk for Robert Jackson in 1950s
EDL	00:10:42,815	00:10:45,887	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And asked by Jackson to prepare a memo about Brown V board
EDL	00:10:46,399	00:10:48,447	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Rent Pacific Mo on Richey Road
EDL	00:10:48,447	00:10:50,495	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I realize it is an unpopular
EDL	00:10:50,495	00:10:52,287	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	A nun humanitarian position
EDL	00:10:52,287	00:10:54,847	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	For which I have been excoriated by liberal colleagues
EDL	00:10:55,359	00:10:57,663	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But I think Plessy V Ferguson was right
EDL	00:10:57,663	00:11:01,759	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I should be reaffirmed Plessy V Ferguson 1896
EDL	00:11:01,759	00:11:06,111	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Decision legal principle of separate but equal
EDL	00:11:06,879	00:11:09,439	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	This is not Jim Crow legalize this is mentioned
EDL	00:11:10,463	00:11:11,743	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And so it's probably
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:14,303	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	You know in Newsweek and didn't read the comics
EDL	00:11:14,303	00:11:17,119	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Blue Savannah real big problem for wrinkles during his confirmation
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:20,703	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Drink with work very hard
EDL	00:11:21,215	00:11:21,983	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Too quiet that's
EDL	00:11:22,495	00:11:23,007	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	He said
EDL	00:11:24,031	00:11:25,823	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I wasn't expressing my own views
EDL	00:11:25,823	00:11:28,127	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I was asked to write a memo about
EDL	00:11:28,639	00:11:29,663	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Justice Jackson's
EDL	00:11:31,967	00:11:32,991	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Ann Jackson

EDL	00:11:35,807	00:11:37,343	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	She told reporters
EDL	00:11:37,343	00:11:38,623	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	That's just a lie
EDL	00:11:38,623	00:11:40,671	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Mike Jenkins and ask his clerks to write
EDL	00:11:41,183	00:11:45,791	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Down memos about what Jackson should think Jackson Hewitt he thought he has his Clerks
EDL	00:11:45,791	00:11:47,583	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	To tell him what they thought
EDL	00:11:47,583	00:11:48,095	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So he could
EDL	00:11:48,607	00:11:51,167	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Alli Breen if you could come to liberate on the most
EDL	00:11:51,167	00:11:52,447	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Positions that they would present him with
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:56,287	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So when was the send a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee tried to
EDL	00:11:56,287	00:11:57,311	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Explain all of this
EDL	00:11:57,823	00:11:59,615	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Senate Judiciary Committee threatens to hold
EDL	00:12:00,127	00:12:03,967	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Hearings over the holiday or after Christmas is December of 1971
EDL	00:12:06,015	00:12:09,087	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Nixon start putting pressure on senators
EDL	00:12:10,367	00:12:11,391	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And you can imagine
EDL	00:12:11,903	00:12:13,439	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Somebody at this point might have thought
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,231	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I wonder
EDL	00:12:15,231	00:12:20,095	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Was anything in frankfurters papers Witcher huge winter just been given to the recently given to the Library of Congress

EDL	00:12:23,423	00:12:29,823	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And one of the things that is no longer in frankfurters papers but appears to have been before the law
EDL	00:12:29,823	00:12:30,591	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	What does theft
EDL	00:12:30,591	00:12:33,919	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Is a letter that rank was wrote to Frankfurter in 1955
EDL	00:12:34,687	00:12:35,711	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	On the question of
EDL	00:12:35,711	00:12:39,295	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Segregation in the memo to Jackson Western 1952
EDL	00:12:40,575	00:12:45,183	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And there's two legal Scholars Brad Schneider and John Barrett who argue that

EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:48,511	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	They made and I can
EDL	00:12:48,511	00:12:50,559	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	52 in that letter to Frankfurter and it
EDL	00:12:50,559	00:12:56,703	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Someone from the FBI or from the Nixon white house or on the White House plumbers
EDL	00:12:57,727	00:13:04,127	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Could have been told by Nixon by hausermann by United is Jokers
EDL	00:13:04,127	00:13:09,759	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Can you set up the gear I don't live in Congress and pull anything from ringquist from frankfurters papers but the Hydra tracks
EDL	00:13:10,271	00:13:11,807	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Take a bunch of that crap out
EDL	00:13:11,807	00:13:17,183	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	We want to make it look like someone actually stole frankfurters papers like as if anybody can't you donate
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:23,583	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	My daddy was the whole thing was yet another Watergate cover-up he know we had another dirty trick

EDL	00:13:35,103	00:13:36,639	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Do you think it could have been just some nebbish

EDL	00:13:43,295	00:13:45,855	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Termite evidence for that theory
EDL	00:13:45,855	00:13:47,647	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I can't tell you that theory
EDL	00:13:49,439	00:13:50,463	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:54,047	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	In a theory we are disappointed to learn
EDL	00:13:54,047	00:13:55,839	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	That it is very unlikely that the paper still
EDL	00:13:57,119	00:13:58,911	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The FBI had a prime suspect
EDL	00:13:58,911	00:14:01,471	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Yahoo denied any involvement and
EDL	00:14:01,471	00:14:05,311	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Did not accept an offer for kind of animosity in exchange for turning the papers
EDL	00:14:05,823	00:14:07,103	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So although you know
EDL	00:14:07,871	00:14:09,663	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	They tended to believe that
EDL	00:14:09,663	00:14:12,223	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	That person probably had the papers
EDL	00:14:12,223	00:14:12,991	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The FBI never made it
EDL	00:14:13,759	00:14:14,783	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	BFDI apps
EDL	00:14:14,783	00:14:15,807	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	We never made an arrest
EDL	00:14:15,807	00:14:17,087	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	An 8-day talk to a lot of people
EDL	00:14:17,599	00:14:19,647	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	They did they did take the investigation really Siri
EDL	00:14:20,415	00:14:22,207	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But on the other hand
EDL	00:14:22,207	00:14:23,743	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	If the FBI had
EDL	00:14:23,743	00:14:30,143	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Conducted the highest in the first place wouldn't their investigation have been just designed to cover up that they were the
EDL	00:14:30,143	00:14:36,287	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Culprit would have to be thorough yeah right I mean you're not going to be like the Library of Congress calls in Frankfurt his papers and missing be like they were too busy
EDL	00:14:36,799	00:14:37,567	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Because
EDL	00:14:37,567	00:14:40,639	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	That that would look very suspicious if they taking them
EDL	00:14:41,151	00:14:44,479	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I love that. Anything fun Theory
EDL	00:14:44,479	00:14:45,759	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Explains a lot
EDL	00:14:45,759	00:14:49,599	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	It's just very little evidence I'm just going to be completely clear
EDL	00:14:50,111	00:14:54,463	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Evidence for what's a sheet of the timeline works out just a little bit like
EDL	00:14:55,999	00:14:59,071	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	You know the New York Times published a timeline of the kind of
EDL	00:14:59,583	00:15:01,631	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Well this is the day that Donald Trump jr. net worth
EDL	00:15:02,143	00:15:08,287	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Natalya and then this is the day that Wikileaks published the timeline lines of beautiful
EDL	00:15:08,799	00:15:09,567	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But that is not enough
EDL	00:15:19,807	00:15:20,319	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Coming up
EDL	00:15:21,343	00:15:23,391	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Step back and ask how the world did this
EDL	00:15:23,391	00:15:25,695	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	How could this happen
EDL	00:15:26,463	00:15:29,791	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Who gets to decide what happens to these court papers this
EDL	00:15:29,791	00:15:30,303	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Betta fish
EDL	00:15:31,583	00:15:32,351	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	That's coming up
EDL	00:15:37,471	00:15:40,543	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	It's more perfect time Jedi will ride back to our conversation
EDL	00:15:41,055	00:15:41,823	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	With
EDL	00:15:41,823	00:15:46,943	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Imperfect producer Sean rameswaram and Harvard historian and New Yorker staff writer Jill Lepore
EDL	00:15:47,967	00:15:53,855	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So so what's the Supreme Court's official policy and all the papers that go to the Supreme Court what do they do with all that stuff
EDL	00:15:53,855	00:15:56,671	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The Supreme Court's official policy is it is none of your business
EDL	00:15:57,695	00:16:00,767	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	It's very surprised myself was frankly surprised to discover this
EDL	00:16:01,535	00:16:05,631	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	That the national records act presidential records act legislation that
EDL	00:16:06,143	00:16:06,911	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Protects
EDL	00:16:07,935	00:16:08,703	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Other
EDL	00:16:08,703	00:16:09,471	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Papers
EDL	00:16:09,471	00:16:10,495	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Of the federal government
EDL	00:16:11,263	00:16:13,567	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Specifically excludes the Supreme Court
EDL	00:16:13,567	00:16:17,919	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So what happens is completely up to the justices including most importantly
EDL	00:16:18,431	00:16:19,967	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The discussions that the judges
EDL	00:16:20,479	00:16:21,759	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Have
EDL	00:16:21,759	00:16:22,527	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Conference
EDL	00:16:22,527	00:16:25,087	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And their notes from those discussions and the
EDL	00:16:25,087	00:16:27,391	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Papers at their clerks a symbol for them
EDL	00:16:27,391	00:16:28,671	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I'm preparing how to
EDL	00:16:28,671	00:16:29,951	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Consider a case or
EDL	00:16:30,463	00:16:31,487	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Preparing
EDL	00:16:31,487	00:16:32,767	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	For a case that they decide
EDL	00:16:33,279	00:16:34,047	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Not to consider
EDL	00:16:34,559	00:16:36,351	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	It's completely the discretion of the just
EDL	00:16:36,351	00:16:39,167	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Sweater to preserve that for the future for historians
EDL	00:16:39,935	00:16:42,239	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	For the public for that matter after journalists
EDL	00:16:42,751	00:16:45,311	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	They could destroy the land they often do
EDL	00:16:45,311	00:16:51,711	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And how far back does the state he goes back to John Marshall he was one of the most important chief justice
EDL	00:16:51,711	00:16:52,479	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	This is
EDL	00:16:52,479	00:16:54,783	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Marshall was an incredibly effective leader of the cord
EDL	00:16:55,295	00:16:56,831	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But under his
EDL	00:16:56,831	00:16:58,623	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Can you record gained an enormous amount of
EDL	00:16:59,391	00:17:01,183	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But she really believed that
EDL	00:17:01,183	00:17:01,951	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	4
EDL	00:17:01,951	00:17:02,975	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The justices
EDL	00:17:03,743	00:17:05,279	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	To be able to confer
EDL	00:17:05,791	00:17:07,327	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	With full candor
EDL	00:17:08,095	00:17:10,143	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Their deliberations needed to be
EDL	00:17:10,655	00:17:11,423	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Secret
EDL	00:17:11,423	00:17:12,447	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	In perpetuity
EDL	00:17:12,447	00:17:16,031	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	A lot of people that I'm opposed to Jefferson in particular that was completely inexcusable
EDL	00:17:16,031	00:17:19,615	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Really important value in a republic is transparency
EDL	00:17:19,615	00:17:20,895	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	And Marshall was essentially mean
EDL	00:17:21,663	00:17:23,967	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I mean that he loved the idea of the Mist
EDL	00:17:24,991	00:17:28,319	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Courtney in the Mystique of the Core Music reserve of power
EDL	00:17:29,087	00:17:30,111	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	So
EDL	00:17:30,111	00:17:35,231	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The tradition dates for Marshall and India are very strong arguments to be made in favor of the deliberations
EDL	00:17:35,999	00:17:37,279	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Being kept secret I think
EDL	00:17:37,279	00:17:38,047	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Certainly for
EDL	00:17:38,047	00:17:38,815	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Period of time
EDL	00:17:39,839	00:17:41,631	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But that we should never know
EDL	00:17:41,631	00:17:43,679	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	What was behind these decisions
EDL	00:17:44,191	00:17:44,959	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Who's I think
EDL	00:17:45,983	00:17:47,519	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	From the Vantage of a historian
EDL	00:17:48,031	00:17:50,079	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Athletic tape
EDL	00:17:51,359	00:17:55,967	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Book from the political principle that they're strong and it's on the other side
EDL	00:17:55,967	00:17:58,783	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The strong argument to be made that this is indefensible
EDL	00:17:59,295	00:18:00,063	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	First of all
EDL	00:18:00,063	00:18:01,343	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	They can decide to save nothing
EDL	00:18:01,855	00:18:02,623	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	They can burn that paper
EDL	00:18:03,903	00:18:05,695	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	New small number of them have indeed
EDL	00:18:06,719	00:18:07,999	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Second they can
EDL	00:18:07,999	00:18:09,279	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Decide they're going to
EDL	00:18:09,279	00:18:10,047	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Give the papers to an R
EDL	00:18:10,559	00:18:14,143	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Then they can give a tenant to a really inconvenient archive
EDL	00:18:14,143	00:18:18,495	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	What's 8 as a rule in this nine justices you want to meet you there
EDL	00:18:19,519	00:18:20,031	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Conference notes
EDL	00:18:21,055	00:18:23,871	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I see the paper folders that they assemble the papers about the
EDL	00:18:23,871	00:18:24,383	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The case
EDL	00:18:24,895	00:18:27,711	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	You could very well have to go to mini farfan places which
EDL	00:18:28,735	00:18:30,527	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Doesn't seem maybe that inconvenient
EDL	00:18:30,527	00:18:31,807	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Maybe to your listeners but
EDL	00:18:32,319	00:18:36,671	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Is it hard work being trained and getting enough money to even get to these places are
EDL	00:18:37,183	00:18:39,743	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But these are the people who's in
EDL	00:18:39,743	00:18:41,279	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Career has been spent
EDL	00:18:41,279	00:18:43,071	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Pay by taxpayer
EDL	00:18:43,071	00:18:43,583	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Funds
EDL	00:18:44,095	00:18:44,863	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	To do the work
EDL	00:18:45,631	00:18:46,399	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Of the federal government
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,447	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Indeed
EDL	00:18:48,447	00:18:51,519	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Portion of their papers that concerns the work they did for the federal government
EDL	00:18:52,543	00:18:54,335	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	A lot of people might say
EDL	00:18:54,335	00:18:55,359	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Belongs to the public
EDL	00:18:56,127	00:18:58,943	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	My own view is it is indefensible that the court has no power
EDL	00:18:58,943	00:18:59,967	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I'll see with her guard
EDL	00:18:59,967	00:19:02,015	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	2 Court related papers of its justices
EDL	00:19:03,039	00:19:04,319	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Their rules people
EDL	00:19:04,319	00:19:07,391	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	These people can't set a rule for themselves, but I understand they don't want
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:11,487	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Congress sitting rule about it that for them that falls under the separation of powers issue
EDL	00:19:12,255	00:19:14,559	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	But they should have the rule on the rule just shouldn't be
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:15,583	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	You can have your kids
EDL	00:19:15,583	00:19:16,095	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Decide to burn off
EDL	00:19:17,631	00:19:19,423	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	What do you think it would take
EDL	00:19:19,423	00:19:21,983	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	For such a rule at this point to be passed
EDL	00:19:21,983	00:19:23,263	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I would have thought
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:24,031	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Honestly
EDL	00:19:24,031	00:19:26,335	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	They did might have come in the ass for math of the
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:27,615	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Bush V Gore decision in two
EDL	00:19:28,383	00:19:29,919	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	When people might have said you know what
EDL	00:19:30,431	00:19:31,967	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Supreme Court really powerful
EDL	00:19:31,967	00:19:33,759	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	In an era of judicial Supremacy
EDL	00:19:34,271	00:19:36,831	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	We actually need the Supreme Court to be saving
EDL	00:19:37,343	00:19:40,159	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Papers because future Generations need to understand
EDL	00:19:40,159	00:19:42,975	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	By what means did those nine people
EDL	00:19:42,975	00:19:43,487	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Come to that
EDL	00:19:49,631	00:19:51,423	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	If you could steal
EDL	00:19:51,423	00:19:54,751	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	The papers of any Supreme Court Justice living or dead
EDL	00:19:54,751	00:19:55,775	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Or Justino
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:20:01,919	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Borrow for a weekend to pour over whose would you steal
EDL	00:20:04,991	00:20:07,551	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	I'm I'm going to just go for the gold here
EDL	00:20:08,063	00:20:08,831	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	John Marshall
EDL	00:20:09,343	00:20:10,111	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Classic
EDL	00:20:10,111	00:20:11,903	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	Yeah just be kind of original guy
EDL	00:20:12,671	00:20:14,463	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	He was Jefferson's cousin
EDL	00:20:14,463	00:20:15,743	| moreperfect101617_theheist |	He served on the bench with
