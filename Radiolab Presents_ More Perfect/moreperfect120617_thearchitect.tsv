EDL	00:04:45,439	00:04:47,743	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	A little less liberal than he was before
EDL	00:04:49,279	00:04:55,423	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And you got married and then in the early 80s he's living in Houston working as a stockbroker
EDL	00:04:57,471	00:04:57,983	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And

EDL	00:05:28,959	00:05:29,983	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	New York liberals
EDL	00:05:29,983	00:05:30,751	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Defecting
EDL	00:05:31,263	00:05:31,775	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Is what he says
EDL	00:05:32,287	00:05:32,799	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Thousand
EDL	00:05:33,567	00:05:35,359	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Individuals who grew up in the night
EDL	00:05:35,359	00:05:36,127	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	1960s
EDL	00:05:36,127	00:05:37,151	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	It started to question
EDL	00:05:38,175	00:05:38,687	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The Wiz
EDL	00:05:39,199	00:05:39,967	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Obviously
EDL	00:05:39,967	00:05:40,735	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Liberal policies
EDL	00:05:41,247	00:05:42,783	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And he says slowly
EDL	00:05:43,295	00:05:44,319	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Overtime
EDL	00:05:44,319	00:05:44,831	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Very
EDL	00:05:45,343	00:05:45,855	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Gradual
EDL	00:05:46,367	00:05:47,135	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	He became one of those people
EDL	00:05:48,927	00:05:49,695	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	In any case
EDL	00:05:49,695	00:05:54,303	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Fast forward a little bit he's living in Houston Garden variety
EDL	00:05:54,303	00:05:55,327	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Existence
EDL	00:05:55,327	00:05:56,095	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And
EDL	00:05:56,095	00:05:59,167	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Something happens that sends him on this entirely New Path
EDL	00:05:59,679	00:06:02,239	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Basically he and his wife moved to a new neighborhood
EDL	00:06:02,239	00:06:05,055	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	They move from the suburbs into the downtown area
EDL	00:06:05,055	00:06:06,591	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Urban and
EDL	00:06:06,591	00:06:07,871	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	In 1990
EDL	00:06:09,151	00:06:10,687	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	We went to vote
EDL	00:06:10,687	00:06:12,735	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	For the first time in our new neighborhood
EDL	00:06:14,015	00:06:17,599	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I realized that the Republican Party had not
EDL	00:06:17,599	00:06:19,391	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Fielded a candidate
EDL	00:06:19,391	00:06:21,439	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	To oppose the Democrat
EDL	00:06:21,439	00:06:22,207	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Incumbent
EDL	00:06:22,207	00:06:24,255	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Running for congress this is a
EDL	00:06:24,255	00:06:25,023	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	District that has
EDL	00:06:25,535	00:06:27,839	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Almost 600 thousand people
EDL	00:06:29,631	00:06:33,727	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You don't have a choice you've only got one person running
EDL	00:06:33,727	00:06:36,031	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Bloom decided to run himself
EDL	00:06:36,031	00:06:37,055	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I lost item
EDL	00:06:37,567	00:06:39,359	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	No great surprise to anyone
EDL	00:06:39,359	00:06:40,639	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	He actually lost by 32 point
EDL	00:06:41,151	00:06:44,735	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	But along the way something really unusual happen
EDL	00:06:45,247	00:06:51,647	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	During that campaign he and his wife Lark you know they decided they were going to go meet voters in there.
EDL	00:06:51,647	00:06:53,695	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	They got a giant print out
EDL	00:06:53,695	00:07:00,095	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Of all the addresses in the 18th congressional district
EDL	00:07:00,095	00:07:03,423	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Started going door-to-door meeting people handing out literature
EDL	00:07:03,423	00:07:06,751	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And I'd walk down say Oak Street take
EDL	00:07:07,263	00:07:10,335	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The even side of Oak Street
EDL	00:07:10,335	00:07:15,455	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And my wife would take the odd-numbered side of Oak Street
EDL	00:07:15,455	00:07:21,599	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And we would start to walk and very quickly they realized that
EDL	00:07:22,111	00:07:23,391	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The district shape
EDL	00:07:23,903	00:07:24,671	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Was funny
EDL	00:07:25,183	00:07:29,535	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Some houses on one side of the street would be in the district in the house is on the other side wouldn't
EDL	00:07:29,535	00:07:31,327	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Sometimes the district would

EDL	00:07:33,887	00:07:34,911	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Come back at it just
EDL	00:07:35,423	00:07:41,823	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Didn't make sense of this is large bloom wife of Edward Bloom this peculiar because we had
EDL	00:07:41,823	00:07:43,871	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Maps we had to follow
EDL	00:07:43,871	00:07:47,199	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And it was very odd the way some streets were
EDL	00:07:47,711	00:07:49,503	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And the districts in somewhere
EDL	00:07:49,503	00:07:55,647	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Took a while for it all to really sinking as to how this could happen I guess a better week of this
EDL	00:07:55,647	00:07:57,695	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	We realized that
EDL	00:07:57,695	00:07:58,975	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Neighbors
EDL	00:07:58,975	00:08:02,047	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Had been separated
EDL	00:08:02,047	00:08:06,399	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Almost house by house because of their race
EDL	00:08:09,471	00:08:11,775	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You come to believe that the reason this was done
EDL	00:08:11,775	00:08:12,543	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Was
EDL	00:08:12,543	00:08:14,847	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	For the explicit purpose to create a majority
EDL	00:08:14,847	00:08:15,359	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	African American
EDL	00:08:18,687	00:08:21,503	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	This is an untrue
EDL	00:08:22,015	00:08:28,159	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Clothes from a clear and simple wrong part of the reason this was done was the Voting Rights Act of nineteen
EDL	00:08:29,695	00:08:31,999	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Of Americans are denied
EDL	00:08:32,511	00:08:35,583	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The right to vote because of their color
EDL	00:08:35,583	00:08:41,983	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	This act was a giant step forward in civil rights one of the primary
EDL	00:08:41,983	00:08:46,079	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Eliminate barriers to voting like poll taxes and literacy tests
EDL	00:08:46,591	00:08:48,895	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Strategies that have been used to keep minorities
EDL	00:08:48,895	00:08:49,663	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Facebook voting
EDL	00:08:49,663	00:08:51,455	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And the other thing it did
EDL	00:08:51,455	00:08:55,551	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Sort of in a roundabout way through a series of interpretations is
EDL	00:08:56,063	00:08:59,647	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Encourage the creation of districts where the majority of Voters
EDL	00:09:00,159	00:09:01,951	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Were minorities and that's because
EDL	00:09:02,463	00:09:05,535	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	One of the strategies that have been used previously to
EDL	00:09:06,559	00:09:11,423	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Dilute the minority was to take minority communities and
EDL	00:09:11,423	00:09:12,959	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	They call it cracking later
EDL	00:09:12,959	00:09:15,007	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	They split them apart into many different discs
EDL	00:09:15,775	00:09:17,055	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	So that they were never
EDL	00:09:18,079	00:09:19,103	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	In the majority enough
EDL	00:09:19,103	00:09:19,871	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Electorate
EDL	00:09:19,871	00:09:22,943	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	So the Voting Rights Act tried to correct that
EDL	00:09:24,223	00:09:28,319	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The 18th congressional district was one of these majority-minority District
EDL	00:09:28,831	00:09:29,343	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The district
EDL	00:09:29,855	00:09:31,391	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Ron by the Texas
EDL	00:09:32,671	00:09:33,951	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I do have a slight
EDL	00:09:33,951	00:09:35,743	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	African American majority
EDL	00:09:35,743	00:09:38,303	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I think about 51% African American
EDL	00:09:38,303	00:09:42,143	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	But this was the problem according to bloom the way they got to that
EDL	00:09:42,143	00:09:43,935	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	African American majority was by
EDL	00:09:43,935	00:09:47,263	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Creating this District that zigzagged all over the city and cut through neighbor
EDL	00:09:47,263	00:09:49,567	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I could not understand
EDL	00:09:49,567	00:09:54,943	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	People live close together they could send their kids to the neighborhood schools they shopped in the neighborhood
EDL	00:09:54,943	00:09:57,247	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Shopping centers they were worried about
EDL	00:09:57,247	00:09:58,271	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Neighborhood issue
EDL	00:09:59,039	00:10:00,831	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Brixies neighborhoods
EDL	00:10:00,831	00:10:01,855	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Heart by race
EDL	00:10:02,623	00:10:04,927	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Seemed so wrong to me
EDL	00:10:05,439	00:10:09,023	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	In his mind this law was actually
EDL	00:10:09,023	00:10:14,911	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Not limiting discrimination but actually perpetuating
EDL	00:10:14,911	00:10:16,959	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I don't know what a
EDL	00:10:16,959	00:10:19,775	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The average person upon realizing this would have done
EDL	00:10:20,287	00:10:21,567	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I decided
EDL	00:10:21,567	00:10:22,335	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	To file a lawsuit
EDL	00:10:24,383	00:10:30,783	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Decided to sue the state of Texas called a few friends who lived in the 18th District
EDL	00:10:30,783	00:10:37,183	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Racially diverse group of people African-American Hispanic
EDL	00:10:37,183	00:10:43,583	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	No I found a lawyer that I can afford $7,000 a month we filed a lawsuit challenging the con
EDL	00:10:43,583	00:10:49,983	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Constitutionality Texas's redistricting plan
EDL	00:10:49,983	00:10:55,103	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	But now it was being used as an excuse to segregate people into racially polarized District
EDL	00:10:56,127	00:10:59,455	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	It worked its way through the lower courts and
EDL	00:10:59,455	00:11:00,479	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Tonight
EDL	00:11:00,479	00:11:02,527	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Shocked and surprised
EDL	00:11:03,039	00:11:04,831	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	In 1995
EDL	00:11:05,343	00:11:11,743	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Number 94805 George W bush vs Alvera of the Supreme Court
EDL	00:11:11,743	00:11:17,887	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Look it up
EDL	00:11:18,911	00:11:19,679	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	AR
EDL	00:11:19,679	00:11:23,519	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Components step to the lectern and
EDL	00:11:23,519	00:11:29,919	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Is the constitutionality of three congressional districts they make their arguments
EDL	00:11:29,919	00:11:36,319	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Texas basically said all we have to put people together by race
EDL	00:11:36,319	00:11:38,111	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Legislature has the obligation
EDL	00:11:38,879	00:11:43,231	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	To satisfy Federal requirements requirements
EDL	00:11:43,231	00:11:47,839	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Like remember the Voting Rights Act we're trying to make sure that there are enough minorities in this District
EDL	00:11:47,839	00:11:52,959	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	So that they have a chance to elect a representative or advocate
EDL	00:11:52,959	00:11:59,103	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	May I please the court his arguments
EDL	00:11:59,103	00:12:00,383	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	But look at the map
EDL	00:12:00,383	00:12:01,407	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The map is
EDL	00:12:01,919	00:12:02,943	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Bizarre
EDL	00:12:02,943	00:12:04,991	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And the only reason
EDL	00:12:04,991	00:12:06,527	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	It could have gotten this way as
EDL	00:12:06,527	00:12:07,807	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Because you're only thinking about race
EDL	00:12:08,319	00:12:09,087	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Only race
EDL	00:12:09,599	00:12:14,207	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Think about it that seems messed up isn't that messed up it doesn't matter what your ultimate goal is
EDL	00:12:14,207	00:12:15,487	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You cannot use
EDL	00:12:15,487	00:12:21,887	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Forbidden tools rate is forbidden by the 14th Amendment to be used as a tool
EDL	00:12:21,887	00:12:28,031	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	A very tense situation
EDL	00:12:47,487	00:12:49,023	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	So in the end
EDL	00:12:49,023	00:12:53,887	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Supreme Court
EDL	00:12:53,887	00:12:56,447	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Hair-splitting decision
EDL	00:12:56,447	00:12:59,775	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	But I think it's at this deeper question that
EDL	00:12:59,775	00:13:01,823	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	In our society
EDL	00:13:01,823	00:13:05,151	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Discourse we just haven't figured out how to talk about in a way
EDL	00:13:05,151	00:13:10,783	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You don't look if you're defining race just as the color of someone's skin
EDL	00:13:10,783	00:13:17,183	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The government cannot use that in any way that's against the constitution on the other hand if you take the
EDL	00:13:17,183	00:13:23,583	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	This wider View and you look at race in the context of History social context then
EDL	00:13:23,583	00:13:28,191	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	How can the government address discrimination without taking race into account that they have to
EDL	00:13:28,191	00:13:30,239	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	So it's difficult balance
EDL	00:13:30,239	00:13:31,519	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You can't look at race
EDL	00:13:31,519	00:13:32,031	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	But you have to
EDL	00:13:33,567	00:13:34,335	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And
EDL	00:13:34,335	00:13:36,895	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The Supreme Court says to Texas look
EDL	00:13:36,895	00:13:40,223	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	All you're doing in this case is sorting People based on how they're labeled on us
EDL	00:13:40,991	00:13:45,599	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You're not looking at that wider context you're not looking at if he's communities with next to each other
EDL	00:13:45,599	00:13:46,879	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Common interest
EDL	00:13:46,879	00:13:48,927	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You're just sorting them based on
EDL	00:13:48,927	00:13:50,719	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Race alone and that's not good enough
EDL	00:13:51,231	00:13:52,767	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You can't do that when the
EDL	00:13:52,767	00:13:54,303	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Pinyin came down
EDL	00:13:54,815	00:13:57,631	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The Supreme Court ruled in our favor 5 to 4
EDL	00:13:58,143	00:13:59,935	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	That was quite
EDL	00:14:00,703	00:14:01,471	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	A day
EDL	00:14:02,239	00:14:04,287	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The day that we won that lawsuit
EDL	00:14:04,287	00:14:09,919	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I was going to stream

EDL	00:17:00,927	00:17:01,695	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Is it
EDL	00:17:01,695	00:17:02,975	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You look at the Civil Rights
EDL	00:17:02,975	00:17:03,999	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Videos you see tens

EDL	00:18:10,815	00:18:12,095	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	In terms of

EDL	00:18:14,655	00:18:15,935	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	We have

EDL	00:18:16,959	00:18:19,263	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	180 degrees
EDL	00:18:19,263	00:18:19,775	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	From
EDL	00:18:20,287	00:18:26,687	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	1960s degrees because of the law which you helped overturn an indent and we don't know
EDL	00:18:26,687	00:18:30,527	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	To what degree that is the psychology of America changing or the fact that we had a lot

EDL	00:18:32,575	00:18:38,975	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And now that love has gone and now we see voter ID laws coming back into play which I think any like saying purse
EDL	00:18:38,975	00:18:42,047	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Admit is it is it is it is an attempt a blatant attempt
EDL	00:18:42,047	00:18:42,815	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Disenfranchised
EDL	00:18:42,815	00:18:47,423	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	People do it feels a little bit strange that two I mean I completely agree with your things have gotten better
EDL	00:18:47,423	00:18:48,191	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Same time I think
EDL	00:18:48,959	00:18:51,263	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Well that was because of the wall That's now gone
EDL	00:18:51,775	00:18:55,359	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Look laws change laws
EDL	00:18:55,359	00:18:56,383	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Evolve
EDL	00:18:56,383	00:18:58,431	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	+ and at some point
EDL	00:18:59,199	00:19:00,991	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	They need to come to an end
EDL	00:19:07,391	00:19:09,951	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	So after winning the Shelby County case
EDL	00:19:11,231	00:19:13,279	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Ed Blum turned his attention to
EDL	00:19:14,559	00:19:16,863	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Affirmative action good universities be able to
EDL	00:19:16,863	00:19:23,263	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Racial preferences in college admissions you found a young white woman named Abigail Fisher
EDL	00:19:23,263	00:19:26,335	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Race may have hurt her chances to attend the University of Texas
EDL	00:19:26,335	00:19:32,735	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	There were people in my class with lower grades to Warren and all the activities I was in who were being accepted into UT and
EDL	00:19:32,735	00:19:35,295	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The only other difference between us what color are skin
EDL	00:19:35,807	00:19:37,087	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Case goes to the Supreme Court
EDL	00:19:37,599	00:19:38,623	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And in that case
EDL	00:19:39,135	00:19:45,535	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The Supreme Court has upheld the affirmative action program at the University of Texas
EDL	00:19:45,535	00:19:46,815	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Who is constitutional
EDL	00:19:47,327	00:19:48,095	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Ed Bloom law
EDL	00:19:49,119	00:19:49,631	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	But
EDL	00:19:50,399	00:19:55,007	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	At the end of that original piece he made it clear to us he wasn't giving up I'm a long distance Runner
EDL	00:19:55,775	00:19:59,871	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	If there's something just emblematic about my personality
EDL	00:19:59,871	00:20:01,151	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Run
EDL	00:20:01,151	00:20:02,175	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Long distance
EDL	00:20:02,687	00:20:06,271	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And even as the court was coming down with his decision against him
EDL	00:20:07,039	00:20:08,319	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	He was planning his next move
EDL	00:20:09,855	00:20:10,623	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	That's coming up next
EDL	00:20:15,743	00:20:19,583	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	This is my perfect MCAT I will bring the action up to the present
EDL	00:20:19,583	00:20:23,935	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	After Ed Bloom lost that Supreme Court case against University of Texas last year
EDL	00:20:24,703	00:20:26,239	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	He kept the case going on the state level
EDL	00:20:27,007	00:20:29,311	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And he took aim at two more schools
EDL	00:20:29,311	00:20:30,335	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I have
EDL	00:20:30,335	00:20:32,639	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Retain counsel to litigate
EDL	00:20:32,639	00:20:34,687	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Harvard's admission policies in
EDL	00:20:34,687	00:20:36,479	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	University of North Carolina admissions
EDL	00:20:37,247	00:20:41,599	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	He formed an organization called students for fair Admissions and this time
EDL	00:20:42,111	00:20:45,183	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The target was perceived discrimination against
EDL	00:20:45,183	00:20:46,207	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Asian-American
EDL	00:20:47,231	00:20:50,815	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Case against Harvard is in the early stages but I recently called them up
EDL	00:20:51,583	00:20:53,119	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You just kind of get an update
EDL	00:20:53,119	00:20:53,631	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	On this
EDL	00:20:54,143	00:20:54,911	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Crusade
EDL	00:20:54,911	00:20:58,751	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The ultimate goal is to have the Supreme Court revisit it
EDL	00:21:00,031	00:21:02,335	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	We can come fortunate opinion in Fisher
EDL	00:21:02,335	00:21:04,127	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And in the use of race and ethnic
EDL	00:21:04,895	00:21:05,919	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Once and for all
EDL	00:21:05,919	00:21:08,223	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	That's the goal of this organization in this organization
EDL	00:21:08,735	00:21:09,503	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Mistake
EDL	00:21:09,503	00:21:10,527	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Active until that
EDL	00:21:11,295	00:21:13,855	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Is this a situation where lie quiz
EDL	00:21:13,855	00:21:16,159	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Utu

EDL	00:21:25,376	00:21:26,656	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I did with

EDL	00:21:28,448	00:21:29,984	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And that is

EDL	00:23:28,768	00:23:29,280	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Well
EDL	00:23:29,792	00:23:33,376	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	We remember what happened with the
EDL	00:23:33,888	00:23:35,424	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The harassment
EDL	00:23:36,192	00:23:38,752	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Of Abigail Fisher

EDL	00:23:56,672	00:23:59,232	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	We learned an important lesson
EDL	00:23:59,744	00:24:00,256	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And that is
EDL	00:24:01,024	00:24:03,072	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Although there may be students
EDL	00:24:03,584	00:24:04,352	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Who are
EDL	00:24:05,376	00:24:07,936	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Brave enough to put their name on a lawsuit
EDL	00:24:07,936	00:24:08,960	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The consequences
EDL	00:24:09,472	00:24:09,984	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Canby

EDL	00:24:11,776	00:24:12,544	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And frightening
EDL	00:24:13,312	00:24:16,128	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	So all of the students involved in those
EDL	00:24:16,128	00:24:16,896	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Three cases
EDL	00:24:17,408	00:24:18,176	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Harvard

EDL	00:24:19,456	00:24:20,480	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And the University of Texas
EDL	00:24:21,248	00:24:21,760	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Have
EDL	00:24:22,272	00:24:22,784	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Standing
EDL	00:24:23,296	00:24:25,856	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	As members of the organization
EDL	00:24:26,368	00:24:27,392	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And their names

EDL	00:24:29,440	00:24:32,000	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Their email will never be made to the public
EDL	00:24:32,512	00:24:34,304	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	It's a funny thing though because
EDL	00:24:35,328	00:24:36,608	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I mean the idea of a
EDL	00:24:36,608	00:24:37,120	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Plaintiff
EDL	00:24:37,632	00:24:38,400	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Even if it is
EDL	00:24:39,168	00:24:40,192	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Often
EDL	00:24:42,496	00:24:43,008	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Pecan extract
EDL	00:24:45,312	00:24:49,408	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Strange to have plaintiff's that you can't examine and that you can't say OK Google who are they
EDL	00:24:49,920	00:24:50,688	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Exactly what others
EDL	00:24:51,968	00:24:54,016	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And you're right Abigail Fisher
EDL	00:24:54,016	00:24:55,040	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I think was
EDL	00:24:55,040	00:24:56,064	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Is the subject of some very high
EDL	00:24:56,832	00:24:57,344	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Kind of harass
EDL	00:24:58,368	00:25:01,696	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The same time who she was was a helpful starting point for
EDL	00:25:01,696	00:25:03,488	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	For the conversation about whether this should
EDL	00:25:03,488	00:25:04,000	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Exist
EDL	00:25:04,512	00:25:08,864	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Informative action or whatever you would call this doesn't happen in the corded happens in the world that have
EDL	00:25:09,376	00:25:10,656	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Society in this is something that is
EDL	00:25:10,656	00:25:11,424	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Affects all of us
EDL	00:25:11,424	00:25:13,472	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Well this is
EDL	00:25:13,472	00:25:14,496	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Very common
EDL	00:25:14,496	00:25:15,264	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And Federal
EDL	00:25:16,032	00:25:17,056	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The ACLU
EDL	00:25:17,056	00:25:17,568	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Which is a membership

EDL	00:25:20,384	00:25:22,176	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	In the name of the organization
EDL	00:25:23,200	00:25:25,504	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Disclosing only to the courts

EDL	00:25:27,040	00:25:27,808	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Actually harmed by the
EDL	00:25:27,808	00:25:30,112	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	So what we're doing is Not Unusual
EDL	00:25:30,880	00:25:31,648	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Yatchan
EDL	00:25:31,648	00:25:33,952	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Okay so you said in interviews
EDL	00:25:33,952	00:25:34,976	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	On this lawsuit.
EDL	00:25:35,488	00:25:37,792	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Asian American students are being penalized for being a
EDL	00:25:37,792	00:25:38,560	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	High-achieving minor
EDL	00:25:39,328	00:25:40,352	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	How do you argue
EDL	00:25:40,352	00:25:40,864	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	That they're being Penal
EDL	00:25:41,376	00:25:42,912	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Well in litigation like this
EDL	00:25:43,424	00:25:44,960	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	We know that the court
EDL	00:25:44,960	00:25:47,776	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Allows the use of race and ethnicity in admissions
EDL	00:25:48,288	00:25:49,568	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	What we also know
EDL	00:25:49,568	00:25:50,336	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Is that
EDL	00:25:50,336	00:25:51,360	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You cannot
EDL	00:25:51,360	00:25:52,384	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	As a university
EDL	00:25:52,896	00:25:53,664	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Have
EDL	00:25:53,664	00:25:54,432	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	2
EDL	00:25:54,432	00:25:55,712	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Heavy of a hand
EDL	00:25:56,224	00:25:57,504	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Using race and ethnicity
EDL	00:25:58,016	00:25:58,528	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And
EDL	00:25:59,296	00:25:59,808	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Furthermore
EDL	00:26:00,576	00:26:01,600	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Numerica
EDL	00:26:01,600	00:26:02,112	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Quotas
EDL	00:26:02,624	00:26:04,416	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Are completely forbidden
EDL	00:26:05,184	00:26:07,744	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And how we show that Asians are being
EDL	00:26:07,744	00:26:08,768	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Target in the harbor
EDL	00:26:09,792	00:26:11,584	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Is to look at the number of Asians
EDL	00:26:12,096	00:26:13,376	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Applied to Harvard
EDL	00:26:13,888	00:26:15,424	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	What percentage
EDL	00:26:15,424	00:26:17,728	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Year after year after year
EDL	00:26:18,240	00:26:19,520	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Has Harvard admitted
EDL	00:26:20,032	00:26:23,872	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And what we have found is it from 1992
EDL	00:26:24,384	00:26:25,664	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	True 2013
EDL	00:26:27,200	00:26:27,968	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The
EDL	00:26:28,480	00:26:31,040	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Percentage of Asians at Harvard admit
EDL	00:26:31,552	00:26:33,600	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Has been remarkably
EDL	00:26:34,368	00:26:34,880	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Flat
EDL	00:26:35,392	00:26:38,976	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	In fact in 1990 to 19%
EDL	00:26:40,512	00:26:42,304	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Harvard's freshman class
EDL	00:26:42,816	00:26:43,840	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Was Asian
EDL	00:26:44,352	00:26:47,424	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Wow in 2013
EDL	00:26:47,936	00:26:48,960	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	18%
EDL	00:26:49,728	00:26:50,240	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Oration
EDL	00:26:50,752	00:26:52,544	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Now that doesn't mean much
EDL	00:26:52,544	00:26:53,568	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Until you realize
EDL	00:26:54,080	00:26:56,384	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	That the number of Asians
EDL	00:26:56,384	00:26:57,408	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Applying to Harvard
EDL	00:26:58,432	00:26:59,968	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	During this period of time
EDL	00:26:59,968	00:27:01,504	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Better than doubled
EDL	00:27:01,504	00:27:06,624	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Just a quick note here Harvard hasn't actually released data on ethnicity and admissions for
EDL	00:27:06,624	00:27:08,928	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The years he was talking about so we can't confirm the numbers
EDL	00:27:09,440	00:27:10,464	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Fuse we know that
EDL	00:27:10,976	00:27:11,744	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Ed Loomis
EDL	00:27:11,744	00:27:12,512	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Drawing

EDL	00:27:18,144	00:27:21,216	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And by the way when he says 19% of the Freshman Class
EDL	00:27:21,728	00:27:23,008	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Turns out the number
EDL	00:27:23,520	00:27:24,288	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Using reverse
EDL	00:27:24,288	00:27:25,056	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	2 more than just for
EDL	00:27:26,336	00:27:28,640	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	If those kinds of data point
EDL	00:27:29,408	00:27:31,200	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	We're presented in court

EDL	00:27:59,104	00:27:59,872	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	If you take away race
EDL	00:28:00,640	00:28:03,968	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Filtering in admissions that what we would have is a more meritocratic
EDL	00:28:04,992	00:28:05,760	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Australian grades
EDL	00:28:07,296	00:28:08,064	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	But I mean
EDL	00:28:08,576	00:28:10,112	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Hasn't the meritocracy
EDL	00:28:10,624	00:28:11,392	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Isn't that true
EDL	00:28:11,392	00:28:13,440	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Just a myth I mean especially in a place like
EDL	00:28:13,440	00:28:16,000	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Like Harvard I mean if you look at the data at Harvard you see that
EDL	00:28:16,512	00:28:19,072	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	People whose parents went to Harvard we have family members who went to Harvard
EDL	00:28:19,840	00:28:20,864	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	They get preference
EDL	00:28:20,864	00:28:22,656	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Treatment in the admissions process
EDL	00:28:22,656	00:28:23,936	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	If you take that out just
EDL	00:28:23,936	00:28:25,728	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	It's a few wrongs okay people who have
EDL	00:28:26,240	00:28:27,008	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Families
EDL	00:28:27,008	00:28:29,568	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	It can afford to send them to Kaplan prep courses
EDL	00:28:29,568	00:28:30,848	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Is for the standardized test
EDL	00:28:31,616	00:28:37,248	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	They get a better like up and isn't that just kind of affirmative action for white people so that there's two ways I want to answer
EDL	00:28:38,016	00:28:39,296	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The first is that
EDL	00:28:39,808	00:28:40,320	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	It is
EDL	00:28:40,832	00:28:42,368	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Not up to me
EDL	00:28:42,368	00:28:43,904	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	It is not up to this organization
EDL	00:28:45,440	00:28:48,000	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	To dictate how Harvard or
EDL	00:28:48,000	00:28:49,280	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Texas or
EDL	00:28:49,792	00:28:53,632	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	University of North Carolina fashion their admissions policy
EDL	00:28:54,400	00:28:56,192	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The only thing legally
EDL	00:28:56,704	00:28:58,496	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	That we are advocating for
EDL	00:28:58,496	00:28:59,264	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Is
EDL	00:28:59,264	00:29:02,848	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The end of racial distinctions in the admissions
EDL	00:29:02,848	00:29:03,360	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Process
EDL	00:29:04,640	00:29:05,408	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Number two
EDL	00:29:05,920	00:29:06,944	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I agree
EDL	00:29:07,456	00:29:08,224	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Glad
EDL	00:29:08,224	00:29:09,504	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Colleges and universities
EDL	00:29:10,272	00:29:11,040	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Cannot
EDL	00:29:11,040	00:29:12,064	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Use just
EDL	00:29:12,064	00:29:13,088	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Strictly
EDL	00:29:13,088	00:29:14,880	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Grades and SAT scores
EDL	00:29:15,392	00:29:16,416	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	As an admissions correct
EDL	00:29:17,184	00:29:19,232	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I believe of Legacy preferences
EDL	00:29:19,744	00:29:21,536	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Should have been ended at Harvard
EDL	00:29:21,536	00:29:23,072	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And throughout the country
EDL	00:29:23,584	00:29:24,352	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Decades
EDL	00:29:24,352	00:29:24,864	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Citgo
EDL	00:29:25,376	00:29:27,680	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I think people who write big checks
EDL	00:29:27,680	00:29:28,960	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Do universities
EDL	00:29:28,960	00:29:32,288	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Whose children then get a leg up in the admissions process
EDL	00:29:32,288	00:29:33,312	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I think that audit
EDL	00:29:34,080	00:29:36,384	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	I think the colleges and universities
EDL	00:29:36,384	00:29:37,664	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Have an obligation
EDL	00:29:38,176	00:29:39,456	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Reach Out
EDL	00:29:39,456	00:29:41,504	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Kids from disadvantaged background
EDL	00:29:42,528	00:29:43,296	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Kids whose
EDL	00:29:43,808	00:29:46,880	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Family income is too small and blowout
EDL	00:29:47,648	00:29:49,184	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Whose parents didn't go to college
EDL	00:29:49,696	00:29:53,024	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Who maybe grew up in a tough neighborhood
EDL	00:29:53,792	00:29:56,352	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Colleges should use that
EDL	00:29:56,352	00:29:57,376	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And not race
EDL	00:29:57,888	00:29:59,424	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	If they're going to give
EDL	00:29:59,424	00:30:00,448	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	A leg up
EDL	00:30:00,448	00:30:01,216	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Yan
EDL	00:30:01,216	00:30:02,752	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Helping kids from
EDL	00:30:02,752	00:30:04,288	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	These disadvantaged background
EDL	00:30:04,288	00:30:05,568	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	That means
EDL	00:30:05,568	00:30:09,152	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	That there will be lots of African-American kids lots of Hispanics
EDL	00:30:09,152	00:30:11,456	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Lots of Asians
EDL	00:30:11,456	00:30:12,736	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And lots of white kids
EDL	00:30:14,016	00:30:17,344	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	You know a helping hand from Harvard and Princeton and Yale and stand
EDL	00:30:18,112	00:30:22,464	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	There is no reason why an Asian applicants to Harvard
EDL	00:30:22,976	00:30:23,488	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Who's
EDL	00:30:24,000	00:30:25,792	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Parents are laborers
EDL	00:30:26,560	00:30:30,400	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Mom works as a maid at a hotel in New York
EDL	00:30:30,400	00:30:31,936	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And dad works
EDL	00:30:31,936	00:30:34,240	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	As I'm kitchen worker at a Chinese restaurant
EDL	00:30:35,008	00:30:38,080	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	There is no reason why that kid should be penalized
EDL	00:30:39,104	00:30:40,640	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And white kids
EDL	00:30:40,640	00:30:44,736	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	African American kids and Hispanic kids who come from professional backgrounds
EDL	00:30:44,736	00:30:45,248	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	To be elevate
EDL	00:30:45,760	00:30:49,088	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Ending racial classifications and preferences
EDL	00:30:49,088	00:30:51,136	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And instead substituting
EDL	00:30:51,136	00:30:53,184	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Socio-economic preferences
EDL	00:30:53,184	00:30:55,232	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Is something that both the left
EDL	00:30:55,232	00:30:56,256	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And the right can agree
EDL	00:30:56,768	00:31:00,864	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	But it's interesting to think about what might happen in the transitional
EDL	00:31:00,864	00:31:01,376	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Space
EDL	00:31:01,888	00:31:04,448	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Between say and Ed Bloom victory
EDL	00:31:04,960	00:31:07,264	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And that remedied
EDL	00:31:07,264	00:31:08,032	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Ignition switch
EDL	00:31:08,032	00:31:10,080	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Cuz I was just thinking I might okay so take
EDL	00:31:10,080	00:31:10,592	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Sexy men like
EDL	00:31:11,360	00:31:12,896	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Abigail Fisher in with holder in the rights
EDL	00:31:13,664	00:31:14,688	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Left side remind
EDL	00:31:14,688	00:31:16,480	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Let's say you get
EDL	00:31:16,480	00:31:17,760	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The harbor case to scotus
EDL	00:31:18,528	00:31:19,296	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And you win
EDL	00:31:19,296	00:31:19,808	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And
EDL	00:31:20,576	00:31:23,136	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The court agrees that there is some kind of quota and place
EDL	00:31:23,136	00:31:24,672	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Any longer support that
EDL	00:31:25,184	00:31:30,816	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	There should not be any kind of limit on high how many high-achieving Asian-American students get into Harvard
EDL	00:31:30,816	00:31:31,584	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Or any University
EDL	00:31:32,608	00:31:36,192	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	It's interesting to think of the effect that might have on white applicants
EDL	00:31:36,704	00:31:37,472	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Like
EDL	00:31:37,472	00:31:40,032	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Abigail Fisher we make this
EDL	00:31:40,032	00:31:40,800	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Argument
EDL	00:31:40,800	00:31:41,568	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	In our lawsuit
EDL	00:31:42,336	00:31:44,128	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The argument is that
EDL	00:31:44,128	00:31:45,152	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	African Americans
EDL	00:31:45,920	00:31:46,432	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Hispanic
EDL	00:31:47,200	00:31:48,224	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And white
EDL	00:31:48,992	00:31:50,272	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Are getting a preference
EDL	00:31:51,040	00:31:51,808	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Over
EDL	00:31:51,808	00:31:52,832	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Better qualified
EDL	00:31:53,344	00:31:53,856	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Asian app
EDL	00:31:54,368	00:31:56,416	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	So it is very likely
EDL	00:31:56,416	00:31:56,928	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And white
EDL	00:31:58,976	00:32:02,048	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Seaweed you asserted that in our lawsuit
EDL	00:32:02,560	00:32:04,864	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	This is not an attempt
EDL	00:32:05,632	00:32:06,144	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	2
EDL	00:32:06,656	00:32:08,192	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Reinvigorate
EDL	00:32:08,704	00:32:10,240	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	White applicants
EDL	00:32:11,008	00:32:12,288	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	All of the ivy league
EDL	00:32:12,288	00:32:14,080	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Schools like Duke
EDL	00:32:14,080	00:32:14,592	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Stanford
EDL	00:32:16,128	00:32:18,688	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The number of whites as likely to go down
EDL	00:32:18,688	00:32:19,968	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	The number of Agents
EDL	00:32:19,968	00:32:20,736	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Likely to go up
EDL	00:32:22,016	00:32:22,784	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	ATS
EDL	00:32:22,784	00:32:26,880	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	That's why we don't have any whites as plaintiff's in our Harvard lawsuit
EDL	00:32:27,392	00:32:29,184	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	That's why none of the kids
EDL	00:32:29,696	00:32:31,488	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Join students for fair admissions
EDL	00:32:32,000	00:32:33,024	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	How to challenge Harbor
EDL	00:32:33,024	00:32:34,816	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	We're white is because
EDL	00:32:34,816	00:32:36,096	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	They're benefiting
EDL	00:32:36,864	00:32:39,680	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	From the Discrimination that Asians are suffering there
EDL	00:32:43,776	00:32:47,360	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Best ever bloom
EDL	00:32:48,384	00:32:54,784	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Harvard sent us a statement which didn't directly respond to Ed Blum specific allegations but they did
EDL	00:32:54,784	00:32:55,808	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Save the date
EDL	00:32:55,808	00:32:58,880	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Do make an effort to create diversity in the student body
EDL	00:32:59,392	00:33:05,280	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	Because when a student encounters different types of people with the experiences that student grows
EDL	00:33:06,304	00:33:08,608	| moreperfect120617_thearchitect |	And you can read their full statement on our website
