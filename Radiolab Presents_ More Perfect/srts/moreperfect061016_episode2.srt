1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Listener-supported WNYC

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,168
Be Studios

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,800
But I think we should start the story on June 25th 1969

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,104
But first you should say Who You Are

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,872
I'm jazz

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,432
Ride this is more perfect okay so why

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,968
Why 220 when was it

8
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,248
June 25th nineteen

9
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,040
69

10
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,624
Supreme Court chief justice Earl Warren is retiring or a Warren of

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648
The Warren Court

12
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,184
Isn't that a big word

13
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:34,560
Yeah that's what I think of you think of legendary

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,376
Supreme Court Justices he's probably in

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,704
He was one of the mount Olympians he's a big deal

16
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:45,568
Rights that he's retiring he's been on the court for 16 years

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,872
And he's in an interview and he's asked

18
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:54,272
How would you list Mister Chief Justice of the Supreme Court's most important decision you're 16 years here

19
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:01,440
He's kind of astounding

20
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,976
Before you hear the answer

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
Think that you need to know that he could have said all kinds of cases

22
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
Is he was the chief justice

23
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,912
During

24
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:17,312
Miranda

25
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:21,408
Earl Gideon petitioner Gideon versus Wainwright

26
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
Duty

27
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,344
Athens Big Bore

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,648
Brown versus Board of Education okay

29
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,512
Sad when I know that one

30
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,792
He doesn't say any of those

31
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,096
Was he say

32
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,656
He says this little case called

33
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,704
The Baker vs. Carr case

34
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,752
Baker vs. Carr

35
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
The back case

36
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:53,408
Is perhaps the most important case that believe that

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Since I've been on the court

38
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,064
He thought that case whatever it is is more important than the case that desegregated schools

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
You did

40
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
So what the hell is it

41
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
Exactly

42
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
No really what is it

43
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,512
It's this case that was so dramatic and

44
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,536
So traumatic

45
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,352
It apparently broke to Justice

46
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
There was an instance

47
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
In which my

48
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,752
Brother found my father going upstairs

49
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
To get a shot

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,736
Supreme Court of the United States

51
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,560
United States

52
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:47,168
United States and this honorable Court

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
Is this more perfect miniseries about the Supreme Court just a frame the story we're about to hear for

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Second

55
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,280
As we were putting the show together

56
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
We hosted a panel discussion

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,424
Best one stage and a woman in the audience asked the following question

58
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
Yes could you

59
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,776
Address what I see is the

60
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,336
Increasing politicization

61
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,152
Of the Court the apotheosis of which I guess was

62
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,968
You know voting

63
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,296
Electing Bush to be a hour

64
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
President

65
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
Difficult always been this way is this just my perception that it's becoming more popular size

66
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,792
See this turns out to be really interesting question turns out

67
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:50,144
I didn't know this until City started looking into it that there was a moment

68
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
When the Pandora's Box

69
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,728
Just got ripped open

70
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,592
So I think they understand that moment and this story you have to get to know 3 characters

71
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:04,992
These aren't necessarily the three most important justices of all time because at that time you had chief justice Earl

72
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:09,088
Warren and William Brennan on the court and he's our kind of giants

73
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,904
But for this story

74
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
These three guys are

75
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
One of them is on the right one of them is on the left

76
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
And one of them is

77
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Stuck right in the middle

78
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
Tragically in the middle

79
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
Air on the conservative side

80
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,215
What difference does it make when it's in the Constitution

81
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,287
Any other expression or action by the state

82
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,335
You had a guy named Felix Frankfurter

83
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
Did Justice Frankfurter was one of the most

84
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,687
Latest really it name is really Frankfurter

85
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
One of the most

86
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,247
Influential Justice

87
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:42,111
Of all time I bet taragrove she teaches constitutional law at William and Mary Law School

88
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
I'm here

89
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,463
A very influential scholar at Harvard Law School before

90
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
He became address

91
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:51,839
With a close adviser to Franklin Delano Roosevelt he was extremely smart

92
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
Towering figure

93
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,655
But as a person

94
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Justice

95
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
Justice Frankfurter

96
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
He wasn't necessarily

97
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
The nicest person

98
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,615
I heard that from everyone

99
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
I always call him a Bantam rooster

100
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,503
He was a difficult Krusty figure who is short

101
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,295
A little bit of a pouch

102
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,623
Was one of the most

103
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
What Justice is

104
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,999
He was a tough customer when a clerk would come to the US

105
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,839
Supreme Court Chambers to deliver a message in the person of the door

106
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,655
Tried to hand Justice Frankfurter the paper

107
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,727
Frankfurter would inevitably Let It Drop to the ground

108
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
So the person had to bend down and pick it up

109
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Two handed to him again

110
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Dude that's a

111
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,831
And by the way the voices you heard besides Tara Grover professors Mike seidman Georgetown University

112
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:50,975
Microphone won't School Craig Smith California University of Pennsylvania Supreme Court Clerk

113
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,279
Alan Cohen Long John

114
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,679
Okay so Frankfurter is on one side of the aisle and his Nemesis is a gentleman on the other side of the aisle

115
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:06,079
Illiberal named William O Douglas

116
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,479
He was Justice Douglas now in the Supreme Court Chambers recording from the 1950s

117
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,015
7 interview with Justice Douglas

118
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
Looks very well as faces 10 rugged his eyes sparkle

119
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
Mountain climbing environmentalist

120
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:28,095
Big on civil liberties

121
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:31,679
Music by generation was like Justice Frankfurter

122
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,495
Douglas was a prick

123
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,055
But everybody around him everybody hated him

124
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,663
All those same adjective

125
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Applied

126
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,967
Here's how the New York Times

127
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,367
Scriptum Douglas was married four times

128
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,119
This is footage from his last marriage to his wife Kathleen

129
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
He was 67

130
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935
She was 23

131
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
So

132
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,567
Yes yes that it that is William Douglas

133
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,639
They have these two guys Frankfurter the Bantam rooster Douglas

134
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,199
The prick and as you can imagine big hater

135
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:15,967
Charter

136
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Despise

137
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:25,951
So Frankfurter had this habit of monologuing and while he would go on and on Douglas with just pull out a book right in front of them

138
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
Start reading you know he was just opening his the same for Frankfurter I actually found a series of interviews that word

139
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,935
Donald Douglas in the early sixties where he basically calls Frankfurter names

140
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Wow

141
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
Why they hate each other so much

142
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,695
According to Mike seidman some of that comes from

143
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Maybe there

144
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,255
Difference in background

145
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
Frankfurter was

146
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
A Jewish

147
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
Immigrant from Austria

148
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
A Douglas was a Westerner

149
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
But according to him

150
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,751
Or of their hatred

151
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
Actually was ideological reflected

152
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,127
I really important split

153
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,455
Over how powerful the court should be

154
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
Doctor Frankfurter

155
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:27,647
Quartz just want not to intervene and he believed that many matter should be left up to the political process

156
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
And the court should stay out of those issues

157
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:40,447
Court want to intervene to protect for example of minority groups Free Speech rights things of that sort

158
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,775
Do you have this personal Feud going you had this

159
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
Ideological war that was brewing in the court

160
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,615
And into the middle of all of this

161
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
Walks Charles Whitaker

162
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
You might call him the Swing Vote

163
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,743
Okay this is Alan Cohen Supreme Court Clerk

164
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
Or Justice Whitaker

165
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,327
From 19

166
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,863
57

167
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
21958

168
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,727
Whitaker grew up in a small town in Kansas called Troy

169
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,543
Antithesis of flashy this is his granddaughter

170
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,663
It's kind of a one-room schoolhouse overview Little Red Schoolhouse work on the farm

171
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
But he

172
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,039
He he determined that was not the life for him

173
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:33,951
Kate says when he was around sixteen he became obsessed with the idea of becoming a lawyer and she says he would actually practice law

174
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
To the animals

175
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
Can you imagine you know pushing

176
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
The plow along in the fields and them lecturing and arguing cases to the cows or to the horses or whatever

177
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
Earlier that he was lecturing to yes

178
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:53,407
Oh and on the side he was he would hunt he would hunt the squirrels opossum raccoon

179
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,455
I need sell the pelts for a few dollars

180
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,807
Any amassed I think $700 would that money put himself through Law School

181
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:04,415
My understanding is that he simultaneously went to law school and high school

182
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:10,559
What which is just mind-boggling but yeah apparently he went to the head of the law school in Kansas City and he's like

183
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
I don't know high school diploma but

184
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,119
You need to let me in

185
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,959
Vadim just saw how ambitious he was and he was impressed me is like Alright you're in

186
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,983
I love this guy

187
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
He's like Mr bootstrap

188
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
Totally any how to make a long story short the top lawyer and Alan Cohen says that's because he would

189
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,783
Do better than all of his opponents he would outwork them out prepare the great attention to detail

190
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Great

191
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,087
Presents before a jury

192
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:37,951
And then he becomes a judge for a federal district judge and then an appeals court judge

193
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,023
Then in February of 1957

194
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,047
He gets the call

195
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,631
As I recall it was in the evening and asked if he could be in Washington

196
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Nginx

197
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,703
Warning this is Kent Whitaker

198
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
Charles Whitaker

199
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:54,335
He should certainly but my best blue shoe deals at the cleaners tonight

200
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
What did he wear

201
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
As a matter of fact

202
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,247
My mother or someone else got the cleaners open up at night

203
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,879
In the first allegation

204
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:13,023
Tending to show that the corporation's right of exercise of free will happen

205
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,839
This is one of the first time that Whitaker spoke on the bench

206
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:21,215
Energex with a question for the attorney and he is Midwestern bullet

207
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,007
Minion Rush

208
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:28,127
But I have a question or two

209
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
The thing is crazy to me is it

210
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,759
He walked into the highest court in the land in

211
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,831
He didn't even go to college important

212
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,903
Understand that he had no formal education

213
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,719
Another word she never took history

214
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
Political science or social science

215
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,375
But do you love the law my father was not an idea log

216
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,423
He expected

217
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
The court to be

218
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:58,335
An arena in which there were Lively arguments on legal issues

219
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,359
That's what

220
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,895
He enjoyed

221
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,479
What are what's really good at what you love

222
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
Has Kent Whitaker puts it

223
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,087
His dad was kind of the walking embodiment of that thing that

224
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:15,487
Chief Justice John Roberts said back in 2005 during his confirmation hearings chairman. Come before the committee with no agenda

225
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
He was sort of a blank slate

226
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,839
My job to call balls and Strikes

227
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,119
And not the pitch

228
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Or bat

229
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,727
My father was not interested in advancing a

230
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
Pause or a

231
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,335
Siri but frankly that's adjusted

232
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:36,735
Should be that you are approaching it without a political agenda and you're deciding it I think

233
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,015
Exactly right

234
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
But

235
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
In practice

236
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
Show many of their cases

237
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
There is no law

238
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:48,767
To turn to to decide those cases

239
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,887
Ken says that his dad quickly discovered the law by the Supreme Court is never clean cut

240
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:58,751
Cases make it there precisely because the law isn't clear

241
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Without pressure

242
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
And it's in those cases

243
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,407
You have must have your ideology

244
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
As a

245
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
As a starting

246
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
And the fact that he didn't have an ideology

247
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,367
That was vulnerable he was definitely getting lobbied

248
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
From both sides

249
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
Sprinkler on one side

250
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,791
Douglas on the other the new kid on the Block and was being pulled by

251
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
Each one like

252
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,495
The way the judges bowling for votes within his first three months he found himself in the middle of a death penalty

253
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,031
Polycave she was found

254
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,103
Your bedroom by fireman taken outside

255
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
Turn that after 4 now

256
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:42,527
A guy I've been tried for arson and murder and Douglas and liberals wanted to intervene to help them

257
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,599
They feel like you've been treated unfairly by the lower courts

258
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,671
But Frankford when the conservatives thought that the Supreme Court should be

259
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Just a should honor Preston

260
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
According to Justice

261
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
Does Douglas

262
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
Justice Whittaker was undecided all the time

263
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
Douglas would tell him one thing

264
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
Writing and Justice Frankfurter would say something else

265
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
I think there was some thought that you

266
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,311
He might

267
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,335
Side with

268
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
The guy who talked with him laugh

269
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
You know

270
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:14,783
He ends up being so undecided on this death penalty case that he forces the court to delay the vote until the next

271
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,855
In the world series of cases like this

272
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:24,255
Read aloud be fuzzy ideologies would Harden and Whitaker he would be right in the middle

273
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
Physical

274
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,607
Depictions of him in that first year from people who saw him

275
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,679
Describe somebody who was

276
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
Restless

277
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
Terribly unhappy

278
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,055
I had lost a lot of weight nervous

279
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
Was agitated most of the

280
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
The time

281
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
It was a lot of stress

282
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
This was just for the normal course on the California procedures and butt over the next week

283
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:57,023
Bounces back you find his feet

284
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,071
His production increase

285
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Eventually

286
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,935
In his third year his fourth year and part of his V

287
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,055
He wrote as many opinions that is any other judge

288
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,127
He wrote as many dissenting opinions as any other

289
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,711
He was one of the nine it was fully employed

290
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,527
And he wrote some very important opinions

291
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
During that period of time

292
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
And Along came a bigger versus

293
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Does car

294
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
And it broken

295
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:50,527
Avis more perfect I'm Jenn I'm writing a story from Suzie lechtenberg

296
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
About the case that broke two justices

297
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Number

298
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
123 Charles W Baker at Alcatel appellant versus Josie car

299
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,375
Okay so it's April 19th 1961

300
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,263
The Supreme Court is hearing Baker vs. Carr

301
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,567
This is an individual

302
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,103
Voting rights

303
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,503
11 qualified voters in the state of Tennessee

304
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,903
Not on the surface Baker vs. Carr was about districts and how people are counted in this country and this is

305
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:34,303
Is one of the most basic ways that political power gets assigned in America

306
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,703
That growth should be reflected in the number of Congress people that are representing them but at that time

307
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,103
Tennessee Hennessy hadn't changed its legislative district

308
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:53,503
Since 1901 which was 60 years earlier will this create a big problem

309
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,903
Sims 4 urban areas like Memphis because in those 60 years people have moved to the cities in

310
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,719
Gross and rural areas were getting smaller

311
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:09,119
But the Tennessee State Legislature had refused to update account and it was still giving more representation to those real

312
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Rural areas

313
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,935
In Tennessee

314
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,727
The figure was

315
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
23 to 1

316
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:19,103
NYU Law Professor Sam is that girl that for people that don't understand how does it actually dilute

317
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Your vote

318
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,895
This is very

319
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
You have one District that has

320
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,783
One person in it and you have another District

321
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
It has 20

322
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
T3 people

323
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:31,391
The district that has one person gives all the

324
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
The power to that

325
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
The district

326
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,231
It has 23 people

327
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,047
Spread it out over Altamont

328
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
What I think of it this way

329
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,447
At that time a person in the city in Tennessee

330
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,591
Had one 23rd as much of a voice in the legislature as a person living in the countryside and

331
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,615
Cheers

332
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,663
Sword of the Insidious underbelly of that

333
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,991
It just so happened that the people living in the countryside

334
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:57,759
Are mostly White

335
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,087
And a large percentage of the people living in the city were black

336
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,927
Underline all of the reapportionment litigation leasing South was

337
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
White supremacy

338
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,071
That's Doug Smith historian and the author of on the market

339
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:16,959
Your doorstep this is deeply tied to white supremacy in the maintenance of Jim Crow was a method of making sure that rural

340
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,799
A white legislators continue to control the power structure

341
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,967
So you had the situation he says we're a small minority was choking the majority

342
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:34,367
Suburban areas from any sort of any sorts of funds cities couldn't get the money they needed for Rhodes education social services so

343
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,415
So the question at the Supreme Court was

344
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,719
And it actually tackle this in two separate things

345
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
What should I do about this

346
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
And here's where you get to the ideological Smackdown liberals on the court like Douglas basically agreed with the plaintiff when they are

347
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:11,999
Liberal

348
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,583
Yeah this is clearly an injustice people in the cities are getting screwed

349
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:22,239
Their voting rights have been diluted in the basement

350
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,263
Yes

351
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,823
People are getting hurt but we're not going to do any

352
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:32,479
We can't Frankfurter

353
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:38,879
Zipper sleeve said we cannot get involved that as bad as it says it was not an issue that the court should get involved in right now

354
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
Well

355
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:51,679
How to wear the salute during the fact that this is a unique situation

356
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:58,079
Tennessee situation if we end up doing this in Tennessee pretty soon we'll be intervening in California South Carolina

357
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:04,479
Jason will be rewriting the entire us legislative map

358
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
Tennessee

359
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,063
This is the United States not Tennessee

360
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,439
Yes so basically he felt like this would force the courts to get involved in politics

361
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:18,303
And he really believe that the court should never ever get involved in politics

362
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
This is a

363
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:23,679
This is an idea that goes way back to something called

364
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
Political question.

365
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
The political question Doctrine says

366
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:31,615
No federal court can decide this issue at all

367
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,175
E-courts simply had no business

368
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
Getting into it work

369
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:40,575
Consider to be fundamentally political questions and what could be more fun in my life political than the makeup of the legislature

370
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,975
It's a philosophy rooted in the notion that unelected lifetime judges should not

371
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,279
Happy substituting their will

372
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,607
For the will of the people's elected representatives

373
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:59,519
Frankfurter feel like even if you have a terrible political situation if the justices stepped in and overruled the legislature

374
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
That would be worse than doing nothing at all

375
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
Because it would be fundamentally undemocratic

376
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
I'm he viewed

377
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,199
Give you the political question Doctrine

378
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,783
Is a crucial limitation on the Federal Judicial power

379
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,391
And he wasn't alone the courts at follow this guideline for about a hundred and fifty years

380
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:20,000
And even with the current case in Tennessee federal court that first heard the case

381
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Recognized

382
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,936
The situation actually referred to it as in evil

383
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Play info

384
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,032
But this is that this is a political question

385
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Malapportionment

386
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:38,176
The political question and only the political branches can handle this

387
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
Protecting and enforcing

388
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
Voting rights

389
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,112
So

390
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,512
Ventana school when the lawyer for Tennessee got up there

391
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
Didn't try to defend her Tennessee was counting or not counting its people he basically said yeah what we're doing is bad

392
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,472
But it's nobody's job but hours to fix

393
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
Is it worth

394
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,080
The legislature of Tennessee

395
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
Not

396
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
Terraria potions

397
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
Warriors

398
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,760
Federal District

399
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Violate

400
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,344
Angel.

401
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
Separation

402
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:24,768
He basically said if you step in you're going to screw up the balance of power in America

403
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,816
Power America comes from We the People

404
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:33,216
Not the courts so this matter should be left up to the people of Tennessee and their elected representatives

405
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
If the whole problem is that you don't have a voice in the ledge

406
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Glacier then how can you suddenly

407
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,848
To have a voice

408
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
In legislature

409
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,992
I mean either way to change it would be SC legislature itself where to give up power and why would they do that

410
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
Can of course

411
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,856
Once elected officials are in power they have a vested interest

412
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,928
And keeping their districts exactly as they are because

413
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,976
Those are the districts that elected them

414
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,512
And fundamentally

415
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:01,888
Electoral Representatives knew that if they redrew the lines and they would be

416
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
Voting themselves out of a little

417
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Copower

418
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:10,336
ASCII Charles Professor Duke Law School

419
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,872
Not to do anything

420
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:17,504
So for the Liberals on the court they felt like this was a fundamental flaw in our democracy that needed to be fixed

421
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
And nobody was going to fix it if they didn't

422
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,464
Frankfurter he's like if you think of this one you can have to fix that one and that one and that one and that one and where is it going to stop

423
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,744
If you do this

424
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:34,656
There is no way out the Court's going to get stuck and what he called political Thicket

425
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,264
The political Thicket Court must not enter the political Thicket

426
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
Frank farina's Rittenhouse Square

427
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
The imagery of the

428
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
Ticket is that

429
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,176
You know the deer very proudly with

430
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
Corn

431
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Goes into

432
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
To the thicket

433
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,040
Gets entangled

434
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,832
Can never get out

435
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
Frankfurters Plainwell

436
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,208
Once the courts are in there will be nothing

437
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
Beyond it and someday

438
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:06,400
The courts will be forced to declare winners and losers a very high-profile election

439
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:12,800
Okay so after the oral arguments are over in Baker versus car

440
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:19,200
Are the justices head into conference that's a meeting with just the nine

441
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,296
Right down the middle and Charles Whitaker

442
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:26,368
He was a potential Swing Vote was deeply torn

443
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:32,512
Keepin leaning frankfurters way

444
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,048
A clear conscience

445
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Right

446
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,264
Finish the Spurs at first argument he asked a number of questions that suggested a great deal of sympathy with the plaintiff

447
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
Power

448
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
In the course

449
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:57,600
Constitutional right there's a lot of thought that he might actually come down on the side of of the plaintiffs in the case knives were Frankfurter really

450
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
Really baginda

451
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,696
Rip into a Justice Frankfurter

452
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Right after the first real argument

453
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
Event during the conference

454
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
Even 90 minutes

455
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Speech

456
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
Photographer

457
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,632
90 + straight minutes

458
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,960
Darting around the room pulling books off the shelves

459
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,752
Pulling books off the shelf

460
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,592
Reading from prior cases gesticulating wildly

461
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
To make its point

462
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,432
And the whole time looking directly at Whitaker

463
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,576
There was one account that I heard where Frankfurter went on for 4 hours

464
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:34,976
4 hours really lecturing Whitaker really really belittling him

465
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,280
Yes it was it was horribly intimidate

466
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,352
At one point

467
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,400
One of the justices on the liberal side

468
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,680
Justice Hugo Black

469
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:47,520
He took Whittaker side was trying to make him feel better

470
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:52,896
And black said to Charles Whitaker just remember we're all boys grown tall

471
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:57,504
We're not the gods who sit on high and dispense Justice

472
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,624
But it's very difficult not to see yourself in that role

473
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:07,488
Particularly if your vote might be the vote that decides everything

474
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,816
This started a weigh heavily on Whitaker's mind

475
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,984
He was disturbed by the by having the weight of Spring Court on his shoulders

476
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:24,640
According to his family Kate and Kent my mother tells me that he

477
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
At that time

478
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456
Was under a lot of stress

479
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:33,088
And spoke as though he were dictating spoke his punctuation

480
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:40,000
Hello Judas, it's very nice to meet you could clearly thinking about everything that he

481
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,840
Might say being recorded I remember his

482
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,632
Stating that he felt like

483
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:51,520
All the words that he ordered were being chiseled in stone as a result of Leaky Shed

484
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,056
You don't talk much

485
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:05,088
So after they heard the case the first time wudaokou couldn't make up his mind

486
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:09,184
And actually incidentally there is another Justice Justice Stewart

487
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:13,536
Who was the other Swing Vote in the case also couldn't make up his mind

488
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,376
The court decided to hear the case again in the fall

489
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
Just cuz they needed more time

490
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:26,080
And over the summer remain deeply divided that he actually

491
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,640
Written memos on both sides of the issue

492
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,248
Doug Smith says Whitaker wrote both and opinion for intervening in Baker vs. Carr

493
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,832
And a dissent against intervening in Baker versus car

494
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:43,488
At the same time as he circulates

495
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:49,888
60 page memo explaining how this was a political question that should not be decided by the chords

496
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
Please God

497
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,448
You know a fire in his belly

498
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
He's not going to let

499
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:54,496
This one go

500
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
Number 6

501
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
Charles W Baker at Alice Cullen

502
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:02,688
Monday October 9th 1961

503
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,760
It's 10 a.m. and the court is back in session

504
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:11,136
Lawyer arguing the case against the Tennessee legislature begin to talk

505
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,672
Federal courts

506
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Action

507
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,232
Frankfurter sit quietly for about

508
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
5 minutes listening

509
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
Without the light

510
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
And then

511
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,120
You don't need them

512
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:26,752
I know right

513
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,304
Frankfurter hammers the attorneys with questions

514
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
During the course of oral arguments

515
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:57,984
He speaks approximately 170 * 170 + 70

516
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,520
Charles Whitaker

517
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
Have some

518
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
For the allocation

519
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,664
Amish legislatures to dispatch

520
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,456
17 *

521
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
Well

522
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,344
After nearly four hours of oral arguments

523
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,696
The justice is recess and going to conference

524
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
Frankfurter needed

525
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Desperate

526
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
He had a good war

527
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
And he would tip

528
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
After him

529
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,656
Like a

530
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
Dog after a bone

531
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
Trying to persuade

532
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,520
And that

533
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
Harassing

534
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,080
Me. I have to make a point here

535
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
It was a nightmare

536
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,944
And I saw the night

537
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
How so describe it to me

538
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:44,832
Well

539
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,112
He was

540
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,976
A nervous wreck

541
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,024
And like a Cat on a Hot Tin Roof

542
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,352
I found out I don't know if he told me or his wife told me

543
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
He was on tranquilizer

544
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,424
Overcome

545
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
What he thought

546
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,728
Was just work related

547
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,520
Stress will clearly

548
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
Something

549
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
Was taking hold of him

550
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
Who had trouble concentrating

551
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,456
Highly fraught I would characterize

552
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
He is eventual breakdown

553
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,064
It's something of a slow descent

554
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
By the early spring

555
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,696
After the cord has return from its winter

556
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
Recess

557
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,536
Whitaker was absent from

558
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Court

559
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,936
You mean like he just didn't either getting show for work one day

560
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,960
Apparently so

561
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,240
Clerks didn't know where he

562
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
He was

563
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,056
The other justices

564
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,104
Didn't know his whereabouts

565
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
He just disappeared

566
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Really in the

567
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Little

568
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:45,760
Of what's going to become one of the

569
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,832
Monumental decisions of the 20th century

570
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
He disappears

571
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
She had to

572
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Escape

573
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Where'd you go

574
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
Well

575
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,096
He went to really what would be a cabin in the woods

576
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,144
In the middle of Wisconsin

577
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,008
He called up one of his former Los Associates in Kansas City.

578
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
Come up and join him

579
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
And according to Craig Smith

580
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,408
He in the sky whose name was Sam Milby

581
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
They would just

582
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,224
Set there

583
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,528
On the bank of the lake

584
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
In silence

585
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:35,936
They would sit for hours on end not talking to each other

586
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,664
Just waiting for the Justice to speak

587
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,304
We have no way of knowing what he was thinking at that moment but

588
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
I imagine he was just

589
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,680
Sitting there and he was thinking about these two realities that could unfold like

590
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,752
On the one hand if the court stepped into politics

591
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:15,872
They can protect people

592
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
But on the other hand

593
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,184
President with the set

594
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:33,024
Would it make the court too powerful

595
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,096
How much case

596
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,888
Do it protect the people

597
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,424
Has received

598
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:46,848
Images mine went back and forth and back and forth

599
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,920
Kurt decided he really had to get back to work than this

600
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,968
Protege would say to him

601
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
No just relax

602
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:58,624
Did you just take it easy and

603
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
Get yourself

604
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,696
Together before you decide to go back

605
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,352
After three weeks Justice Whitaker returns to DC

606
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Back to Washington

607
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,192
For a few days

608
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
But can't again his son

609
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,568
We found my father to be

610
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,616
Really in extremis

611
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,480
Debate and end I think I'm borderline suicidal

612
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,808
When you said that he was suicidal what do you mean

613
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,416
There was an instance in which my

614
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,000
Brother found my father going upstairs to get a shot

615
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
A few days later

616
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,288
Charles Whitaker check himself into a hospital

617
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,056
There is

618
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,920
Some evidence that it was really Justice Douglas Who convinced Whitaker

619
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,712
Go to the hospital

620
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,648
That's Justice William Douglas again

621
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:42,048
A few weeks later March 29th 1962

622
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:46,144
The presidential press conference from the new state department Auditorium

623
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,936
Washington DC

624
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
Several announcements to make

625
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
It is with extreme regret

626
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
That I announce the

627
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
Retirement of associate Justice of the Supreme

628
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Supreme Court

629
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,224
Charles Evans Whittaker

630
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Effective April

631
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
April 1st

632
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
Justice Whittaker

633
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:06,368
Remember the Supreme Court for nearly five years

634
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,416
Have the federal judiciary

635
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
Beignets

636
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,768
Is retiring at the direction of his position

637
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,560
Reasons of disability

638
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
I know that the bench in the Box

639
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
Of the entire nation

640
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,216
Join me in commending this to just

641
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Aquatica

642
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
First devoted service to his country

643
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,592
During a critical period and its history

644
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,688
Text I want to take this opportunity to

645
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
Distress again the in Fort

646
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
The tax bill now before the house representative

647
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
Wow

648
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,880
Whatever happened with the case with Bakery card

649
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,696
Whitaker didn't vote on Baker vs. Carr

650
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,000
So you could say that this case that

651
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
Essentially broken

652
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,816
His vote didn't count

653
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:53,984
Around the time that he was in the hospital there was sort of this liberal coup at the court where Frankfurter lost a couple of other vote

654
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,824
So in the end the decision actually wasn't very close at all

655
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,896
What was it it was 6 to

656
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,992
And Brennan wrote the majority opinion and he says that this whole

657
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,296
Kind of cluster that we've been fighting over

658
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,856
Apostates in Tennessee counter voters

659
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,184
But this is something the court can and should look at

660
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,232
So another words I decided to

661
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,024
Blow their horns and go into the thicket

662
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,328
Oh yeah they did

663
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,424
And just one or two final questions of what happened to Justice Frankfurter

664
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
The thing that I find

665
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,008
Crabs most extraordinary

666
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
Is it less than 2 weeks

667
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,616
After decision in Baker versus car came down

668
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,944
Felix Frankfurter was working at his desk at the Supreme

669
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,224
Concord and

670
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,528
Frankfurter secretary found him

671
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,576
Sprawled on the floor of his office

672
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:41,856
From a stroke

673
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
He suffered a massive stroke

674
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,464
And the never return to service

675
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,048
And while he was in the hospital solicitor-general Archer

676
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
Ballcock

677
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
Visit a Frankfurter

678
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
And Frankfurter

679
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
She was in a wheelchair

680
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
Could barely speak

681
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,728
But he

682
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,776
Apparently conveyed Archibald

683
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:03,360
That the decision maker versus

684
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,640
Skarhead essentially

685
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Caused his

686
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
He felt

687
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,808
So passionately

688
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,856
That the court should stay out of

689
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
The case

690
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,648
That Keef

691
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Physically

692
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
Physically deteriorated

693
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
After the court had gone the other way

694
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:40,992
After Baker vs. Carr President Kennedy essentially had to Supreme Court vacancies to fill

695
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,576
Now Whitaker seat he filled with a guy who turned out to be a moderate

696
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,648
Frankfurters vacancy that second vacancy

697
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:48,672
That vacant

698
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,440
Can see

699
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:54,560
That will lead to the appointment of a man named Arthur Goldberg

700
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,632
That is the fifth vote

701
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
That

702
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
The four liberals

703
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:04,800
What are regarded as the four liberals that becomes the fifth vote that they need

704
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
Really to create what has

705
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,432
Come to be regarded as the Warren Court Revolution

706
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:20,672
This is when the Supreme Court basically became an agent for social change

707
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,464
With the 1962 term

708
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,864
That's the revolution that is going to change

709
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,264
Are political boundaries prosecutor confession

710
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,664
Criminal justice the way we treat 1st Amendment

711
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,064
Religious and obscenity issues that's the Warren court that people remain

712
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
Remember

713
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:54,464
And that's the court that came into existence when Felix Frankfurter left

714
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:02,656
I'm so just thinking about that question that that woman asked all the way at the beginning of the story

715
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:05,984
Could you address what I see is the

716
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,544
Increasing politicization

717
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,616
Of the Court the apotheosis of which I guess was

718
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,432
Yoona voting

719
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,968
OLX in Bush

720
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
To be a hour

721
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,296
President you can

722
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,136
Kind of draw a line from this moment in Baker versus car

723
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,208
All the way to December 9th 2000

724
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:32,352
Holes in six new states have just closed and the lead story at this hour is

725
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,120
The state

726
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
Florida

727
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,912
Is 2

728
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
Close

729
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,496
I think Felix Frankfurter would have said

730
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,520
See

731
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,616
That's what I told you that's what would happen

732
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:48,224
Is that eventually you will you will be deciding a partisan

733
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
Which

734
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
Presidential candidate

735
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:53,856
Essentially received the most votes

736
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,952
For those who help themselves on the losing side of bush V Gore

737
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
This was

738
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,512
Justice Frankfurter

739
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
This was the moment

740
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
Bad

741
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,936
Baker V Carr

742
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
And

743
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
When I teach this to

744
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Students

745
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,848
Particularly in the decade

746
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
After Bush V Gore

747
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,944
Sent sent

748
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
Sentiments about the

749
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
This was still quite Raw

750
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
I would say to them well

751
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:24,832
Is this

752
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,112
Was Frankfurter right

753
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,184
And I remember a student in the mid

754
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
Mm

755
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:30,976
Who said

756
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,280
In class I never thought I would

757
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,048
Say this

758
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:34,816
But

759
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
I hated the outcome of bush

760
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
Precor I was so angry

761
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
Proceeded

762
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,960
But if

763
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:43,008
Bush V Gore is the price we have to

764
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
To pay for

765
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,080
The courts making the overall

766
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
System

767
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
Work

768
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,664

00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:51,968
Surprise him with

771
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:59,392
If we totally sign off what happened

772
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:05,792
The Douglas Weiser lost track I am so after Baker vs. Carr was decided he went on to be a Supreme Court Justice for three

773
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:12,192
13 more years and to this day he actually holds the record for being the longest-serving justice of all time 36

774
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,592
Frankfurter Baker vs. Carr was the last case that he ever heard

775
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:24,992
And he died a few years afterwards recover

776
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:31,392
After Whitaker retired from the court he moved back to Kansas City with his family and his son said that it took them about

777
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:37,792
2 years to get better from his nervous breakdown but he did get better and eventually he got a job as counsel.

778
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
The General Motors but

779
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,632
