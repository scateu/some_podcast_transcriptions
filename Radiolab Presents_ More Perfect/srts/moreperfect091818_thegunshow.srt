WNYC Studios

00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:10,240
This is more perfect I'm jad abumrad

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,776
Season 3 of more perfect

4
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,824
We're releasing an album

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,384
Service song cycle of the amendments

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
United States,

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,432
Institution

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,480
And we're telling stories about each of those men

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,016
Some of you might recall

10
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,040
The last season

11
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:24,832
We did a deep dive

12
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,112
On the 2nd

13
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
We're going to rebroadcast

14
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
For you now it

15
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,232
Comes from Shaun Robbins firm

16
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,560
He hosts an amazing show called today explained

17
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,144
Really did a stint with us hear it more perfect

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,912
Second chance

19
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:45,824
I think we should start with one of the most confusing sentences in the constitution in the Bill of Rights not We the People

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
Not that one I got

21
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,408
A well regulated militia

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,432
,

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,224
Being necessary

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
To the security

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
Of a free state

26
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
,

27
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
The right of the people to

28
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
Keep and bear arms

29
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,416
,

30
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,464
Shall not be infringed

31
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
Salem

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,304
And do it do it with the commas

33
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,120
Sure a well regulated militia

34
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,960
, being necessary to the security

35
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
Of a free state

36
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,848
Oh, the right of the people to keep and bear arms

37
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,664
Totally unnecessary,

38
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
Shall not be infringed

39
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,504
Is that the one that's about guns

40
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,368
Adam Winkler who wrote the book on on the 2nd Amendment end of book is called gunfight he's a journalist

41
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,928
He's a professor of law at UCLA

42
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,768
He said it's almost as if James Madison the author of the amendment I just

43
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,072
Discovered this wonderful new thing the,

44
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,120
And wanted to put it in there as many times

45
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,680
Which is like

46
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
A nerdy professorial joke

47
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
But like seriously what is it in like

48
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,920
It had to be this one come to the Bendy Amendment about like quartering soldiers in your house that was really confusing

49
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,200
Guns that they made like chest

50
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,248
Indecipherable and ever since

51
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,552
Generations of Americans have been confused

52
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
By the language of the Second Amendment

53
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
So when the song was written we had just fought this war with the British

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
Is Revolutionary War

55
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,768
And they try to win it right from the get-go

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
Bike coming for our guns

57
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,144
So these new states are looking at this new federal government they're going

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,728
We don't know we want to trust you quite yet so there's the second amendment that says

59
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
You guys can fight back

60
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
Like the feds are going to disarm you you can your malicious

61
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
That's

62
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
I think what we agree on

63
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,944
But then after that you just look at the sentence

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,968
That is not just a

65
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
Comments that are confusing

66
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
If you look at the sentence

67
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
As a whole

68
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,832
Pieces don't seem to

69
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Get together

70
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
There's some noun confusion

71
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
I mean

72
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,000
It's obvious that the sentence is about someone's right to bear arms but who

73
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
Who get that right

74
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
At the beginning of the sentence

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,888
You got a well regulated militia

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Demolition

77
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,704
States have a right to form militias

78
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
Jets to assemble

79
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,288
Groups of people and those people got to have their guns

80
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,312
That's easy enough

81
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
But then later the sentence there's

82
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,896
Oh, the right of the people

83
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
To keep and bear arms

84
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
,

85
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
Shall not be infringed

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,248
The people

87
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,296
Which people

88
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
Those people over there in the militia

89
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
All people

90
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,160
If you mean all people

91
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Why'd you say militia

92
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
It's like

93
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:14,304
The first Clause seems to point to some sort of collective right to bear arms

94
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
And the second clause

95
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,912
Seems to point to some individual right to bear arms

96
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
Life is supposed to be a popularly ratified document

97
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,312
It's actually not that easy to read

98
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,360
But it's not it wasn't that easy to read then

99
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,640
This is Jill Lepore

100
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,176
Staff writer at the New Yorker magazine

101
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
She's also a professor of American

102
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
I studied 18th century

103
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,880
I'm really trying in the seventeenth and eighteenth century American political

104
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
And Jill says

105
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,256
From the beginning when people thought about the Second Amendment they tend to

106
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
To just focus

107
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
On the first part

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,864
That the primary motivation for the amendment is

109
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,936
About militia well-regulated militia

110
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,520
But this confusing sentence was widely read as

111
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
This Collective

112
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
Melissa Wright

113
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
Not an individual one truth

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
Did the Second Amendment facts

115
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
Guarantees the right of an individual to

116
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
To bear arms in that the government federal government

117
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
In any fashion

118
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Juices

119
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
I just didn't exist

120
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
I disagree with the way you characterize

121
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
That although what you said is

122
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,887
Stated in the media frequently Stephen halbrook he's represented the NRA in several

123
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,215
I've written several books on Second Amendment issues

124
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,007
He actually thinks a

125
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,031
The sentence is just

126
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
Is fine as is I don't think it's complicated at all the framers were thinking about an individual right

127
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,503
The Second Amendment refers to the right of the people to

128
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,367
First Amendment refers to the right of the people peaceably to assemble

129
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,743
I mean who is that it did this individuals or not some kind of collected that doesn't exist in reality

130
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,791
So which was it

131
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095
That that's a really good question to add I mean

132
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,423
It's complicated 1/2 what I can tell you is that

133
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
No people I spoke to for the

134
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,471
The story said

135
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,823
At least in the 20th century when the when the second amendment was taught in law schools

136
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
It was taught this

137
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,151
It was taught as a sort of antiquated

138
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,687
Outdated

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,479
Thing that have to do with malicious

140
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,271
It's not so much individual rights

141
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,295
But

142
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,647
Stephen halbrook and their respective side something they can both agree on

143
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,927
Is that this

144
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,767
Super sacred Second Amendment the third rail

145
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,047
Of our American pilot

146
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,607
6 day. Just was not a thing

147
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,959
It was not like that it was utterly ignored ignored

148
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:29,983
This amendment

149
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
When I Was An undergraduate

150
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,847
Undergrad at Florida State University went to the forest

151
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,967
Supreme Court and start looking up law review articles on constitutional law issues and I found that

152
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,623
There was hardly anything written about the Second Amendment amendment that was less

153
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
Written about less

154
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,207
Legislated less activated

155
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
Lessa subject of Supreme Court conversation and the Second Amendment

156
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,887
Didn't think about guns

157
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,751
People had guns States regulated guns but for most of our history the Second Amendment

158
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
It was like

159
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
Luxardo runt of the Bill of Rights glitter like no one argued about it it's a striking thing to eat to think about

160
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
There was no fight

161
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,735
No fight how surprising that

162
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
It is given its centrality to our

163
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Political car

164
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Versation today

165
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
What is

166
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Extraordinary

167
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,183
Because there was this window

168
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Time work

169
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
All of this

170
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Changes that the script

171
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,047
Just flips

172
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
There's two hundred years

173
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
Everything being chill

174
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
And then suddenly

175
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,191
You got

176
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
This

177
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
I want say those fighting words

178
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,591
From my cold dead hands

179
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,575
Gabriel So basically in

180
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,599
The Flash

181
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
The Second Amendment goes from being

182
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,671
Ignored

183
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:55,231
To be

184
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,279
Supposed to be Radioactive

185
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
And in the process

186
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:10,079
We start to read the thing totally differently all of a sudden this is hotly debated thing that's got nothing to do with

187
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
That first part

188
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
And everything

189
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
To do

190
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:15,199

And me

194
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,439
What are the Second Amendment people maybe there is that

195
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,255
But what I want to know is how did that happen

196
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,119
How do we start reading the Second Amendment the way we do now

197
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,703
And and what I found out is that

198
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,775
In the modern history of the gun rights movement and

199
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,335
And how we read the second amendment can be boiled down to these

200
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
3

201
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,383
Totally

202
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,199

00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
And finally

207
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
Number three

208
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
A reckoning

209
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,655

00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:21,919
I was extra shower guns when I was 12 years old I was raised a hunter and a fisherman

227
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,223
Besides being a carpenter and a builder

228

The Black Panther

238
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:59,039
Yeah so this transition from the militia to the individual my right to bear arms

239
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
You could argue that

240
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
That whole individual gun rights movements

241
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Started

242
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,183
In the

243
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
With the Black Panthers

244
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,631
In Oakland it's an unlikely and kind of surprising origin for what's known as the individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment

245
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:20,031
We would different breathe well read guys we do you know I history

246
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,823
Context is 1966

247
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
It's been

248
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,199
An exceptionally bad time for race relations all over the country

249
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,551
More than 1500 people were in the

250
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:35,391
Attack dogs and hoses

251
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:41,791
And in particular the tension between

252
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:48,191
Black community and police

253
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,775
60s high profile incidents

254
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,871
Of Officer shooting unarmed black man this is what was happening

255
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,919
You know and

256
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
What we did

257
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,247
Is that yet we took a position

258
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
October 1966

259
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,743
Bicillin is friend Huey P Newton they start this organization called the black panthers black panther party for self-defense

260
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Defense

261
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:17,375
Fue Bobby's co-founder was 2 years in law school

262
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,215
You was going to the University of San Francisco School of Law

263
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,567
And one day he's sitting there as as you do law school thinking about the law

264
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,383
Think about Malcolm X thinking about what he can do in Oakland

265
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
And it hits

266
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,735
The Second Amendment of the Constitution guarantees

267
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
The citizen's right to bear arms

268
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,831
On public property

269
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,927
But they can argue that the Second Amendment gave them a right

270
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:47,327
Have a gun he said that's a constitutional Democratic civil human right

271
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,631
There's always been those who claim that

272
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Second Amendment

273
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:55,263
Protecting an individual right to bear arms who argued that were in the minority

274
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
They want taken

275
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,383
Too seriously this was one of the first times that the individual rights reading was

276
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Forced into

277
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
The mainstream because

278
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
We have a right to bear arms

279
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
We individuals

280
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
Then

281
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
We can control the police

282
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,439
Observe the police

283
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,767
Tell him that we control the police

284
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,119
What do eagles do you in law school so what legal status do we have

285
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,471
That second half of the Second Amendment right to bear arms

286
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,335
Possessing bear arms okay he also pointed to a California state law

287
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,479
It said you could carry a gun as long as it wasn't concealed the gun is not concealed is not illegal

288
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:39,807
So the Black Panthers started policing the police

289
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
We did

290
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:48,255
It would go out in arms patrols and follow police car on 7th Street

291
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:54,655
West Oakland California nightlife District police officer pulled over

00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
And walked over to them and said

308
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,847
You have no right to observe me

309
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,711

00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,975
Racist police agencies throughout the country are intensifying the terror

372
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,999
Brutality

373
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:34,303
Murder and repression of black people

374
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Etcetera

375
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:41,983
While he was reading that uniform Capital guards come running out grab Ronald Reagan

376
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,823
Took him in the opposite direction from us away from the kids

377
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,591
Okay

378
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
Is it we decided to go inside

379
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
Because

380
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
December

381
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
Was in session at the time

382
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Next thing I know

383
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,295
We all loading

384
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,575
Laundry elevator

385
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,159
He is shotgun rifles pointing up cameras in there

386
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Crowded

387
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,975
Body touching body Crowder

388
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,071
When they got off the elevator he asked him which way to the spectator section

389
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:12,447
So the Panthers could watch the legislature debate the bill somebody says this way to the right

390
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
And so I walk into this door

391
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,543
And as I walk into the door

392
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,895
The president pro temp in the State Assembly win the actual

393
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,991
Close the Sims this is not the goddamn spectator section

394
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,343
I said come on get the hell out of here man win the wrong goddamn place

395
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
Walking to the state capitol

396
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,671
Rashad Evans

397
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:38,559
And then all hell breaks

398
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
Am I underweight

399
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,399
Take your hands off me

400
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,263
I turn around and I see

401
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
State Assembly NY State Assembly ducking down behind their deaths

402
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,271
Is this the way the racist government work don't let a man exercises

403
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
Is constitutional rights

404
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
I can point to this

405
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:07,487
Forgotten unknown moment here in the State Building in Sacramento

406
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
I've liked the game changer

407
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,119
For the conversation about guns in America

408
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
Because suddenly

409
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:22,335
Overnight we will on the front pages of newspapers around the world who are

410
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,735
Ragtag organization with this International notoriety in being introduced

411
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Most of the world

412
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
You had a lot of people going

413
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Wait what

414
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
Like there's a bunch of black man rolling around with guns

415
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:41,279
Walking into the Capitol Building when there's kids around what came of that that provided

416
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,839
The law said no one

417
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,655
Could carry a loaded weapon

418
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,703
Inside city limits

419
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,287
Within a hundred fifty feet of public property

420
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:55,359
This was directed at the Black Panthers we know it was

421
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,943
The people have all kinds of opinions about the Black Panthers and what they did

422
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:05,599
Particularly after Huey Newton shooting happened at 5 a.m. later that same year was arrested for shooting

423
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:11,231
And killing a cop approved blood marks the spot where twenty-three-year-old officer John Frey

424
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
Was found fatally wound

425
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,815
The case was eventually dismissed but

426
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,887
What seems clear is that the Black Panthers decision

427
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
To use the Second Amendment

428
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,983
To arm themselves to show up armed

429
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,799
At the state capitol in California inspired

430
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
A big risk backlash

431
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
FBI director J Edgar Hoover today asserted that the Black Panthers represent the greatest internal threat to the nation

432
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Birkenstock

433
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,111
A Revolution was about to break out right here at home

434
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
This led to a whole new wave of gun control laws in California but also Federal gun-control nanny of

435
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Seemed

436
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,607
To be targeted towards African-Americans

437
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,911
Rather than just reducing gun violence

438
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,703
America was like

439
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,263
We've got to get guns off the streets

440
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,359
But the irony was even though those laws were designed to

441
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Disarm

442
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,943
Left-leaning black radicals

443
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,015
Many white rural conservatives

444
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,111
Thought that they were next

445
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,951
The government was going to take their guns next

446
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Every action

447
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Create a reaction

448
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
And at the same time that the Panthers thing is

449
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,679
Hitting front pages of newspapers

450
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
Around the world

451
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,567
You got a assassinations you got race riots you got Vietnam protest

452
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
All of a sudden everyone's clamoring for gun control

453
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
Democrats

454
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
And Republicans

455
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
In fact

456
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,271
Why out on the street

457
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,807
Fideo

458
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Civilian should be

459
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,111
Carrying a loaded weapon

460
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,695
That was the exact same day

461
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,047
At the Black Panthers showed up at state capitol in Sacramento with their shotgun

462
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,143
Reagan Reagan was into gun control Reagan's got his fingerprints all over this

463
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,679
What's Happening Here

464
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:00,543
Is the Black Panther show up in the Capitol Sacramento and Ron Reagan react

465
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
They create some gun control

466
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,663
Then there's even more gun control even federal gun control

467
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
And a lot of people are sitting home watching this

468
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
And they start to get very

469
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
Upset

470
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Which brings us

471
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
2 chapter 2

472
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
The revolt

473
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,000
You know we can't allow this to happen

474
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
I can buy the damn pistol that I want to buy

475
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,424
These two guys John aquilino live in Rockport Texas

476
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,728
Joseph turow Buffalo New York

477
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,568
They get us there and they've both been in the guns pretty much their entire lives

478
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
Fatherless

479
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,640
Veteran

480
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
World War 1

481
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,224
Did some recreational shooting with

482
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,552
My mother and I used to love to go to the amusement park

483
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,368
And spend all day shooting with 22

484
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,208
Little things that moved in the shooting gallery but neither one of them

485
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,256
Particularly hardcore about their dumb beliefs

486
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,792
Until around the time

487
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,816
The Black Panther

488
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,936
Give me the fact that here bunch of people who were

489
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,288
Slightly darker complected than New England

490
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,824
Ivy league grads

491
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,408
Running around with Firearms at the did that scare people

492
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
Hell yes

493
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
Did it scare you

494
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,504
I didn't scare me I did

495
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
John told me

496
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Joe is well that

497
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,648
It wasn't the Panthers themselves that were the problem I don't like anybody

498
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,744
That tells me I can't do something is all the gun control laws that came

499
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
In the wake

500
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,072
When the gun control Act

501
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Repasts

502
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,376
68

503
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,936
Today we begin to disarm the criminal

504
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Carolyn

505
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
And then say

506
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:39,872
A lot of things just appeared that I had been used to Joe said he starts the gun shops in his neighborhood

507
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
Close

508
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,968
Like the furniture store in Buffalo that used to have shotgun

509
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,016
$5 think they stop selling them

510
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,576
And he says that is really bothered him because

511
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
The reason you have a gun

512
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,208
Is for protection another form of insurance

513
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,072
Which wasn't an abstract idea for him buffalo in the 60s and 70s

514
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,096
Not the thief

515
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
Best place in the world

516
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
His house

517
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
Was even broken into

518
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,216
I can only describe as

519
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
Wangjing beijing

520
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:07,776
He's got extra

521
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
Better

522
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Their way

523
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:10,848
2 Doors

524
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,688
Joseph seen his wife and his dog huddled in one room with a gun

525
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,992
Wally's two guys storm through his house

526
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
And Rod

527
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
I think they grade my wife

528
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Purse

529
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Some other money

530
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
And they are

531
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
I mean by the time the police got there

532
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
David Bond

533
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,840
Jose whole relationship with Firearms disorder predicated upon that

534
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,864
This idea that it's

535
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
For self-defense

536
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
And here he's got

537
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,216
People breaking into his house

538
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
He's got

539
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,288
The cops not being there for him

540
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,848
He's got the government trying to take his gun away so

541
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
What do you do

542
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,432
You join the n

543
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
AR

544
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,224
Hey then I join

545
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Flight discounts

546
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
But

547
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,624
This came at a moment where the NRA was at this

548
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
Crossroads online

549
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,464
Any edit seen before

550
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,488
Orson

551
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,888
Back when Joe joined in the early 70s the NRA

552
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
Was not the diehards

553
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
Supporter of gun rights

554
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Let me know today

555
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
Because according to Adam Winkler

556
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:16,128
It was never meant to be the idea behind the NRA

557
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
To be fundamental right down

558
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,992
Today was to increase Civilian Marksmanship training

559
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,552
So that the next time there's a war Americans would be

560
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
Capable of fighting it

561
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,648
You know you don't hear much about the NRA's founders

562
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:34,048
But the NRA was formed in the 1870s right after the Civil War by a reporter for the New York Times

563
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,656
Who thought that the Union Soldiers had been so ineffective

564
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,728
In the Civil War because they were not familiar with firearms

565
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,008
Really yeah

566
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
But a hundred years their main focus was

567
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,152
Like teaching Boy Scouts how to shoot straight not the Second Amendment

568
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,992
And apparently if you go back through issues of American Rifleman

569
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
40s

570
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
50s

571
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
Are the enemies version of Playboy guns instead of

572
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:03,232
Girls you'll be amazed that you can't find a single mention of the Second Amendment anywhere in those magazine

573
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,792
The NRA at that point was

574
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,096
Sort of like a gun trade group they work

575
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,168
Not super political and and the people who ran it

576
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
They were Hunters

577
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
John Hunt

578
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:19,616
They were just like these wealthy businessmen who like to hunt according to Joe guys who

579
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
Yeah they were hobbyist

580
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:26,016
You had all these people coming in like Joe and like John who were convinced

581
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
The guns weren't about

582
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,856
Shooting ducks they were about Schultz

583
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,416
Protecting yourself against criminals

584
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,976
In a time of starkly Rising crime rate

585
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,024
And this would lead to this straight up

586
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
Head on collision

587
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
At the NRA

588
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
Now

589
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,192
Joe and John join the NRA

590
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
The organization address

591
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
For the first

592
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
Time

593
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,312
So to set up this lobbying are

594
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:53,152
Yeah it was the brand new Institute for legislative action

595
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:56,992
John actually got hired to work there in 1976

596
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,552
And this true for legislative action

597
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
Supposed to fight for gun rights

598
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,416
Stop Chapel Hill that's what they both wanted to do but

599
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,696
Let's put it this way

600
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
We were the

601
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,512
If you would the bastards

602
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,536
Step-children

603
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
What's the National Rifle Association

604
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Really

605
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,168
Yeah when the institute for legislative action

606
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,728
Was formed in 1975

607
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,752
The NRA

608
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,544
Refuse the insta

609
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,568
Attitude NE

610
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,592
Office Space

611
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
In the building

612
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:27,200
In the mid-seventies the part of the NRA that Lobby politicians

613
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:32,320
Had to rent office space from the hotel next door to the NRA

614
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Is crazy

615
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
And then

616
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,184
Right after he was hired 78 people

617
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Fire

618
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,536
Very interesting lady big firing

619
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
And then there was word

620
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
Did the NRA want

621
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
Wave Wash

622
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:51,008
Selva headquarters there and moved Colorado Springs

623
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,568
What's in Colorado Springs

624
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,896
Camp they were going to move to headquarters and put it in there this

625
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,200
Olympic sports training group

626
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:03,808
So that they could then start writing all the magazines about all the Olympics

627
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Sports

628
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,648
They really didn't know what the hell they were doing they wanted to

629
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
Turn the NRA from

630
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
Organization of firearms owners

631
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
2

632
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,328
A Publishing Company

633
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:17,120
They wanted to get I was just

634
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,144
Politics

635
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,984
The older guard didn't seem to have the stomach for whatever done fight

636
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,824
Some members wanted to hat they were very moderate they thought like

637
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,104
Maybe we should try and kind of

638
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,408
Get out of this hole gun business plan

639
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,712
Not just kind of getting out

640
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,504
John says there's even a moment when

641
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,880
A report surface that suggested we should change the name of the association

642
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Really

643
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,464
Yeah they were going to take rifle out

644
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,792
Tell me more tell me everything

645
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,632
Do you remember what any of those proposed names or no

646
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,936
But they were considering at least taking rifle out

647
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
Oh yeah

648
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728

00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,224

There are four

711
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,040
When it came time for the members part of the meeting where

712
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,368
Members submit proposals which happens in like this

713
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,416
Super parliamentary sorta way

714
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,952
This guy Neil Knox

715
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,280
He was part of their group kind of bullrush the mic

716
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
And he said

717
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,400
The Gather members have a list of bylaws

718
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
Did they would like to have voted on

719
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
Translation

720
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,264
Bugattis 15 demand

721
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,312
15 demands

722
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,640
Not sure if it's more or less than Martin Luther

723
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,480
Basically number one we demand that the NRA not move

724
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:48,576
Cancel that the institute for legislative action which

725
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,600
You want to kill

726
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,904
Should have more power through hell yes

727
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Hell yeah

728
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,000
And we demand that the current NRA leadership

729
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
Beer place

730
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
We wanted to take over

731
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,144
So the Federation guys making all these demands

732
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
What was

733
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
Crazy

734
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:07,264
Was that the leadership of the NRA

735
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,056
That was one of the meetings they just sat

736
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
They they were like

737
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,408
Dumbfounded

738
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:20,576
But every time the Federation guy would make a motion judge Porter would say no do I have a say

739
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,344
Second

740
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,136
Okay the most

741
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,440
Has been a debate would be

742
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,256
Would start to speak for and against each men

743
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,072
The Federation members will use their walkie-talkies

744
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,120
Coordinate who spoke at what microphone

745
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,912
How many votes did you need that day

746
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,960
I think this leash.

747
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:43,360
And how many votes did you think you had if you needed 600 so how many did you think it we hadn't the slightest idea

748
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,688
Going in we anticipated

749
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,712
50/50

750
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Lisa pork

751
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,624
So as each of the 15 amendments are being debated the insurrectionists are running around in their orange caps with their walkie-talkies

752
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,952
Discussion debate

753
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,232
Blessed eight

754
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,048
Hours from 7 p.m.

755
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:04,352
For 5 in the morning 4 a.m.

756
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
And nobody love

757
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
They were all there

758
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
There were

759
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,032
I mean we really didn't know whether to pull this off

760
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,848
But Joe says one of the big turning points

761
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,712
Is when a guy named Bob Kukla gets up to the mic he was at the time the head

762
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,016
Of the institute for legislative action

763
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
You get into the mic

764
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,064
And

765
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
He

766
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:31,232
Play the tape cassette tapes right this was one that Bob Kukla secretly recorded I don't know how he did it.

767
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:37,376
You here on this tape is Bob Kukla talking to his bosses at the NRA and they're yelling at him berating him

768
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Or going to war

769
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
Every time somebody

770
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
He talks about guns

771
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,776
The reason we like Bob

772
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,568
Shut up

773
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,360
He had to take there and

774
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,640
You played it over the

775
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
And of course that electric

776
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,480
Defied the odds

777
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,528
Do you could actually hear people

778
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Gasping

779
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
The rank-and-file

780
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,112
Audibly

781
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,904
This was this was evident

782
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
The other side

783
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,232
Is going to deep six

784
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
The gunman

785
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
Metro fights

786
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,072
People

787
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
On the tape they're all in the room

788
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Oh yeah

789
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
There's sister sitting next to him

790
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
The table

791
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,264
Over the course of this one nine our meeting

792
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,568
On a hot steamy night in Cincinnati

793
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,128
Every single one of those 50 proposals

794
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,152
Was passed

795
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
We stopped the building in Colorado

796
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,272
Ensure the answer I wouldn't change its name

797
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:30,112
Expired the leadership just like the political savant

798
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,184
That figure that Hillary is going to get the presidency

799
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
They just

800
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,768
Absolutely took it in their shorts

801
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,840
And maybe the biggest change the most important change

802
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
Was that

803
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,168
The Institute for legislative action this

804
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,472
Political lobbying arm of the NRA

805
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
It was given the keys

806
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
To the car

807
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
They were not

808
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
The bass

809
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,384
Bastard stepchild anymore they were

810
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:53,408
The NRA

811
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
You know what

812
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
We won and essentially

813
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
Staged

814
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,296
What are they called 1776

815
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,832
It's the same thing

816
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,136
When the sun rose the very next day

817
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
The NRA have

818
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,232
Whole new board

819
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
Committed

820
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
To a new

821
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
No compromises

822
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328
Does view of the sacrament

823
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,680
Individuals have a right not only to have a gun but to have

824
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,240
Almost any gun that they want and have as many of them

825
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
I can take those guns

826
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
Almost anyplace they want

827
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,616
American Gun Parts

828
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,664
Literally changed overnight

829
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,968
And just shortly after this coup

830
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,248
The NRA

831
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,016
Both

832
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:34,624
This Abridged version of the Second Amendment right on the wall front center and its head coach

833
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
The Rite of

834
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:38,208
People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

835
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,488
Nice clean

836
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,280
Totally uncomplicated

837
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,584
Conveniently left out was the

838
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,144
The part that talked about a well regulated militia

839
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,168
Be necessary for

840
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
Security of a

841
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Free state

842
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,800
I asked John like what about the militia part of the set

843
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:58,944
Why doesn't the NRA ever talk about that now you get me back to asking you if

844
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,016
John I love you dearly trust me

845
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
But

846
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,880
It's only been in less what 30 years

847
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,184
That if you'll pardon the expression

848
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,536
The b******* media has turned the militia into a four-letter word

849
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:16,096
The militia is you and me Sean

850
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
Post-coup

851
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:25,568
The NRA took a very hard line on gun control

852
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,896
And became an irrepressible political force in America

853
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:33,248
Grandinfo agree the NRA's power to scare congressman

854
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:38,112
Lies and its ability to mobilize its members in any congressional district

855
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,160
The touch of a computer button

856
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:44,000
They start pouring millions of dollars into lobbying NJ

857
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,304
A few years after that Cincinnati revolt

858
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,632
The NRA endorses its first presidential candidate

859
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,448
The Constitution does not say

860
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,752
The government shall decree

861
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,544
The right to keep and bear arms

862
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,312
Reagan

863
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:03,712
Reagan the Constitution says the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be

864
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,480
French

865
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:09,344
At this point everyone and their Uncle leaves out the militia Park

866
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,368
Of the Second Amendment

867
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,440
Which is why Americans eventually start to forget that

868
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,512
The militia clause or whatever you want to call it even exist

869
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,072
I wish I could save that instead of the last

870
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:24,960
One of these at most surprised me when I was doing some research this is julep

871
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
By the 1990s

872
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:30,080
The new interpretation of the Second Amendment had so penetrated

873
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,616
Popular opinion

874
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,944
That people were more familiar with the Second Amendment then with the

875
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,224
Best Buy 1990s

876
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,528
The First Amendment

877
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
That Eclipse really

878
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:41,856
Kind of shock

879
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:48,256
But even if you did the Panthers and the president in the American people are all down to sort of forget about this militia

880
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
Clause of the 2nd Amendment

881
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
It didn't mean a lot without the courts

882
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
And of course

883
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
Particularly the Supreme Court

884
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
Woodbine

885
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,080
The US Supreme Court from 1969 to 1986

886
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,104
Warren Burger

887
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,688
Song giving a television interview and he says that this new interpretation is it

888
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,968
Second amendment was

889
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:13,344
What are the greatest pieces of fraud I repeat the word fraud

890
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,648
On the American public

891
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,696
That I have ever seen in my life

892
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,024
And this was a republican appointed by

893
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,072
Richard Nixon now

894
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
Yeah

895
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,168
Yeah so the Supreme Court obviously not

896
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,472
Dying to have this conversation at the moment

897
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,800
But it's not just the Supreme Court if you look at the federal courts the entire

898
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
Federal court system in America

899
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:39,200
That there's not once in our history at this point over 200 years

900
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,992
Been a single instance

901
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,064
Of some gun law some State local gun law

902
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,904
Getting up to a court and the court going you know what you can't do this

903
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
It violates the second amendment that does not even happen

904
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,488
Really

905
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:56,608
Not even the weather like in Mammoth Smackdown anywhere in federal court this isn't this isn't a thing

906
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
Current Supreme Court to weigh in on it

907
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,520
That doesn't even look like it could be a thing it doesn't even look like much more than a fantasy

908
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
Until

909
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
For gun owners there

910
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
Q names

911
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,640
Become synonymous

912
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,920
Protecting our rights

913
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
Ladies and Gentlemen please welcome

914
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,248
A true patriot

915
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,016
Dick Heller

916
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,624
Dick Heller showed up

917
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
Freedom

918
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
Twitter

919
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:28,096
And changed everything everywhere out there

920
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:04,448
More perfect will continue in a moment

921
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:22,528
Heller in 2008 revives the Second Amendment or you could even say

922
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,928
Breathes life into the Second Amendment because the Second Amendment

923
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,768
Had never been taken truly seriously by

924
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
My federal courts

925
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,584
Until 2008

926
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:41,728
That Cindy levenson professor at the University of Texas law school

927
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,568
This is my perfect I'm Chatham Rod here with Sean Roberts firm

928
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592
Price of Sean

929
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,360
Chad

930
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:51,712
It's I guess now it's time for chapter 3 to kill a right they were going to get to dick

931
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
But first

932
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
Here's what's going on in America

933
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,832
2nd Amendment has become

934
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,136
One of those issues that can get you elected

935
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,416
Academic

936
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,488
Have begun to have a vigorous debate about its meaning

937
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
But the Supreme Court

938
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,304
Is still staying out of it

939
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,096
They're leaving this up to the states

940
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,168
Which already have all sorts of gun laws of their own to deal

941
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
But then December 12th

942
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:17,312
2000 Republican George W Bush become president elect

943
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:23,712
After divided US Supreme Court has effectively halts recount in Florida contested presidential vote tally

944
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,248
George W bush is elected

945
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,296
The NRA likes George W bush

946
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,832
National Rifle Association

947
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,112
And he likes

948
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:30,880
The proud history

949
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
I protecting

950
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
II am in

951
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,208
To the United States cost

952
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:40,608
Petition and in 2001 the Bush Administration declared that the Second Amendment protected an individual

953
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
Right to own guns

954
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,936
UCLA law professor Adam Winkler

955
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,984
Again right that was not limited

956
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,520
Is most courts have held

957
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,544
The service in the militia

958
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:53,663
And almost right after he gets into office Bush's Attorney General John Ashcroft

959
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,687
Put out a letter

960
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:58,527
This public letter to the NRA announcing that the Department of Justice

961
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,855
Adopted a new interpretation of the Second Amendment

962
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,207
And then right around the same time as the Bush Administration memo came out

963
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
4

964
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Texas

965
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:13,119
Ruled that the Second Amendment did protect an individual right to bear arms

966
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
And that was a first

967
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
The big deal

968
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,191
Before this

969
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,727
All the decisions of kind of

970
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:19,007
Beard in the other direction

971
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,311
And because of that Court ruling

972
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
And John Ashcroft letter

973
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,407
List three libertarian lawyers

974
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
Alan gura

975
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,991
Constitutional attorney

976
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,015
Bob Levy

977
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
A chair the board at the Cato

978
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:37,951
Toot and Clark neily thought the timing was right we thought it was a good time for some litigation

979
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,511
I want thing you need to know about these guys is that they weren't

980
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:46,655
Family doing it for the guns they had no association with the NRA or the gun rights movement for them it was

981
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:52,287
More about getting the government to back off in our country when the government wants to restrict our Liberty

982
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:57,663
It isn't coming on the government to make the case for it isn't coming on the government to say here's why you shouldn't be permitted

983
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
To exercise that right

984
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,223
So that was their angle

985
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:05,343
Always wondered why the gun rights movement has become such a proxy war for like anti-government

986
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,111
Mint

987
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:10,207
Is Mmm Yeah well I mean if you think about this something professor

988
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,999
Sandy Levinson told me

989
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,327
Is that sort of embedded in this amendment

990
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
That is

991
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:20,959
The very idea that you can take up arms against the governor

992
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,495
Protect yourself

993
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,287
And your fellow man from tyranny

994
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,823
On the far right

995
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,383
Or occasionally on the far left

996
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,943
You find people who are willing

997
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,711
2

998
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,759
Say this that this is really what

999
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,783
Terrific about

1000
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
The Second Amendment

1001
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:39,647
But mainstream conservatives in mainstream liberals

1002
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
Arnott

1003
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:44,767
Very happy with those arguments they are embarrassed by them

1004
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,839
And so mainstream conservatives

1005
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,911
Want to talk about self defense against

1006
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Burglars

1007
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:54,751
And mainstream liberals

1008
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,031
Want to talk

1009
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
About

1010
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,079
How

1011
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,919
The second amendment protects State organized militias

1012
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
And

1013
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,967
Almost nothing else

1014
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
Anyway getting back to the story

1015
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,343
These three libertarian lawyers they decide

1016
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,647
Put together case and their idea was to

1017
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,207
The target this really restrictive gun law

1018
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
In DC

1019
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:21,119
All handguns were banned you can own a shotgun or a rifle but the law specifically made it illegal to ever put a round in the chamber

1020
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,911
Even in self-defense or there is

1021
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:29,567
There's really Funk we we we described it as a ban on all functional Firearms but in order to challenge that law

1022
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,847
They needed to find a plaintiff

1023
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
Interesting how do you find a

1024
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
Plaintiff

1025
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,687
You look for somebody who

1026
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
Got robbed what do you do

1027
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,271
Well we can actually instigate

1028
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
Litigation

1029
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,319
We can take out a

1030
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:46,719
Full page ad in the New York Times saying you want them indicate your second amendment rights give us a ring essentially got the word out talk to

1031
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
2

1032
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,279
I would say between

1033
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
2 + 3000

1034
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
People they all had

1035
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:58,239
Really interesting stories they found a guy who was gay gentleman named Tom Palmer could previously been

1036
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,799
Assaulted when he lived in California

1037
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:01,823
Because he was gay

1038
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,383
Was almost murdered by a skinhead mahbuba phobic

1039
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,175
Subs and he wanted a gun

1040
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,199
To protect himself

1041
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:11,039
Are lead plaintiff was an African-American woman named Shelly Parker

1042
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,831
She was trying to protect yourself against

1043
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,671
Local drug dealers and the cops actually told her she should get a gun

1044
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207
Which was illegal

1045
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,863
Weird so they have this whole group so we ended up with three men and three women mid twenties to early 60s

1046
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,399
Former y2am rapper

1047
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,703
American and the problem they ran into

1048
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,775
Was that all these super sympathetic plaintiff

1049
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,103
Didn't have this very special thing they needed

1050
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
To bring a case

1051
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:42,527
Standing standing with a legal term meaning they didn't have a sufficient grievance to be in court like if you can bring a case

1052
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,343
Have to show that you've been actually harmed by

1053
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,695
Not being able to get a gun you have to show some physical concrete proof

1054
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,743
The harm has been done that you've been

1055
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
Denied a gun

1056
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,815
And none of the plaintiff had that

1057
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,959
Except for one

1058
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
Dick

1059
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
That's me

1060
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,103
Good to meet you and you

1061
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
DeKalb

1062
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
What does your dad say

1063
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,199
Sean this is my favorite hat

1064
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,735
Make America

1065
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,271
Free again

1066
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,063
Actually gets paid by The Fray

1067
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,159
With a big Western handgun in the center

1068
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:25,023
It looks like you drew a trigger out there that what you did well it was missing the trigger so

1069
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
We had to update it

1070
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
Who's we

1071
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Okay

1072
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,935
Where's the Supreme Court

1073
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:34,751
Building where he became famous he's

1074
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,823
Swim seventy five year old white guy

1075
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,151
Sports classes that look straight out of the 70s

1076
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,455
Got a situation here you want to cross

1077
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
Sure what's the situation

1078
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:51,903
The anti Trump protesters are here actually happened to meet him in DC today after Trump

1079
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,463
Trump won the election the hate Freedom apparently

1080
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,559
President-elect is visiting the White House

1081
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,095
There were protesters everywhere

1082
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
Cornet

1083
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,447
Notmypresident there anti Trump protesters

1084
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:11,103
Don't you like Freedom what about 3

1085
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Freedom

1086
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,199
What about freedom

1087
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,039
Most of the protesters that were passing us wear white but

1088
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:23,135
Just as a few young black men pacify

1089
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
He says

1090
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,975
See you on the plantation

1091
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,815
Freedom

1092
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,167
See you on the plantation

1093
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
Yeah

1094
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,727
I just say that

1095
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:41,823
We in Washington we call it the government Plantation

1096
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
You didn't mean

1097
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:47,711
You kids are about to be slaves or something cuz that's how I interpreted it

1098
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:52,831
The more power government has the less Freedom you have the closer you get the ball and chain

1099
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,623
Other Plantation

1100
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
This pretty good place to eat right there

1101
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,511
If you here for a couple of days if you been in there

1102
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,303
I have not been a pretty good

1103
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:06,911
Okay Hyatt Regency this is good for you we can do this

1104
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:11,263
We need to talk about Hyatt which is just down the street from Supreme Court and

1105
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,871
And explain to me that his journey with guns like John and Joe

1106
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,663
Began pretty casually

1107
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:19,199
Like 1976

1108
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,735
Is living in DC

1109
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
And

1110
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,295
One day he's sitting at home

1111
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
I was watching

1112
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:28,671
My hero Matt Dillon Gunsmoke

1113
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,231
Different Matt Dillon

1114
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,607
And he had this long-barreled handgun

1115
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,935
I was about 30 years old

1116
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,727
And I figured ghali

1117
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,519
I should own my first gun

1118
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,799
So when I went and bought

1119
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,615
My when I call my Matt Dillon special

1120
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,455
Hi standard 22 revolver Matt Dillon Buntline

1121
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
And it was just

1122
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,271
I live in America

1123
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,063
We're Cowboys Society

1124
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,111
I should have a cowboy gun and was just

1125
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:01,695
Nothing no really deep thought to it

1126
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:08,095
But then just a few months after he got that gun in October 1976

1127
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
Started with the Mulford Act

1128
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,423
And the Black Panthers back in Sacramento

1129
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,287
Hits Washington DC DC gun control regulations outlawed

1130
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:21,919
Firearms ownership get that gun law which outlawed all hang out so I had some choices

1131
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
I could

1132
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
Turn it into the government

1133
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,503
Not going to happen

1134
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,063
I can throw it in the Dipsy dumpster

1135
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,343
Not going to happen

1136
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,927
Or there was no other option I could go to jail

1137
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:37,023
Not going to happen eventually he decides on option D

1138
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,095
Give the gun to his brother my brother lived in Maryland

1139
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,887
So that made it very convenient

1140
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,703
Did you just go visit your gun in Maryland what did you do

1141
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,495
I yes I would go visit

1142
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,543
And caress and use my gun

1143
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
What did you use it

1144
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,359
Target practice

1145
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
Of course

1146
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
Take me to

1147
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,479
Gun visitation situation sound functional but

1148
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,319
I think like any long-distance relationship they mostly sucked because

1149
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:06,719
More and more he didn't feel safe where he lifts I lived about 10 blocks from the Capitol building right across the street

1150
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
From

1151
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,047
The number one most infamous

1152
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
Drug

1153
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
Dealer Den

1154
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,167
In the city called Kentucky courts

1155
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,215
Every night at 2 a.m.

1156
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:21,055
The chief drug dealer would fire a 9 mm

1157
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,103
Into the air empty the clip

1158
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,895
And that was the signal

1159
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
Every night at 2

1160
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,223
Drug dealing was over

1161
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
For the day

1162
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,623
It's clear that living through the crack epidemic in DC really

1163
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,927
Shaped a lot of dicks views on gun

1164
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
So

1165
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,583
In the years after the handgun ban

1166
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:49,727
Dick starts the very long process of finding a way to get his gun back to DC and he eventually then quits his desk job

1167
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,775
To pursue getting his gun back

1168
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,335
Full-time I'm all over Capitol Hill

1169
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
And I see

1170
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,663
Security guards

1171
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
Have guns

1172
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
Well

1173
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
Going

1174
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,063
Why can't I be a security guard

1175
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,343
Golly

1176
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,135
Maybe that would help me

1177
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Have a gun

1178
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,207
But I can't have on my own

1179
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:14,047
Let's see how easy or not easy this is

1180
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Dali

1181
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,887
One Step leads to another

1182
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,911
Just like that

1183
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,751
Dick was able to have a gun in DC but only during the day

1184
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,287
And only while he was working

1185
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,567
Like Barney Fife

1186
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:29,151
At the end of my shift I have to turn in my gun and my bullets

1187
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,431
And they kept it there

1188
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,967
And they kept it on sidon

1189
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,783
He finally starts looking for some help

1190
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:35,807
Some legal help

1191
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:39,391
I knew Washington cuz I lived here and I've gone to something tanks

1192
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:44,767
Cato in Heritage and some others I knew they existed and right around the time out there looking for some help

1193
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,839
Turns out these lawyers are out there looking for some dick

1194
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
No

1195
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
No

1196
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:58,079
Wasn't there ideal sympathetic guy I was told repeatedly and it was in print that I was the worst

1197
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,871
Choice less-than-optimal

1198
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,431
You know because of that Plantation thing you said or

1199
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,527
He was always talk smack about the federal government and interviews

1200
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
One day

1201
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
Clark neily

1202
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,623
Put a note in my hand and said dick Heller

1203
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
This is what you say

1204
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,951
I just wanted a gun

1205
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,743
Protect my house

1206
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,767
Shut up

1207
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,839
Play it wasn't their favorite princess

1208
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,911
But the one thing that no one else has done

1209
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,959
Which is besides just wanting

1210
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:29,055
An illegal handgun in DC he actually fill out an application

1211
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,895
To register a gun that he already possessed again in Virginia

1212
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:36,735
And had that application denied and he had this denial slip or whatever

1213
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,295
Call me like literally had this physical proof

1214
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,343
All of his grievance

1215
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,207
And simple technical arbitrary little stupid piece of paper gave him

1216
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,767
What's known as standing to bring the case

1217
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:53,887
Dick Heller ended up being on the last man standing there was nothing to do but that was not our choice regardless

1218
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,703
And I became their guy and these three lawyers

1219
00:52:56,959 --> 00:53:00,799
They take the case of the DC court and the judge after

1220
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,335
Inspecting it said

1221
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,871
The case can go forward

1222
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,431
Magic Moment

1223
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,535
This Magic Moment

1224
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:25,631
The Supreme Court is entering the debate over the Second Amendment right to bear arms

1225
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:31,775
Today's cases roster huge interest among citizens and politicians alike and it is divided even the president

1226
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,055
And vice president

1227
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
Chapter 3

1228
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:36,895
The record

1229
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
March 18th

1230
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,711
2008

1231
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,271
The day the Heller case was argue that the

1232
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:46,623
In court everyone understood how high the stakes were

1233
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:53,279
Outside in front of the Supreme Court protesters by the hundreds were marching and

1234
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Panting

1235
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,423
Favor of gun rights and in favor of gun control

1236
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
Journalist

1237
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:06,079
From all over the world to send it upon the supreme court that day

1238
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,639
An inside the Supreme Court House

1239
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,687
Not a creature was stirring not even a mouse

1240
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,503
You could have heard a mouse I say

1241
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
And

1242
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,087
Everybody is just quiet

1243
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,903
And you can hear your heart beating

1244
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
And suddenly

1245
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,975
Bam

1246
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,559
And then Oye Oye Oye

1247
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
The clerk yelled at the top of his lungs

1248
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,679
And then there's a strange sound

1249
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,983
What can that be

1250
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,775
It was the swishing

1251
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:39,871
Of the Robes of the justices as they ascended the steps

1252
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,639
To the bench

1253
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,455
Unbelievable

1254
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:49,855
We will hear argument today in case 07 to 90 District of Columbia vs. Heller

1255
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:54,719
This is the first time in our history the Supreme Court with directly try to figure out what the Second Amendment mean

1256
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,255
Richard ehlinger

1257
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,839
Good morning mr. chief justice and may please

1258
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:02,911
Walter Dellinger gets up

1259
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,983
And jumps right into it

1260
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,543
Essential question like

1261
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,871
What was James Madison thinking when he wrote the super confusing sentence

1262
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:13,407
Was he

1263
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:18,527
Thinking about the individual people and their right to own a gun or was he thinking about the collective right

1264
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,831
Of the militia to own a gun

1265
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,135
In the first text to consider

1266
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:25,951
Is the phrase protecting a right to

1267
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:27,999
Keep and bear arms

1268
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:31,327
If you look at the phrase the phrase keep and bear arms

1269
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
Hot was used at the time

1270
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,423
Every person to use the phrase bear arms

1271
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
Used to refer to the use of arms

1272
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
In connection

1273
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:45,663
Whitman service

1274
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,479
When he says people have a right to bear arms

1275
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,015
All he really means is

1276
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:53,343
Report for Duty

1277
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:58,207
Keeping and bearing arms when do you list the Amendments first Clause confirmed

1278
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:04,863
That's a right

1279
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:12,799
Keep arms just the people in the state militias why wouldn't they say

1280
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,847
State militias have the right to keep arms

1281
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,919
Listen to Justice I believe that the phrase

1282
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
The people

1283
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,735
And the phrase the militia

1284
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,783
We're really in sync with each other

1285
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,575
The Federalist farmer uses

1286
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,343
The phrase

1287
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,135
The people are the militia

1288
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:32,255
Cut against you if the militia included all the people

1289
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,535
Includes all the people

1290
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,327
Yes I do believe in include

1291
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:41,471
At this point everyone start interrupting each other

1292
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,543
Metallica scrum and they're all trying to figure out

1293
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,687
Okay so when Madison what the phrase

00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:52,223
Thinking of the people

1295
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:58,367
What those words meant with the people just the militia or everyone all the people

1296
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:03,487
What is the relationship between the second part of the sentence the people part and the first part of the sentence

1297
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:07,839
The militia part Verdugo rokita

According to Adam Winkler

1304
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:25,759
Was

1305
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,039
For liberals

1306
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:27,807
Stevens

Souter retire Ginsburg

1308
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,671
Seem to want to emphasize the militia part of the sentence

1309
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,743
Avenue had the 4 conservative justices Scalia

1310
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:39,839
Thomas Alito Roberts 15 to 1 emphasize the people part of the sentence

1311
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:43,679
The second part I don't see how there's any any any

1312
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:47,519
Contradiction team captain quarterback

1313
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,567
The first chair that day was

1314
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:52,383
Without a doubt Justice Antonin

1315
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,431
Scalia why isn't

1316
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
Perfectly

1317
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,223
Plausible

1318
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
Indeed

1319
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:01,087
To assume that since the framers knew that the

1320
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367
Destroyed by tyrants

1321
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,767
Justice Scalia

1322
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,791
Of course was

1323
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:12,607
Very conservative Justice grew up in Queens

1324
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:19,007
This is Joan biskupic longtime reporter covering the Supreme Court has also written a biography of Justice Scalia

1325
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,567
Avid Hunter and he grew up in a time when

1326
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:27,711
Young men were trained in firearms in high school auction

1327
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:33,087
Even from the time he was a kid at school and queens he said he used to carry his gun

1328
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,623
For rifle practice

1329
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
School

1330
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,183
On the Subways of New York

1331
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,255
Can you imagine doing that today in New York City

1332
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,559
You're being unrealistic

1333
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,631
The second clause is not broader than the

1334
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:47,679
The principal purpose

1335
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,983
Second floor

1336
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,055
Just the right of the people

1337
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,103
To keep and bear arms

1338
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
It's going to be

1339
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:03,551
What year throughout the arguments is that Scalia is very very forward Lee pressing

1340
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,343
This word of individual rights

1341
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,879
Argan speaks

1342
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,927
And just like David souter

1343
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,231
Are arguing back saying

1344
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,023
What are the collected the militia

1345
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:19,935
This goes on for well over an hour the justices grilling lawyers arguing amongst themselves

1346
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:22,751
Everybody trying to figure out what was in James Madison's head

1347
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,311
Until finally

1348
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,335
Justice Breyer

1349
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:29,151
One of the liberal just waited like you're saying

1350
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:31,455
Is unreasonable the phone

1351
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,503
Forget what Madison intended

1352
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:35,551
There is no way for us to know

1353
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,831
Let's talk about now

1354
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,367
Talk about gun violence

1355
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,903
This sentence was most

1356
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,951
Definitely written about muskets

1357
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,511
What about handguns and assault rifles

1358
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,303
What is reasonable

1359
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,375
Now 82 a hundred thousand people

1360
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,143
Every year

1361
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
Where in the United

1362
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:51,679
State

1363
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
Or either killed

1364
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
In

1365
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,287
Gun-related

1366
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,311
Homicide

1367
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,103
Crimes

1368
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,639
4 Act

1369
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
Or suicide suicide

1370
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,247
That's why I say 81

1371
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,063
Now in light of that

1372
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:09,855
Why

1373
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,903
Isn't a ban on handguns

1374
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
Reasonable

1375
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,231
Or April

1376
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:15,999
Fortunate

1377
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
On behalf

1378
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,399
Because you are

1379
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,447
The same reason I was offered by

1380
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,239
Numerous Military Officers

1381
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,263
At the highest levels

1382
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,567
Of the US military all branches

1383
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,335
Service

1384
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,615
Writing to briefs

1385
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,687
They they agree with us at the handgun ban

1386
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
Search the week in America's military

1387
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,039
Preparedness because basically argues

1388
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,831
When you take away people's guns

1389
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,367
They're going to be less prepared

1390
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,927
If and when they enlist in the army

1391
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
To which Jessie

1392
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
Spires like

1393
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,023
They can still practice shooting

1394
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,327
Rifles banned in DC

1395
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,631
They can go to gun ranges I guess in neighboring

1396
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,007
What does that make it unreasonable for a city

1397
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,823
With a very high crime rate

1398
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,871
Assuming

1399
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,967
Objective is what the military people say to keep us ready for the draft

1400
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
If necessary

1401
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,527
Is it unreasonable

1402
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,575
People first city without high crime rate

1403
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,623
Just say no

1404
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
Handgun

1405
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,415
Here

1406
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:23,071
Well you want to say yes that is correct but I want to hear what

1407
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,423
Because it is a big crime problem I'm simply getting you to focus

1408
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,519
Stop by the way it was Justice Scalia telling Alan gura

1409
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,567
How to answer just as Breyers

1410
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,103
Question

1411
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Is Justice Scalia

1412
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,991
And actually feels any standard of review that might be offered under Section

1413
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:41,759
Construction

1414
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:48,415
The oral arguments last 97 minutes

1415
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:52,767
Far longer than most other cases and going into the arguments many

1416
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,047
Supreme Court Watchers

1417
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,119
Figured the case would be a close 5-4 decision

1418
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,911
And it could go either way

1419
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,447
And as with

1420
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,495
All of these clothes cases

1421
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,311
Question was what would Anthony Kennedy the swing just

1422
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
Do

1423
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,407
As in so many issues in America

1424
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,223
Comes down to what does Anthony Kennedy believe

1425
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:18,623
So at the oral argument and I had the Good Fortune to be at the oral argument in the Heller case

1426
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,671
Everyone was looking

1427
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:23,231
Here what would he say about the Second Amendment

1428
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,511
His was really devoted

1429
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:27,327
Accountant and the very first comment he made

1430
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,679
They are concerned

1431
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,055
Himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes

1432
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:40,127
Wolves bears and grizzly something like that

1433
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:44,223
One of the first things he said was about bears

1434
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,527
Like not bear arms but

1435
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
Grizzly bear

1436
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,623
The point County was trying to make with clear

1437
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:55,743
Don't you think the framers had other reasons that they wanted people to have guns

1438
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,791
Other than just being in a militia

1439
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,607
What about people being in their homes

1440
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,399
And is meeting to defend themselves

1441
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:08,799
And that's when I silently screamed at the top of my lungs so nobody could hear me yes

1442
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,079
Sweet

1443
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,871
...

1444
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
Something

1445
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,767
We were turned out to be historic

1446
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:35,167
Supreme Court decision handed down this morning

1447
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,703
Columbia versus Heller

1448
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:44,383
We hold that the second amendment guarantees an individual rights

1449
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:49,247
And that the district's handgun ban as well as its requirement that firearms in the home

1450
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,527
Be rendered inoperative

1451
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:51,551
Violate

1452
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:52,831
It was

1453
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:56,159
A groundbreaking reading of the Second Amendment

1454
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,767
Scalia minimize

1455
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:07,167
Steck was referring to a well regulated militia and put the stress on the second Clause that refer to the right

1456
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,983
Right of the people the people will not be deprived of the right

1457
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
Keep and bear arms

1458
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,823
This was as good as it got for him on the bed

1459
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,103
I think so

1460
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,407
Rip the militia clause

1461
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,455
December 15 1791

1462
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,759
The June 26 2008

1463
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,063
A pretty good run if I'm being honest

1464
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,415
For the first time in the history of these United States

1465
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:32,511
The courts definitively declared that the second amendment gives

1466
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,791
Every American

1467
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,839
The right to a gun for self-defense

1468
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:41,727
It was a it was a great day for freedom in America was a great day for the Constitution great day for citizens

1469
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,799
The great day for gun owners it was great day for

1470
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,079
Fearful people

1471
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
Of course

1472
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:51,455
Not everyone agreed I mean to me that's a travesty

1473
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,271
This is Jack Rico

1474
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:59,647
Professor of history and political science at Stanford University for the court and

1475
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:02,463
The history is just

1476
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,231
Wrong

1477
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:07,583
The Second Amendment is not about individual right argue that we shouldn't even be talking

1478
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
About his

1479
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:12,959
Because Rachel Firearms has changed so radically for the 18th century to our own time

1480
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,239
And ultimately

1481
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:19,615
And hear your Echo Justice Stevens in his descent

1482
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:22,175
And what political Thicket

1483
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
To be honest I mean

1484
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:27,295
I don't really believe in constitutional law anymore

1485
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,855
I think I socialize affection

1486
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,671
Pianos become so highly politicized

1487
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,463
In so many areas

1488
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
I think I socialize

1489
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
Is bunk

1490
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:43,679
Wow I just destroyed I'm not a lawyer so that I don't have any professional steak and defending the Judiciary

1491
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:46,751
What

1492
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
There's a very

1493
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,543
Big

1494
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:53,663
But he did have a major caveat the next section of our opinion points out that like most rights

1495
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,943
The Second Amendment right is

1496
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,759
He said like all right

1497
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:03,647
It's not absolutely it is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever

1498
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,415
And for whatever

1499
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,951
Which is very important

1500
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,999
To keep in mind

1501
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,023
Cast doubt

1502
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,351
Possession of firearm

1503
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,399
You

1504
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,167
Or lost

1505
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,191
Forbidding the carrying of

1506
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:16,959
The firearms

1507
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,239
Sensitive places touch

1508
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,335
This is another thing that we tend to forget

1509
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,663
The decision says every individual has the right to bear arms

1510
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:28,479
The most interesting lie like the decision also says

1511
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
Of course

1512
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,039
We need gun control

1513
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,087
Edward Heller

1514
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,879
Come to represent

1515
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:35,647
Like

1516
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,439
2nd Amendment rights

1517
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,487
Are you for or against Hillary

1518
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,511
Even though

1519
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,791
Being for Heller

1520
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,583
Is being for Duncan

1521
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,143
Fusing yeah it is

1522
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,191
After all this time

1523
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:48,959
Still just

1524
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,495
Totally confusing

1525
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,543
You have a right to a gun

1526
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,335
But the government has a right to regulate

1527
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,151
Decal gets his gun back in DC

1528
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:01,247
But DC still also has all sorts of gun regulations

1529
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,343
You see the same pattern all over the country some states are lenient

1530
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,623
Summer super strict

1531
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:10,207
And both approaches seem to comply with Heller

1532
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,023
In a way the Heller Decision

1533
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,303
Is just like all those

1534
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,887
Commas and Clauses that we started with in James Madison sentence

1535
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
It's this

1536
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,471
Confusing declaration

1537
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,287
That leaves the door wide open for interpretation

1538
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
Which

1539
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,407
Obviously sucks

1540
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,951
We could use

1541
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,975
A little more

1542
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,511
Clarity on

1543
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,559
How to live with this

1544
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,863
Second Amendment right to bear arms

1545
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
Open

1546
01:07:56,287 --> 01:08:02,431
It gives us an opportunity I think

1547
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:08,831
Opportunity to get it right to fix it

1548
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:15,231
Nothing but now be pretty good time

1549
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,663
