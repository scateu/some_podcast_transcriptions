Isabel perfect Amgen iPhone ride

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:15,872
This season we are bringing u27

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:22,272
The most perfect album

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
Together a series of songs

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:30,976
Buy a whole bunch of different musicians inspired by the amendments to the US Constitution

7
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,144
Thus far we have done one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 13 14 15

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,240
Today we're going to keep going nonlinear we're going to LeapFrog ahead but also double back

9
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,544
When your liner notes first than the songs

10
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,080
These two amendments

11
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:46,848
Alright enough

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,920
Are of a very particular breed

13
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,784
You know in the taxonomy of the 27 amendments there are the ones that are the sort of the big ones

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
Soaring

15
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,600
Principled

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
Freedom of speech

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,184
You know those kind of minutes and then

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
You have the one key

19
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,560
The procedure ones that are almost like

20
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,864
Engineering drawings

21
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:13,472
Like okay we've got this house it needs a structural fix so here's how you do it

22
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,520
But this thing against this thing you bought this

23
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Do that

24
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,080
Maybe it'll work

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
They're very kind of practical

26
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,200
Actually find those kind of measurements to be the most inter

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
Today we have two of those starting with

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,576
16th Amendment

29
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
Income tax

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
The sixteenth amendment is

31
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,976
Probably not

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
One of the ones that

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
Do you know off the top of your head

34
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,864
More perfect producer sarkari

35
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
But

36
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
If you live in the United States and you're bringing home a paycheck

37
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,104
It's definitely a part of your life

38
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,200
Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes

39
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
From whatever Source derived

40
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,296
Without apportionment among the several States

41
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,368
Without regard to any census or enumeration

42
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,976
You probably also know that

43
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
I don't like the IRS

44
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,536
What what don't you like

45
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
They take our money

46
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,656
Is basically American tradition to complain about paying taxes

47
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,192
We spend at least six

48
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,984
Billion man hour

49
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,592
Dealing with taxes in the United States Senate 2016 polls showed that

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,408
Vladimir Putin and OJ Simpson

51
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,968
Are more popular than the IRS

52
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,832
Rooms at Chipotle

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
So we left

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
Complain about taxes

55
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,464
Jet

56
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
And here's the puzzle

57
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,560
If you look at the rate at which

58
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
Which we pay them

59
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,936
The United States has a really high rate of compliance compared to other countries

60
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:53,312
Somewhere between 80 and 85% of all taxes at the IRS estimate should have been paid

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
Are actually paid by individuals and corporations

62
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,736
That's James armchair the department of Economics Tulane University

63
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
And before him Jim Hines

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,368
Professor of economics and professor of law at the University of Michigan

65
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
What they're both talking about is sometimes called

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
The compliance rate

67
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
How good

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
Are we at paying the taxes that were supposed to pay

69
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
End America

70
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
Scores

71
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,264
Unusually well or good about five out of every $6 of taxes at the IRS believes

72
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
Should be paid in taxes are actually paid and tax

73
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
And both of them told me that

74
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,248
This crazy high number has puzzled Economist for a really long time

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,832
It just shouldn't be as high as it is

76
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,392
Just to put this in perspective

77
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,720
In recent years the United States has ranked

78
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,792
7th in the world when it comes to literacy rates

79
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
21st

80
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,888
When it comes to the strength of our democracy

81
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,424
And 31st

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
When it comes to life

83
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
Pregnancy

84
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
But somehow the most International surveys the United States is among the top three countries in the world

85
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
Compliance rate with

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,712
Access

87
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,992
An economist

88
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,016
Don't know how to

89
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:06,784
Explain this

90
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
They literally call it attacks

91
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
Compliance puzzle

92
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
Anna puzzle gifts

93
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,744
Even deeper if you look at the number of people that the IRS

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
Actually goes after

95
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Stair every year

96
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
What percentage of people do you think

97
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,399
The IRS audits

98
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
15

99
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,263
30

100
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
52

101
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
60%

102
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,919
About 60% maybe maybe 70%

103
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Sun

104
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,759
Hook weather alert

105
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
That's awesome

106
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
Buy likes

107
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,599
69.5%

108
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,927
What if I told you that that number is actually

109
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
Half of a percent

110
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
Damn

111
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,559
Wow

112
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
I mean

113
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,167
I just thought it would be

114
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
Be a lot higher

115
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
For the last several decades

116
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
The IRS is auditing

117
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,271
Has been steadily going down the overall audit rate was

118
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
More than 5%

119
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,647
Pirs blades big cut since 2010 the agency's budget has

120
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,999
Shrunk by a billion dollars it also has

121
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,815
17000 fewer employees

122
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,679
So really all signs are pointing towards rationally speaking know what your panties are

123
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,959
Your chance of getting caught

124
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,495
So

125
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
You should

126
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
You should pay zero

127
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,199
That's Vanessa Williamson fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution

128
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
That's not what

129
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
People do

130
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
And the question is

131
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Why

132
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
Why do people pee

133
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,111
No it's going to side

134
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,695
For a second the fact that a lot of taxes get taken out by employers

135
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,791
There's still a lot of cases where people have to voluntarily to

136
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
Declare their income and they do it and why

137
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
Why do they do it when the chances of getting

138
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
Caught ziehm solo

139
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,471
One answered

140
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Could be that

141
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
They don't know that

142
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,823
The chances are so low and they're scared

143
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
Because the IRS works

144
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
It's really hard to make them sick

145
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
They use

146
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
The media

147
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Frankly is

148
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,575
Part of their device for effective

149
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Tax enforcement

150
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:24,511
Their message that they want to transmit to people is if you don't comply properly

151
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
We're going to make you real sorry about it

152
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:32,959
They try to get that message across in a lot of different ways there are high-profile prosecution's

153
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,359
Sanford was found guilty and

154
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,759
Will report to federal prison in Connecticut on Monday Wesley Snipes

155
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,159
Passenger 57

156
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,047
But I'm sure it was not lost on the IRS that if you have a famous actor go to prison that will help

157
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,095
You know I get people's attention

158
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,631
Leona Helmsley

159
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,983
The self-appointed hotel Queen Somebody from irr you know very wealthy

160
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,335
Call socialite in New York married to Harry Helmsley who owned a lot of fancy hotels

161
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,151
She was known in the Press has the Queen of Mean

162
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
I mean it was

163
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
The perfect villainess

164
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
For the IRS

165
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,551
The helmsley's were indicted for not paying their taxes

166
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
Mo Harry did not have to face charges because of his health

167
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
Leona did

168
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,439
I am not going to

169
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,535
DJ alive done nothing wrong they had her arrested on

170
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
April 14th

171
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,095
In an era when

172
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:36,703
Half the country did their taxes on the evening of April 14th oh my God

173
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
So

174
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
So fear like

175
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,407
Carefully cultivated fear might be one piece of the answer here

176
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
It doesn't seem to me

177
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
To be the whole story

178
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
You waiting for somebody to play chess with

179
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
Because when I went out to talk to

180
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
Two people I heard a few but he man stories for sure

181
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:05,119
But mainly what I heard was that people felt like the taxes that they were paying

182
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
We're going towards

183
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,191
Something

184
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,031
Everybody had that one thing in their mind that they were thinking of

185
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
I mean

186
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,895
Federal welfare programs like food stamps

187
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:24,319
Housing programs and excetera

188
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
Starzer everything another part of tax compliance is what called tax morale

189
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:37,119
And that's wrapped up in our sense our Civic sense that paying taxes is the right thing to do every year the IRA

190
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:43,519
IRS commissions a study essentially asking people why why do they pay

191
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,919
And last year 95% of those people said it's every American civic duty

192
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
Bipartisan view paying taxes is the cost of citizenship

193
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
As well as American democracy itself

194
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:15,519
They talk to you about politics right they talk to you about contributing to the people they see is us

195
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:21,919
Taxes is only right

196
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,319
What's this really not very fair to anybody else who is

197
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:34,719
Part of the community and therefore deserve to be represented doesn't work if you know

198
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
Put a little something and it's got a little something out pay your taxes

199
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:47,519
And the ex post you know hundred years later on the 16th Amendment has got to be pretty favorable

200
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
I mean

201
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,103
Try to imagine our world

202
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Without income

203
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,479
The kind of government that you would have is not the kind of government you have right now

204
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,183
Sarkari with a lighter note for the 16th Amendment

205
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
The song on the album

206
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,863
Comes from a Chicago Illinois band called post animal.

207
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:10,463
If you want to hear the rest of this song the rest of any of the songs on the album go to

Gain the most perfect album. Org

213
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
I'm Jenna from Rob this more perfect season 3

Continue with one more men after

215
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
Is more perfect

216
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:36,319
Most perfect album season 3 on Jad appenrod we just heard a song from post animal before that liner notes for these

217
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,111
16th Amendment going to jump

218
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
Forward now six spots

219
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,695
Two number 22

220
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
Another seemingly wonky one but actually kind of cool Kelly Prime

221
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,583
Brings us the liner notes for this one

222
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
The 22nd Amendment

223
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
Isn't a big one

224
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
Honestly

225
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Not even a medium one

226
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:58,079
After we got our right to speech our right to bear arms

227
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
Actually abolish slavery to find citizenship and made sure men women and people of color all got there

228
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Right to vote

229
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,855
Kind of feels like a loan Falls over the Constitution

230
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Right

231
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:19,071
Ron

232
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:25,727
In 2018 suddenly this unassuming little amendment number 22

233
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,263
Just getting really

234
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
Interesting

235
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,223
The most dramatic political change in China in decade and it all started back in February

236
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,759
With news from China

237
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:44,159
China's ruling Communist Party proposed Sunday to remove term limits on the office of President giving prices

238
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:50,559
The right to remain in office indefinitely in office indefinitely

239
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
3000 delegates

240
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,655
Being told the Amendments when needed

241
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
Because the challenges China faces

242
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
Require a strong leader

243
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
And the United party

244
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,895
So China has had a two-term limit on the office of president for over three decades

245
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,711
And this year under President Xi Jinping

246
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
Describe

247
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
Not long after

248
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
Trump responded

249
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
Kitchen is grey

250
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Gentleman

251
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
He's now president for life

252
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,007
He suggested it was something we should consider

253
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,335
This is Gillian Metzger professor of law

254
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
Columbia Law School

255
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:41,503
I remember people freaked out like it was one of those I mean for a day they are too but you know there was another remember the 22nd

256
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
XXII

257
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
Two term limit on president

258
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,695
No person shall be elected to the Office of the President more than twice

259
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,231
And no person who

260
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,071
And then they remember the 22nd

261
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
Yeah well I think what WhatsApp

262
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,423
22nd Amendment says no

263
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
No president for life

264
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
2 *

265
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
8 years

266
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:04,799
Max I wonder if you can tell me

267
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
How long have we had the 20s

268
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,431
What words have the 22nd amendment send

269
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
1951

270
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,551
So that means that the two term limit is actually younger than Donald Trump

271
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,903
I think that's right

272
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,255
We didn't have any term limits on the presidency for 163 years

273
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
For most of us history we didn't eat it

274
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,887
The right now a wind is blowing in America

275
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
McKinley win

276
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,263
I'm coming in on that wind are a lot of basic questions about

277
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
What kind of country we want to have

278
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,383
Let me tell you about two other times

279
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
When that same wind has blown

280
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,503
Let's go back

281
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
The beginning

282
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,135
Was it a time when America was choosing its very first president

283
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:58,047
George motherfuckin Washington

284
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
10 president

285
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,655
Was arguably the most famous person in the western world

286
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,007
This is denver brunsman

287
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Peking university

288
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,103
We do have to keep in mind that the motto of the executive

289
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
What's the time

290
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
Was

291
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,407
The monarchy

292
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:22,111
This was right after the revolution we had just won a war against Britain for Independence

293
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
But

294
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,951
Is clear the weather we didn't want it was

295
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,279
Pretty unclear what exactly are presidency should look like

296
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,863
Up to that point I mean going all the way back to ancient times

297
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
Young people like Caesar

298
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,447
Oliver Cromwell

299
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
Oh there was a pattern of

300
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:40,287
Strongman Leading Armies

301
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Victory

302
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
And then staying

303
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Hang on

304
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
So that was a basic Playbook

305
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,223
In walks

306
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
BDubs

307
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
He was about six two and a half

308
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,879
Tall athletic

309
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,927
In his younger years he was handsome

310
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,511
High cheekbones auburn hair

311
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
That today we might almost call

312
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Aloof

313
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,119
People admired

314
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,143
4

315
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
Bing someone above

316
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Others

317
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
In other words this guy walked

318
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,519
Tok and glowed

319
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,871
Like a king and Americans kind of default started treating him like one

320
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:23,039
Are the guys at the Constitutional Convention they gave him the power of the veto the power to declare war the power to pardon

321
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Intermittent

322
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,391
No way if anything I think there was

323
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,159
Is more of a saint

324
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,183
As Hamilton

325
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Target at the

326
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:30,975
Convention

327
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
That that should be

328
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
A lifetime

329
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Office

330
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
Soap George Washington get elected

331
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
Keyspan

332
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,191
1 year 2 years

333
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,263
4 years suddenly 8 years in office

334
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,871
A lot of people thought that he would just keep serving till he died

335
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,711
Play George Washington kind of struggled with that question

336
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:59,135
Click on the one hand America is a democracy and in a democracy we go with what we the people want

337
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,951
Seemingly what we the people wanted was

338
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,975
For him to stay on

339
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,815
On the other hand he's just one guy

340
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
What's laws

341
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Yasso Washington

342
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
Resisted

343
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,239
The office the king in different ways and

344
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Wrote a great letter

345
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
To an English historian

346
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
A woman named

347
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Catherine Macaulay Graham

348
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,223
And Washington remark to her that I walk on untrodden ground

349
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
Basically that everything I do

350
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Is oppressive

351
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,599
Should I stay

352
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:30,879
Pusha T go

353
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:37,535
Garrison said however he answered that question it was going to reverberate forward in time

354
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:44,447
And so in the wee hours of the morn

355
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,847
September 19th 1796 George Washington

356
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:57,247
Pushes his Farewell Address newspaper any road back to Mount Vernon

357
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:03,647
Back to Virginia to Mount Vernon and and saying

358
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:10,047
People picking up the newspaper that day and appears to me proper especially as it make induced two or more distinct expression

359
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447
Of the public voice that I should now appraise you of the resolution I have formed to decline being considered among the number

360
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
Of those out of whom a choice is to be made

361
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
Going just one newspaper had the Farewell Address is called the American Daily Advertiser but very soon I got reprinted

362
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
And many other newspapers is hard to overstate how surprising this would be because

363
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:42,047
All of Western history it almost never happened before that someone willingly gave up their power

364
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:48,447
Washington medaille 3 years later

365
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:54,847
Answer the message I think would have been clear that this was potentially in office for life

366
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:02,527
The way I like to imagine it is it by stepping down George Washington

367
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,855
Just barely avoids getting swept away in this

368
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
Kaley wind that have been blowing through the country

369
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,255
And with that one action he forced all the Fate

370
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,351
The state suspended above us 436 years

371
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
Until

372
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
Was there a president like

373
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,543
President in particular that change.

374
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,735
It's 1932 nation is in Desperate economic shape

375
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
Black Tuesday

376
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Market crash

377
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
It's the Great Depression

378
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Jobs savings

379
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:53,727
Thousands and thousands of banks started failing Farmers went bankrupt Americans were literally starving

380
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
But then

381
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,175
Franklin Delano Roosevelt rolled in

382
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,711
And he instantly

383
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
Takes charge

384
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:11,135
He had an incredible command over the media

385
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
Fireside Chats

386
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
Ladies and gentlemen

387
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
The president of the United States

388
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
We didn't have television

389
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
My friend

390
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,607
I want to talk

391
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
For a few minutes

392
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
When the people of the United States about blank

393
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:29,823
But he had this incredible ability to communicate directly with the American people through the radio

394
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,407
I want to tell you what has been done in the last few days

395
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
And why it was done

396
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,479
And what the next

397
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
SEPTA going to be

398
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:43,135
By speaking directly to the nation during its darkest time

399
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,207
We were strong enough to get out of the

400
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Depression

401
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,767
He calmed our fears

402
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Exchange

403
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,143
Congress the American people

404
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
Give him unprecedented power

405
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,823
He transformed the federal government took control of the economy

406
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,639
Establish huge new social welfare programs

407
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:09,247
And Americans elected FDR for four consecutive terms as president

408
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
And then

409
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:15,391
In 1945 in the middle of his fourth term

410
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
He dies

411
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,256
And you could say at this point

412
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
The country wakes up from

413
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,352
A collective dream

414
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,400
The depression is largely past

415
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,728
We've weathered Pearl Harbor most of World War II

416
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
And suddenly we're at war with ourselves

417
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,568
Fighting about

418
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,128
How much power a president should have

419
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,920
Wartime is one thing but

420
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
Forgodsake

421
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,968
Let's return to the

422
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
Conventional

423
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
Let's make it a constitutional

424
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,856
22nd

425
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,696
No person shall be elected to the Office of the President more than twice

426
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,000
And no person who has held the office

427
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,048
The president or acted as president

428
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:58,400
For more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president

429
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,728
Shall be elected to the office of President more than once

430
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,032
That means two terms

431
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:07,360
You're out right right exactly on one hand it does seem kind of

432
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,432
Undemocratic to me in some ways that the American people

433
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
Continue to say

434
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
Yes we want that person

435
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,832
And there's an election every four years we respect the result of

436
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,648
It seems a little bit undemocratic to me that we

437
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
Would be limited as

438
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
As American people

439
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
I think you're right

440
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
Text Julie Metzger again

441
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,864
Present only stays on repeatedly depression is Real ACT

442
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
So

443
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:34,752
I think there is a strong Democratic argument of

444
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,824
Presidents whose able to get reelected in able to

445
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,128
Generate popular support

446
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,480
The Democratic answer would be to let the people elect the president

447
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:48,064
On the other hand Gillian says the presence of these days is soap

448
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,880
Powerful that once the president gets an office

449
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
They can bully at the competition they have access to all these resources a giant megaphone I think we have to

450
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,888
Acknowledge that there are a lot of factors that those limit

451
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
The extent to which

452
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,984
The result of our presidential elections are reflections

453
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,776
Of popular will

454
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,336
Pure and simple the 22nd Amendment

455
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
Might be undemocratic it does Tire hands

456
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,200
At the same time

457
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
Maybe that's a good thing

458
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
I mean take

459
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,064
As an analogy the story of

460
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,368
Ulysses

461
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,376
Inewstore Ulysses and his men have to sail past the sirens in

462
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,704
Byron Stingily beautiful songs that lure Sailors to their death

463
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:43,360
So Ulysses knows he's not going to be able to resist the song so he tells of men

464
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:49,760
I'm not going to be able to resist just tie me up

465
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:56,160
And then we'll go past the sign cuz I can't trust myself in the moment to make the right decision

466
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
Perhaps the 22nd Amendment

467
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
Is a little like that rope

468
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:08,192
The Ulysses uses to bind his hands so he doesn't waver

469
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
If it's a profit locked

470
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:15,104
There will be times when it will cost us

471
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,896
A good present we might want to keep

472
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:22,528
But it's a prophylactic measure to not let ourselves really entertaining those thoughts

473
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
I'm go down that road

474
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:35,584
It's one small way we've chosen to protect ourselves from that Sirens song Those kingly win

475
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
President

476
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:45,312
But sometimes blow

477
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,296
That was pretty sirkeli Prime

478
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
With liner notes

479
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,136
For the 22nd Amendment

480
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:04,768
And on the album covering the 22nd is in a Brooklyn band called

481
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,048
Pavo Pavo

482
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,584
They wrote a sort of

483
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,632
Crooning Indie pop ballad

484
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,960
From the perspective of a departing president

485
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,240
