Houses Amendment

Came to be

22
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
What they mean to us now

23
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,176
We're marching right along we are getting close to the end

24
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:50,944
Today we have

25
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,968
2 amendments

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,248
2

27
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,040
Allergan start with

28
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,064
25th Amendment

29
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,720
If you've been paying attention to the news recently you know that the 25th Amendment

30
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
Has been having a moment

31
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Officials have considered attempts to remove him from office

32
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,728
Fifth amendment number

33
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:19,104
To vote out President Trump to remove him is totally irrelevant to what's going on

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
This is the Amendment that deals with

35
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,920
How do you remove a

36
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,456
Sitting president from office

37
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,504
Who may not be fit to serve

38
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,136
Section 4 whenever the vice president and the majority of either the principal officers of the executive

39
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,720
Or of such other body as Congress May by law provide

40
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
Transmit

41
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
To the president pro tempore of the

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
Send it

43
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,120
And the Speaker of the House of Representatives there written declaration

44
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Can the president

45
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
Is unable to do

46
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
Discharge the powers

47
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,216
It goes on

48
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,008
I bet I mean it really says if you don't

49
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
Pick the president up to

50
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056
Snuff here's how you

51
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
Here's how you get them

52
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,384
It's very contentious and very hotly debated thing

53
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,224
We're not going to talk about the current Administration

54
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
We can actually go back

55
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
To a Time

56
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Way before the 20th

57
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,440
5th Amendment when the whole question of

58
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
Succession

59
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
Far less

60
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
And we're going to tell the story of

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
Another Administration

62
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Hello

63
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
Hi William

64
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
Yes High

65
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
How are you

66
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008
I'm doing great

67
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
It is an amazing story

68
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,128
And it came out of a conversation that producer Tracy hunt

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,408
Had with

70
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,200
A writer and author William hazelgrove

71
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,272
Okay William so

72
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
Used Wilson

73
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
Why do we start with

74
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,488
Who are you what's your name what's your job

75
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,304
You know my name is William hazelgrove

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
Written 15 bucks

77
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Manifest

78
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
Like number 12

79
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:54,336
How did you become interested in this since you know I've been working and you know fiction and then other kind of town

80
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
Actually I was reading Scott Burns biography on Wilson and had a really interesting line where he said we'll see

81
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
She was almost the president

82
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,808
Almost a president

83
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
Wilson by the way is Woodrow Wilson

84
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,952
20th president United States 1913 to 1921

85
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
Is she being referred to here

86
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
Is his wife Edith

87
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
And I thought

88
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Almost a president

89
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,680
So I started a little research and what I found out was that

90
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
He was totally incapacitated

91
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,776
From a stroke in 1990

92
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
And that she has second wife only 42 years old

93
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Took over and

94
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688
Absolutely was the first woman president

95
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
So why don't we start with just like some kind of biographic

96
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,112
You know how did they meet okay okay

97
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:41,952
Okay so what do I

98
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
Skinny depressed is first wife

99
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
He switches his

100
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,144
Kidney disease a lot of women died of at that time

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,496
This is 1915 by the way and his first wife is only 54 when she died

102
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:02,176
And I actually want to resign the presidency

103
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,784
And Doctor Grayson who was his personal physician said me and let's go for a drive

104
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
He just wanted to get him out of the White House

105
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
To driving along

106
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
And

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,375
Edith Wilson is rather is Galt is walking along the road

108
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
They drive

109
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,775
Woodrow Wilson turned around and said

110
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
Who's that beautiful woman

111
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,527
See who is Edith Galt

112
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,367
Well she was born in Wytheville Virginia

113
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,255
1872 El Prado was a judge and after the Civil War they lost all their land

114
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
Beavis one-off

115
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:55,167
To the two different girl skulls both were bad experiences so she only had three years of schooling

116
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,799
But her whole thing was she wanted to get out of with the again I understand that I've been to Wytheville

117
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,431
She eventually married a man named Norman Fell to the jeweler in Washington DC

118
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:11,039
And then Norman died and she inherited his Jewelry Company

119
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:17,439
Was not doing well at all and everybody said we'll sell it sell it

120
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:22,815
Glimmer Edith is a very different person she keeps the jewelry company

121
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
And makes it profitable

122
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:30,495
Biosource off the first electric car and the District of Columbia get the first driver's license for a woman

123
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:34,335
And basically becomes a woman about town and if she's doing very well

124
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,919
And then of course on a fateful day Woodrow Wilson Drive past

125
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:40,223
Who's that beautiful woman

126
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
Now his buddy he was with him that day that's a Grayson he actually knew eat if they had friends in common and so he's like

127
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,207
She like wow I can get this present out of this funk

128
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
I'm going to

129
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:53,791
Arrange this dinner

130
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:59,167
Dr. Grayson actually got Woodrow Wilson's cousin to invite Edith over 40 at the White House

131
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:04,287
And so that's how they they met the very first time as if so this arranged in her butt

132
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,359
The motivation was for Grayson was

133
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:11,199
This is the first time that Wilson that's sorta perked up after his wife died

134
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:11,967
So

135
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,575
Two beautiful one according to Woodrow Wilson what does she look like when she was young

136
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Pictures of Jojo

137
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,135
She has agreed

138
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,159
Junoesque

139
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
Figure out which is in a cheese sauce

140
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Voluptuous

141
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:29,119
And Wilson by the way was a very sensual man we don't get this from history but he was

142
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
Houston to sex

143
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
And

144
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,799
G58 you know she has a very pleasant sort of round face

145
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
But here's the thing

146
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
Edith Wilson was very

147
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Quick on the draw

148
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
She would had a photographic memory

149
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
And

150
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,295
Wilson love that he loved women who had

151
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
And we're able to banter with him

152
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,135
His wife birthwise Ellen could not do that

153
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:51,903
That she was

154
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,975
Very cultured barrier fine an artist in her own right

155
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
But you going to have this sort of Snappy repartee that

156
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
He has had and Wilson love

157
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,911
What years was not as taking first of all either

158
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
Was not looking to marry a sitting president

159
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
I said a very good life

160
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
She had her own money

161
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,823
If you could travel the world

162
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,663
She's an independent woman every time she had her own company

163
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
And so you know the

164
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
The marionette

165
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
President

166
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,319
Did not really appeal to her but how did he win her over I guess

167
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:24,159
Otwell Woodrow Wilson then started

168
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
To do what he always does

169
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
He started to write

170
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,999
Lots and lots

171
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
Lots of love letters

172
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:38,495
Did you bring a copy of one of these love letters me see if I can pull it up here

173
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:39,519
The off

174
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,055
Phone

175
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
I had it and now

176
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
I hear you guys ready

177
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,575
Don't actually like what is this like when they're still dating or are they married

178
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
Actually I this is

179
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
The Lusitania was just sunk

180
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
Quick note here that was a penia was an ocean liner that was attacked by a German U-Boat back in 1915

181
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
Massive massive loss of life

182
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:13,055
Something like a thousand people died more than a hundred of them Americans and

183
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:18,175
This is actually one of the things that helps bring the us into World War 1

184
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,967
President Woodrow Wilson

185
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
The proclamation

186

Any help as The Story Goes

187
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
Right after the Lusitania was sunk

188
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,415
People rush into Woodrow Wilson's office

189
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,999
Tell him they got to go mr. president the Lusitania was just on

190

Redis

194
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
Lusitania song

195
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,871
My darling my darling

196

If ever again I have to be with you for an hour and a half with only two stolen glasses to express my all but

197
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,087
Irresistible desire to take you in my arms

198
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Smother you with kisses

199
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927

200
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
Are you go

201
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,655
He lays it on thick I think yeah purple prose is the word here

202
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,727
Auburn water park

203
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,775
Now how did they date

204
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Here's how they did something interesting

205
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
Get a big Pierce Arrow

206
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,199
And it would take this car way out into the country

207
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,503
And pull the curtain your head like that

208
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,063
Agent Starling one Secret Service guy

209
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
Any basically make out in the back of the car

210
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,231
While they're taking me through to absolutely absolutely

211
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,191
I didn't think it did it go out and stop

212
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,751
Field they recite poetry

213
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
They were modern couple in that they would have fun

214
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,175
So few months after they start dating Woodrow really wants to marry Edith

215
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:59,295
And this is a problem for some of the people in his Circle he's advisors Colonel house

216
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,367
Is one main advisor did not want this to happen he thought of

217
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Terrible for the 19th

218
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
16 election

219
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,439
Because

220
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,463
As it turns out

221
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,791
Woodrow Wilson actually had an affair when he was married to his first

222
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
He had an affair

223
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
Was another woman named Mary pack

224
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,423
And he wrote Mary pack

225
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
A bunch of Love Letters as he does everybody

226
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
Okay so no one is going to marry this

227
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,663
Is advisor Colonel house who doesn't want this marriage to happen start to Rumours at these letters going to be

228
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Published

229
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
And so Wilson freaks out

230
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
And sent a letter to eat

231
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,063
Basically saying

232
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
I had an affair

233
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
I'm sure you don't want to be with me

234
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
And delivered by doctor Grace

235
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
Anto

236
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Even sits there

237
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
Cheap she thinks about it all night long by the morning

238
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
You know what the past is the past

239
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,655
Writing back a letter she doesn't hear from for 3 days

240
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,495
And then Grayson appears that our door and says You must come with me to the White House

241
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
They go to Lighthouse go up to the bedroom

242
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,567
Wilson is in bed

243
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,151
And she's like 10 you get my letter and he saw the knot

244
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
I 3 months later he goes I have a confession

245
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
She says what's that

246
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
I had your letter but I never opened

247
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,575
I couldn't bear to open

248
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
So they opened it together

249
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,463
But think about that a sitting president has gone to bed because his girlfriend is about to Gilton

250
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
So

251
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
You know this guy

252
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,303
Skinny guy. He's he's a mess

253
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,727
So what's up fast

254
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
Forward a bit

255
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,799
When did

256
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
When did he start getting

257
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,431
Sick so 1919

258
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,295
Alright well one is ended

259
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
At this point

260
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,207
You didn't Woodrow have been married about four years comes home with the League of Nations to try and get it

261
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,511
President Wilson's League of Nations

262
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:51,167
The First Assembly of the League of Nations was held in the League of Nations as part of the peace deal that ended World War 1

263
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:57,567
And it was Woodrow Wilson idea actor

264
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:03,967
Out of this war that killed an estimated 20 million people you wanted to create an organization that would keep the world

265
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,831
Going to war again but

266
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,743
It didn't look like Congress is going to support it and retirement Lodge Republicans are like no

267
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:21,631
And that's because of article acts provision that would have committed American troops to help a member Nation

268
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
Under attack

269
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,215
We are not going to commit to sending troops around the world

270
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,031
Enter Wilson says you know what I'm going to

271
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Take it to the

272
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
At this point

273
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,271
Because on a Whistle Stop

274
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,063
Car 10000 miles

275
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
22 days

276
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,879
Whistle Stop tour is a berry

277
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,463
Cupping for a healthy person

278
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,303
Fresh Outlast you're giving all these speeches it's brutal

279
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
And welcome isn't well

280
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,887
Wilson had history of stroke

281
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
Migraines

282
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:58,751
Depression go outside of Pueblo Colorado

283
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:05,151
Wilson has a stroke and he called the EU

284
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,783
Ethan says can you come here he can't move his right arm his head is pounding me from these

285
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:16,927
Excruciating high blood pressure so they quickly decide to stop

286
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
The Whistle Stop tour

287
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
Head back to Washington

288
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,887
Washington Wilson seems to get better

289
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:32,031
He goes to bed and then in the middle of the night uses up she hears this thump in the bathroom

290
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
Goes in

291
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,591
And finds Woodrow Wilson

292
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,639
Laying on the floor with his head bloody

293
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,663
Out

294
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
Grayson Thompson

295
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:45,855
Says the immortal words my God the presents paralyzed so what happened to him was he had a thrombosis a blood clot

296
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
And his brain

297
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Stroke

298
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
The paradise entire left side of them

299
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
He couldn't talk

300
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:52,767
Speak

301
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
He ebase was very close to death

302
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
At this point

303
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
So

304
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,495
Then what happens is they bringing only specialist and they all come and examine

305
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
And then they decide

306
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
Only chance

307
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
Did they hide them away

308
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:08,639
Can you get the rest

309
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Which is basically

310
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
What year was for anything they couldn't solve

311
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
Heart ailments

312
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,015
Anything girl

313
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
Until

314
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
They all turned to eat

315
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
They said

316
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
Any stress will kill it

317
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Kill him

318
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
You got to take

319
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
Takeover will help

320
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,023
You have to

321
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
To take over

322
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,095
And keep all the problem from him

323
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,215
And that's the moment earlier an inauguration

324
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,007
What about vice-president Marsh

325
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
No

326
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
You can do this

327
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
I'm we need you

328
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
To do this and from then on

329
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,663
Edith Wells

330
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Depressant

331
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
So that's

332
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,575
That seems bananas to me that nobody is like

333
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
Should the president resign

334
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,719
Should he like it isn't it that's just not even like really

335
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,279
Mucc does ask about the vice president but like

336
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:02,399
Why is why is it automatically like he should stay president in

337
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,679
You know technically

338
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,263
While she runs a company why do you think everybody in this kind of Rush

339
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
That that was

340
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
The perfect solution

341
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Well because of this

342
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,615
The League of Nations

343
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Was Wilson's baby

344
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
This is what your stake in his whole press

345
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
The belief was

346
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
It if Wilson lost the president

347
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
Republicans knew you was sick

348
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
It would kill him to lose

349
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
The League of Nations

350
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
And

351
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
And they sought

352
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
You know what he could recover

353
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
So they can

354
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Conspiracy

355
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,839
Includes

356
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Edith

357
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
Wilson secretary Justice multi-doctor Darko

358
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
A neurologist

359
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Wilson

360
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,543
And Wilson's good friend and Crystal physician doctor Grayson

361
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
Right but he starts putting out releases saying

362
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
The president is suffering from nervous

363
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
He's in his bag

364
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
Until they started to paint

365
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
This

366
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,551
Idea

367
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
The presidency

368
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Yes he's

369
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
Lll

370
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
But his mind is

371
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
Clear and he's running the country

372
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:04,351
Write an end where is our vice president now this didn't he want to become president

373
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
Vice president

374
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:06,911
So

375
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,447
Marshall bikes going on

376
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:12,287
Speaking towards you like getting money at what he's really not interested in being president

377
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
So when this happen

378
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,359
Didn't even tell him

379
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,223
Exact date and time for two weeks later finally finally some people

380
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Prodim

381
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,295
And say you should go up and demand to see the

382
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
So it goes to the White House

383
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
Edith Wilson meet him at the door and

384
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
I'm here to see the president

385
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Anita says

386
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,767
Will let you know if we need you

387
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
That was a

388
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:37,119
He said okay turned around and left

389
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
Yes I can you just like

390
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:44,799
He was not in some kind of House of Cards way you know conspiring to like take over the phone

391
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,895
The opposite of Frank underwear he did not want

392
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
The presidency at all

393
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
So it is Wilson is running the White House

394
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
Okay so let's start with

395
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
What happens when she assumes

396
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
The presidency

397
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
Do you set up a desk outside the presidential bedroom

398
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,047
And she wouldn't eat cabinet members and everybody else there

399
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
And as people approached with papers to be sign appointments to be approved

400
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,263
And Welfare and get his take on a if he could talk

401
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,103
Otherwise she would just write on there the president can't deal with this

402
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:23,967
In day-to-day running Wilson cannot participate so Edith

403
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
What a lot of times

404
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,319
Cover the appointments of people in the cabinet

405
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
How she would take

406
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
Young people who had to be ambassador

407
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,695
In fact she would get laundry list

408
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
Of thing she had to do

409
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
You know this sort of a running checklist

410
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
Edison bulbs

411
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,095
State

412
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,631
Foreign policy

413
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:48,031
Cabinet appointments at Railroad Strike that she had to handle there was this big wheat sale to Russia

414
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
And of course

415
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
The League of Nations

416
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
Solar power is a river with flow up

417
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
2

418
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:58,015
The door and then eastwood-directed white Sochi governed by

419
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,343
She governed by deciding what was imported

420
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,927
Now question is who's signing bills and everything else

421
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,207
Well

422
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Uber

423
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:12,863
His personal valet said that he has would take his hand that would be Woodrose hand and move it on document

424
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
To emulate his

425
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
His signature

426
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
At a point she just artscience

427
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,007
Edith Wilson

428
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,543
Had very childlike

429
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
I can write

430
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Wilson

431
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
Had this very ornate

432
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,663
Princeton

433
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
Signature

434
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,527
And so what started coming back to people was his sort of childlike scroll with you

435
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,599
Little circle

436
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Exactly

437
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,463
And he says people started to get suspicious

438
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,863
And so what about like Congress and and everything that is on call for any hearings or investigations or anything like

439
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,399
White people in Congress new

440
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
In fact the guy named Turner Falls

441
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,215
Stood up

442
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
Senate chamber in and said

443
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,847
President Wilson is not running the White House

444
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
We have a president resign

445
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,199
Mrs. Wilson is running the White House

446
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
People knew this but

447
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,367
They didn't have a Smoking Gun and also every time

448
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
This would come out

449
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,183
Dr. Grayson wood counter

450
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,487
What's another press release saying things like

451
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
Wilson's doing great

452
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,423
Your President Wilson is so fat I wish I was as fit as President Wilson any but he did point out that

453
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,519
A lot of reporters were actually pretty close to the truth

454
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,103
The New York Times and other newspapers would occasionally come out and say

455
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
We think Wilson had a stroke

456
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,223
We sink

457
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,271
Is muffin is running the White House

458
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,319
And so it is with

459
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,599
We have to get them out

460
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:41,439
And so what she did what she had a special ramp built in the back of the White House

461
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,767
Had the big Pierce-Arrow portable she looks like an atom

462
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:51,423
And they put Wilson they forgot a Coney Island wheelchair modified it put Wilson

463
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,959
Push them back there

464
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:58,335
Then they lifted and put a suit on and put his hat on him lift him into the car put his right side out that

465
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,871
You know was I paralyzed

466
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,663
And then they drove around washing

467
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:05,247
With Wilson saying up as a sort of macabro you're waiting

468
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
Action figure

469
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,831
But people and even New York Times reported

470
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,415
That they saw the president's the present was out for a drive

471
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,231
She was manipulating

472
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,767
The image and the price

473
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
In-N-Out it was very good at that

474
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,351
Wonder

475
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:26,751
Is the president or a cuz I mean sometimes you let you know like I understand you know she's she's she's governing by access

476
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
Any issue really the president or is he just more like a

477
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,895
The staff is she more like a president is not

478
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
A reactive

479
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
Proactive

480
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,527
Position and Wilson could not be proactive

481
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Anything

482
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,367
The real Smoking Gun and all this

483
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,647
It's in the papers wardrobe

484
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,951
Up to 1990

485
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Everything was

486
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
Dear mr. president

487
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
After 19:9

488
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
Everything became dear mrs.

489
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
Wilson

490
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,911
Remember all things were carried on by quora

491
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Facts

492
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
Email obviously

493
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:01,567
So these letter show that the power shifted from him

494
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
To her

495
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Greaser Tracy hunt

496
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,159
From Radiolab with outline of the 25th Amendment

497
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,976
William hazelgrove book is called Madam president.

498
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,024
Presidency of Edith Wilson

499
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,352
Play my Talisman that story and then life

500
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Seems like maybe we should

501
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
To have a play

502
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
Land for all that

503
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,752
Present has a stroke and there's no plan

504
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
For what to do

505
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
Will turns out it would take

506
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
48 more years

507
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,896
For us to figure this out

508
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
JFK's assassination in 92

509
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
63 push

510
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Congress

511
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
To really make things a fish

512
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
Show land on February 10th 90

513
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
7

514
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
25th Amendment ratified

515
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,672
Basically setting in stone

516
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
The official

517
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Succession plan

518
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,048
And a fraud purposes for the album

519
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
The most perfect album

520
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,120
Devendra Banhart

521
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,680
Wrote a song for us where he Bass

522
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
Basically lays it out

523
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
In song

524
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
I love it

525
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824

1600 Washington DC

527
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,320
Even though I'm at the bottom of the list

528
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,648
Allura and never wanted

529
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416

Please pay attention

531

1700 Steel

533
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,448
Today

534
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:38,848
When the president

535
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
Completely rearranged

536
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:48,576
And even worse than an endocrine moral compass in a developing code of ethics

537
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:56,000
Ensalada what house they win the next game the vice president

538
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:02,400
How much drywall after seeing Lincoln's ghost Oso Berry in the Sun

539
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:09,568
Down the hall

540
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
Who presented newspaper

541
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:19,296
Facebook

542
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
Glendale

543
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,160
And so the president

544
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Gluten

545
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
Shota

00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:34,912
But soon discovered said no Riku left the White House

10 minutes

550
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:04,096
This'll be the Secretary of Defense

551
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:10,496
It was a miracle that they survived after ingesting gentian weed with a Havasu by

552
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,336
Calendar of the month of June

553
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:20,992
Attorney General

554
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:33,792
Inside the Secretary of interior the feeling morally Superior

555
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,192
Look up that night on the dock website

556
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:45,312
Jerry veracocha became depressed but a heart attack at me

557
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,664
Enceladus secretary

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,344
The debut on Pennsylvania Avenue but after sniffing too much glue. One more day could they get through

559
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,864
When they suggested again

560
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:17,568
Sensor the Secretary of Health and Human Services we chose but their willingness to expose

561
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:21,664
The truth about UFOs

562
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,064
And so the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development they did but they read the

563
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:37,280
And so the Secretary of Transportation welcome to

564
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,632
Subway stop that way and services yet to be restored

565
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,576
Living skin

Ensuing game the Secretary of Education

It states or by any state

597
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,240
On account of a

598
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
26th Amendment

599
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,824
Is all about giving young people

600
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,592
The right to vote

601
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
It basically

602
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
Represents this moment in our history

603
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Moments

604
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Floral

605
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,760
Where we as a country started to really ask her

606
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
At what age

607
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
Do people

608
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Should people

609
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,392
Have the right

610
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
To have a voice in our democracy

611
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,744
Prehistoric ari-tex from here

612
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
It all starts around World War II

613
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:24,192
In September 1940 The Selective Service Act was passed and for the first time

614
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:30,592
In history American boys were being drafted

615
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,664
And the love of your life

616
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:40,064
During World War II you had all of these young men who are about to be sent overseas many of whom were

617
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,464
18 but still don't have the right to vote because in a lot of States at that time the voting age was stilled

618
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,864
21 and 21 have been

619
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:59,264
Bike for a minute into a lot of people that didn't seem fair

620
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,152
Put the moment where people really really start to get mad about this

621
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,832
Is Vietnam

622
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,232
They came up with this phrase

623
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
Old enough to fight old enough

624
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
Devote

625
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,632
Fight at 18 died

626
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192
Old enough to vote at 18

627
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,752
And so with that

628
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:38,176
1971

629
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:44,576
The 26th amendment is ratified in just a hundred days faster than any other amendment in the Constitution

630
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:54,048
And actually it's interesting to think about this amendment now because

631
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,608
People

632
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,168
Recently have started to feel like

633
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,216
18 isn't good enough

634
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,008
Next to the youth vote

635
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,056
It's a little bit younger a group of teenage

636
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,640
Actress has won the campaign called 16 in USA

637
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,944
They want to lower the voting age to 16

638
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,760
In cities across the country

639
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Hi

640
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
Hi Alec is that you

641
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,880
Yes me

642
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
I'm good

643
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
This is Alec Shriners

644
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,952
And I'm

645
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,720
From washing

646
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
I'm 60

647
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,352
What kinds of things do you do like besides political

648
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
Work at a kombucha

649
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,704
That's that my local Farm

650
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,752
Yeah but I'm also a

651
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
Another neighbor

652
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,848
Alex has been in the news

653
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,640
But recently

654
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,688
Is too low

655
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
To 6

656
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,624
He's an activist with this organization called vote 16 DC which has gotten behind this bill in

657
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,928
In his hometown of Washington DC

658
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,464
To lower the voting age

659
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,512
After the Parkland Florida shooting

660
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
DC would be the first

661
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,864
To allow minors to vote

662
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
An interesting Lee Alec told me that that

663
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:07,520
Same argument from the Vietnam era

664
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
To vote

665
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,568
It's come back around

666
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
But in a new form

667
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
No not again

668
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,920
Another High School

669
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:18,016
All of the school shootings that have happened at least shooting at a high school in

670
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,832
Kentucky in Rockford Southern California

671
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,112
Littleton Colorado

672
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,904
They've created that same sense

673
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,232
But if people are dying in elementary school

674
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,280
They deserve to have their voices heard

675
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,560
I just

676
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,400
I think it's really frustrating for me personally

677
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
That it's

678
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,704
Taking aspirin

679
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
Shot in schools

680
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,520
For people to be like

681
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
You know what I'll give you the right

682
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
Right to vote

683
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:45,408
Alex actually says that he should have that right for more basic reason

684
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
Just think that

685
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,248
You know every two weeks I get a paycheck and I get tax

686
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,112
Take it out and you know where those tax dollars go that go into the council members paychecks

687
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
And the council members get to vote on budget setting

688
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,208
Conclude my hard-earned money

689
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
And they get to decide where that

690
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:06,656
It's not only that he says that young people are already behind the wheel we're going 60 miles an hour

691
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,984
Our but you don't want us to walk into a voting booth and Nino

692
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,776
Couple of boxes and make a

693
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
Important decision

694
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,592
We drive a car

695
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:19,456
When we go in to apply for a license we can choose whether or not we want to be an organ donor or not

696
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,992
To the basic point is

697
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
If you

698
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,088
Process to pay taxes you trust us to drive

699
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,672
You trust us to be part of the decision to donate an organ

700
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
Then you should trust us to vote

701
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,024
But here's the thing right

702
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,376
When I went out

703
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
On Election Day

704
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:44,032
To ask people do you think 16 year olds should be able to vote if they thought this was a good idea

705
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,104
Most of them were like

706
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
Now

707
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,016
No I don't think so I don't think so

708
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,112
Absolutely not that's around the time I get in the marijuana their judgment is off now

709
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
Is that a thing that people are talking

710
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:06,560
I even had a 16 year old tell me that 16 year olds shouldn't vote

711
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,936
And ask her why most people that I talk to you like that guy

712
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,496
They just had this gut feeling that

713
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
16 is

714
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,848
Really different from 18

715
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:25,248
Is 16 is not a certain things that are wrong with that age might not be informed about these issues

716
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,808
I mean I'm thinking of my kids when they were 16

717
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
People

718
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,392
Constantly are coming up to me after event

719
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,720
They look at me and they say I like like I trust you more devoted

720
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
You know I

721
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Trust you to make out more info

722
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
Decision

723
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
I trust myself

724
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
But

725
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,376
What about the other

726
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
What about the others

727
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,008
Yeah just looking at social media for have some gives you

728
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,568
Previous answer that kind of 16 year olds

729
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:55,456
Now to be fair just wondering if I could ask you a quick question

730
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:02,112
Somebody did think differently do you think 16 year olds should be able to vote

731
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
No thought into

732
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,416
Weirdly enough that's

733
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,232
Seth Meyers of late night talk show hosts

734
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:11,840
He was Voting right where I happened to be gathering tape

735
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:16,448
What's the weather like got reaction reaction is you could let 16 year olds vote

736
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
And we wouldn't be any worse off

737
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,544
You know you're like the only person who said that

738
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
Yeah I believe

739
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,152
I don't know. Now I'm starting to doubt my answer

740
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,992
Stand by you

741
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:36,160
And as the day wore on I actually did encounter more people who felt like maybe it's different now

742
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:39,488
All the musicians are listening to you are also talking about politics

743
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,512
MTV Has Fallen

744
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,096
So maybe there more were maybe 16 today is

745
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:48,448
Different from 16 back in the day

746
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:52,288
Strong opinion but you know what gun violence going on they probably do

747
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,360
Yeah today's most 16 year olds are mature enough

748
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,408
Understand what's going on at the light

749
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:02,016
Now from a psychological perspective the time people are sick

750
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,832
16 their abilities to make

751
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:08,928
Thoughtful deliberate decisions to consult with x

752
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,976
Experts when they wanted advice that those

753
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,024
Those abilities by the time people are sick

754
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,048
15 or no

755
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:16,096
Worse than the abilities of adults

756
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:19,936
That's Laurence Steinberg professor of psychology at Temple University

757
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
He says that

758
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,520
The research out there seems to suggest that

759
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,056
Cognitively

760
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,408
The average 16 year old Isn't that different from the average 18 year old

761
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,224
They're both equally likely to make bad decision

762
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
It almost sounds like

763
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,808
It's not that

764
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
Adult

765
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
Are smarter than two

766
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,136
16 year olds

767
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
It's that

768
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,464
16 year olds are just as stupid as

769
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,048
I guess you could look at it that way or let's just say

770
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,352
That the proportion of 16 year olds

771
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
Who are stupid

772
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,448
Is no greater than the proportion of adults

773
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Who are stupid

774
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,520
If that's the case and

775
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:01,920
It really is true that the average 16 year old today is more politically aware than

776
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,224
16 year olds in the past then

777
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,552
It really is hard to think of a reason

778
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
Why

779
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,624
They shouldn't have the ability to vote

780
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:17,280
You know right now 16 17 year olds and up me personally I have nothing that a politician

781
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Once

782
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,328
You lower the voting age to

783
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,632
Teen they actually come to us

784
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
And they're going to ask

785
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,936
They start to care about

786
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,288
When I spoke to Alex

787
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,592
The vote in the DC Council

788
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,128
What's a couple months away

789
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,176
He was super optimistic

790
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:37,760
That the bill had the votes that are needed in order to pass

791
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,832
And that it would become the law of our nation's capital

792
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,368
If the stars pass

793
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,672
You'll see 1617 old voting in 2020

794
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
I will be 18

795
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
At that time

796
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,768
But I know where you live

797
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,072
Wake up early that morning and I'm going to take my

798
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,608
Neighbors going to be 16 at the

799
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,144
The time to go vote

800
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
Realized you to be the first

801
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,448
6 year old

802
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,008
The history of this country to vote for president

803
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,152
Phil 22 - 778 youth

804
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
Vote Amendment

805
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
2018

806
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,480
Customer Allen

807
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
Thank you very much mr.

808
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,784
Chairman

809
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,416
Finally last week the DC Council met to decide the fate of the bill earlier this spring

810
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
We watch

811
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
Incredible voices

812
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Take the helm

813
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:22,816
Seletar country

814
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,608
We saw incredible voices

815
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Talk about

816
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
Gun violence

817
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
Voices talk about action

818
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,704
Incredible voices

819
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,264
Lead a national conversation

820
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
That the adults

821
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,336
What we saw Were Young by

822
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
People stepping up

823
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
Young people

824
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Were any cases 6

825
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
1670

826
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:44,320
That was councilmember Charles Allen who opened with that statement in support of the

827
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:47,904
After him another council members vote

828
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
Jack Evans

829
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,720
German again

830
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
What is significant unreadiness

831
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
On behalf of

832
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
Privy council members

833
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
Majority

834
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,096
So I'm going to

835
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,888
Make a motion to table this

836
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
Still at this time

837
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,216
He proposed a motion to basically kill the bill

838
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,264
There's a motion before us

839
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,544
Table the bill

840
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,080
Emotions

841
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,104
Cable is not

842
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,872
Debatable

843
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:12,224
The 13 council members been voted on whether or not to table the bill

844
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,760
And yes

845
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
Yes

846
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,672

847
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,464

Conor McGregor

850
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Snow

851
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,656
Snow to make a long story short

852
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,448
Guilin Hills

853
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Other measures

854
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Disabled

855
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
So for the moment

856
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:47,040
16 year olds are not going to be voting in Washington DC in 2020

857
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
But that's just for the moment

858
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,792
Producer sarkari without liner Note 4

859
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
26th Amendment

860
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:03,424
The song that came attached to it on the album is from a Philadelphia band

861
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,824
