Yeah I'm talking about

11
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,784
We're talking about a Supreme Court case from 1989

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,368
Today man has a story that he's been reporting for about 2 years

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,160
That we are going to play

14

So buckle up where's where should we start I think we might as well just

17
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
Start

18
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:13,984
Should I try to sound Southern with a guy named Woody connect from a lawyer with us

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,800
Essex Richards law firm in Charlotte North Carolina

20
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
Pick it up in 1985 1995 I was a very young lawyer I was 32 years old

21
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,320
I just started mine law firm and I was taking about anything that came through the door

22
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,112
And 1 days is 40

23
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,000
This guy walked in late 30s fairly thin 5.95 attend bonecrusher

24
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,280
Nez black

25
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:38,560
PS

26
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,376
Or was he passed away Mr Graham

27
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,960
The man seems to Thornton Graham and what he says

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Well

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,776
Like what what happened to your leg

30
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
What's with the crutches

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
And the thorn lays everything out for him.

32
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
So

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,064
He was pulled over on West Boulevard in Charlotte which is the four-lane road

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
Somebody he work for the city of Charlotte in the department of

35
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,952
Patient on road crews doing Road repairs

36
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:10,048
It was Monday afternoon and on that day wanted to join his friend to co-workers stop by his place

37
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
Is an

38
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,400
After talking for a bit Mr Graham asked to be taken to

39
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,032
Nearby convenience store it was only two or three blocks from his house he needed some orange juice

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
Because he was

41
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,664
Suffering the onset of a diabetic insulin reaction

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,968
Soda Thorn Hopkins from car

43
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:32,320
They drove over to the convenience store to store and got out of bottle of orange juice

44
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
Got to the checkout counter but

45
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
There's a line there

46
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,232
So it puts the bottle down and hurries out get back in

47
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
Find car by takeoff

48
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
Now

49
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
This is where the problems

50
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
Started

51
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:51,776
10. At the same time all that's happening there's actually an officer who was African-American

52
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,176
Sitting in his squad car and what that officer observed was a man hurrying out of the store jump

53
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:01,760
Tapping into a waiting car and quickly driving off

54
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
So you started to hail

55
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,368
The Thorn is friend but after a couple of blocks

56
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,208
Hold him over just to determine what was going on there

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,048
So he goes up to the driver side presumably gets to Thorns buddies driver's

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
Goes back to his squad car

59
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,960
Start radioing to get ahold of the convenience store to see if anything that happened

60
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:27,360
And it's right around that moment that the soreness in the passenger seat of the car suddenly opened his

61
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
Store got out of the car

62
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Circle the car watch

63
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:30,944
Twice

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,272
Lake Sardis stumbled around it when they sat down on the car

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
He started going

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,368
In shock

67
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:43,232
That was like a seizure he would have a really yeah and it was terrifying

68
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
This is the thorn Graham Junior

69
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,680
He was a type 1 diabetic what is type 1 diabetes been with one and two from what I understand the type 1 diabetes

70
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,752
Is when your body just doesn't produce enough

71
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Insulin

72
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,568
Any movie that seizure look like

73
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
Well one incident in particular

74
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,200
Art remembers being in church and he got like

75
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Is Blank Stare on his

76
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
Json

77
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,808
You see the beads of sweat come on his forehead

78
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
His body was siege up and he was shaking

79
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
He would bite his tongue up and

80
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,024
So I can remember my mother trying to let you know for sure spoon into his mouth to keep him from

81
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Biting his tongue up and

82
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,399
The main thing was try to get some orange juice and that way it would raise his

83
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
Blood sugar in

84
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,543
And what you got the orange juice in the heat sleep for a couple hours and then he wakes up and

85
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
He be exhausted

86
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
But he be alive

87
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
Alright so

88
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:41,087
Charlotte City street at this point four other officers arrived Its Thorn had actually passed out

89
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
On the kirb one of the officers

90
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,951
Rome Instagram over on the sidewalk

91
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,511
And cuffed his hands behind his back

92
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
At what point of what are you up to

93
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Raps

94
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,679
The Thorn by the handcuffs and picks him up off the

95
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Herb from from behind

96
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
Oh wow

97
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:04,639
The Thorn was sort of in and out at this point I guess he tries to tell the officers but it was a diabetic but he had a medical card

98
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,479
Ask the officer to pull the wallet out of his back pocket

99
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
And

100
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,527
One of the officers

101
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Sad

102
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,855
Ain't nothing wrong with the motherfuker Buddies drop

103
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,695
At some point around here the details are a little unclear

104
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Pretty nasty

105
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
A scuffle ensued

106
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:26,655
According to what is known as kasodus at the storm was resisting the officers and apparently officers slammed his head into his room

107
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Car

108
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:31,263
He suffered head and shoulder injuries he also ended up with a broken foot cut his wrist

109
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
And eventually

110
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,663
The officers pick him up one on each arm one on each leg and just

111
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,431
Throw him into

112
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,967
The back of a squad car

113
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,159
While this was going on a few people gathered around and how long after that the officers learned

114
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
That nothing at all had happened at

115
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,815
The convenience store there was no crime there was no robbery there was no shoplifting

116
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,119
So he drove them back to his house still in handcuffs

117
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
Hold amount of

118
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
EPPICard

119
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,215
Offended someone has gotten some OJ and

120
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
The office

121
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
Thesaurus

122
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Lay them out in his

123
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,847
Front yard took the handcuffs off and then just drive away

124
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
Was there an apology

125
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Oh no

126
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,111
Now what came out of that day in Charlotte

127
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,439
Would end up becoming one of the most important

128
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
Supreme Court cases

129
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
History when it comes to policing

130
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,143
And what you mean about this case is have something like you needed some orange juice

131
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:30,911
That

132
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
Something so seemingly small

133
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,871
Would eventually become tied to this end

134
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:46,271
All the shootings we've seen in past years mostly of young black men every time we hear one of these shootings ever

135
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,671
Every time there is an outcry every time the cop gets off this incident is looming in the shadows

136
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,999
Shaping the outcome

137
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,327
Many ways it is quietly Define the air that we're living in

138
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,679
And I wanted to know how

139
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,263
How did it happen

140
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,871
Rihanna

141
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
Supreme Court of the United

142
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
States

143
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:08,191
At 21.2 clock little bit I will say this about my dad now he wasn't someone that would

144
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,007
Would just lay down and roll over

145
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,407
Talking to storing Junior I asked him a little bit about his dad and he told me that the thorn senior grew up in the Southeastern North Carroll

146
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
Alana on a tobacco farm

147
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,015
He was a hard worker get student is sisters told me that

148
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,063
He was the first

149
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,391
Blacks or African-American accepted to Duke University

150
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
My grandmother

151
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,559
She wouldn't let him go because of you know doing this are right there that she didn't want him to have to

152
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,583
Experience

153
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
All that all that mess

154
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:42,495
This is a CBS News special report civil rights

155
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,519
Movement was

156
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,055
A lot of things otherwise this

157
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
Big part of it that was about

158
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,919
Police brutality

159
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:56,319
Los Angeles

160
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,719
Also what was the long hot summer of 1967

161
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
150 race riots across the country

162
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:14,495
Police station keeping teeth in

163
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
I will not accept

164
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
Charges against policeman I will not accept charges against policeman

165
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
This is a job not some wild-eyed cracker that made the statement although there might not be any difference

166
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,391
Not be any difference if you can think on that

167
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
You understand that

168
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:39,071
If we cannot bring charges against the policeman who have murdered us and destroyed our homes and businesses where were we

169
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
We go where will we go

170
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,983
She didn't want him to have to experience

171
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
All that

172
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
All that matters

173
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,103
So ended up I think he ended up going to Fayetteville State

174
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
Black college in North Carolina

175
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,223
Amanda Sorensen graduated one of the first jobs

176
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,319
They had he work for an employer call Dell Precision Springs

177
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
It was a steel company that specialize in making Springs but at a certain point you actually suing the company discriminate

178
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:09,535
Nation based on how they were treating

179
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,935
You know people of color so after that day with the officers and Charlotte one thing I do remember Dad saying was that

180
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
It wasn't right

181
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,239
Difference going to fight

182
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,871
Right and that is how he ends up walking into Woody's office on crutches in 1985

183
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,783
He tells what he I wanna sue the Charlotte Police Department so we went ahead and just filed a lawsuit in federal court

184
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,391
Woody takes it to trial and basically is ours going to the police but

185
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,415
Excessive force

186
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,487
That was totally unnecessary under the circumstances

187
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,071
Like they wrapped up a diabetic who is telling them that he was a diabetic

188
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Eventually the judge

189
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,423
Ruled that

190
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,191
No

191
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:55,359
These officers did not use excessive force and if you were going to claim that they did what he had to show

192
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:01,247
Police officers had acted maliciously for the purpose of causing harm

193
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,599
Hot today they had to prove that the officers X cement

194
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Darden

195
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
Yeah that

196
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,719
Woody and the thorn had to prove that the officers

197
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,791
Had it out for the thorn and we simply couldn't do that

198
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,607
If it seems like a really hard thing to prove

199
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,423
It's an almost impossible standard to me

200
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,215
I think it's important to zoom in on this

201
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,031
Stop. For a second because it's really kind of like the

202
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:25,055
Crux of the story

203
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,919
If the question is what should the standard be for holding a cop

204
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Accountable

205
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
Portuguese

206
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,479
Force 10

207
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
In the mid-eighties

208
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,343
Malicious intent was sort of the prevailing standard

209
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
If you're going to claim that a police officer use excessive force against you and the standard was that you had to prove

210
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
But the officer did so

211
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
With malice

212
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
In their heart

213
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,143
Why was that the standard

214
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,287
This is kind of hard to explain. I don't have the 14th amendment in front of me but it essentially

215
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,639
All you really need to know is that it was connected the Fourteenth Amendment to a particular clause

216
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,479
In the Fourteenth Amendment and this is why would he in the thorn lost that case

217
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,087
Okay alright so loses a federal court lose it Federal makes its way up to before it starts

218
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
Court of Appeals

219
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,463
That went nowhere the court of appeals ruled against us

220
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
Same thing same thing

221
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:21,375
Then nothing after that ruling what are you get the phone call and you hear me

222
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,215
From Jerry Beaver unknown civil rights lawyer

223
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:31,615
In the area in Fayetteville North Carolina Gerald was older and wiser than me that's your wording not mine

224
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:38,015
Mary had caught wind of the circuit decision you should not have to require that the police

225
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Softer

226
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,807
Got it in for you

227
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,647
I just wanted to beat the crap out of you just cuz it made him feel better

228
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,999
So I called Woody and said are you guys planning on taking this case

229
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,559
To the Supreme Court

230
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
McClain can't really afford that I said tell him he doesn't have to worry about that we will be glad to take it on pro bono

231
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
Oh and see if we can get this ruling overturned

232
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
Wechat drawer

233
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
Let's go

234
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,551
So Jane we get together and they start looking around like like what's out there what cases can we draw and argue that there should be

235
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
Different standard well of Glee season 4 cases

236
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:24,351
Pulling up in the court that you had lawyers trying out all these different ideas now most of the courts were using the fort

237
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:30,751
Malicious intent standard that appearing would have been like then there was also in the number of cases

238
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:37,151
What's the eighth unusual punishment punishment

239
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:43,551
From their totally explain what is cruel what is unusual it take the word cruel cruel

240
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
Play that you're trying to hurt somebody inside somebody's head right

241
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,815
The wonders of the amendment that some of the courts were you seen that

242
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,887
Woody and Jerry look to as they're sort of like

243
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Redeemer

244
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
The 4th amendment

245
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
4th amendment

246
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
The Fourth Amendment which is which is the government cannot subject citizens to unreasonable search and seizure

247
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
I have it on my legal pad

248
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
The fourth amendment is the right of the people to be

249
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,295
Secure in their persons houses papers and effects

250
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Against

251
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,367
Unreasonable searches and seizures

252
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Shall not be violated

253
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,231
It is seizure just another word for force

254
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
Like I have the right not to eat

255
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,143
Eating your shot by my government yeah it's it's not just that but yes it it also includes that

256
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,471
Entering so much about the fourth amendment is that in there

257
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
Is this one

258
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Important word

259
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
Unreasonable reasonable reasonable

260
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
The concept of reasonable

261
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,735
What is reasonable and what is not reasonable

262
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,319
In-law reasonable is it supposed to be

263
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
Objective

264
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:53,695
You look at the case from the facts of the case

265
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Not the wire

266
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,047
Correct then you ask was this person's Behavior reasonable

267
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,631
Or not they have to act with objective reasonableness

268
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,215
Wait a second reasonableness is a slippery thing

269
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
What you find reasonable would I find reasonable

270
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,823
Today will be different be completely different yes or no

271
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,223
It can feel slippery but legally the whole concept of reasonableness have hundreds of years of

272
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Precedent

273
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:24,159
I mean I I find this very fascinating and I don't know if you want me to give you like a little bit of

274
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,207
Backstory

275
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
Do you want

276
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:32,095
To give me a little bit of black stuff in it if it's interesting how it came to be and how popular it is

277
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,495
Take me to take me on the ride okay alright so we go back to the 1830s Andrew Jackson

278
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:44,895
No no actually we're over in Europe lower where is Belgium this is going to be like a little windy but I think it kind of makes sense

279
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
In 1830

280
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:52,063
This guy I don't care I don't care delay is a mathematician he's an astronomer

281
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,903
If you want to picture something he had Hollow cheeks he's big sideburns

282
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,951
A little bit like

283
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
David

284
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
Straight iron

285
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
Did the guy from

286
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
The Edward Murrow movie

287
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,399
Jason Bourne movies

288
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:13,311
Music that helps you at all

289
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
Observatory but astronomers

290
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
Habits issue

291
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,991
They had trouble pinpointing the location of stars because

292
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Telescopes

293
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
So bad

294
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,343
But Kelly was one of these astronomers who knew you could use

295
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
Asset statistics difficulty settings

296
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:33,791
You could take an average of all the different measurements and average of the meteorological data and I can help you pinpoint

297
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,655
We're stars were actually going to be in the sky so that they can make predictions

298
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,751
Whoever seems like revolutionising astronomy

299
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
Italy became

300
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,359
Fascinated by this idea of averages and what humidity

301
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
He kind of took that idea

302
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,967
I took it down from the heavens from the sky and

303
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
Started applying it to humans

304
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:59,391
So you can call me through data in medical journals trying to determine the average height of a person the average weight

305
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:04,767
The circumference of somebody's chest with each other like come up with these or proto-man Tennessee

306
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,327
Totally Arabic huge impact on public health

307
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,703
But he ends up actually going Beyond this and it's beyond just like physical traits and he starts to like push into

308
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,031
Man's morality and he's looking at crime rates

309
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Suicide rates

310
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
Marriage rate

311
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,431
And in the 1830s he starts laying out this concept

312
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,967
What is in French

313
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:28,319
Loam when which translates into the average

314
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Man

315
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,439
The average man so so this is like big data 1830 Style

316
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,535
Yeah and Indus idea Lomo and the average man

317
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,839
He became a very useful in law

318
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
English law

319
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Really

320
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
How exactly

321
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Money sign

322
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:50,079
In Victorian England there was Much Ado About people who wanted to sue for damages

323
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
Arlette the bandages

324
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,639
There is a need for constant average

325
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,223
Way take measuring stock to see if a person at Straight From the Block

326
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,039
This really seemed like the best way to determine if the accused

327
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,575
Had to pay

328
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,023
Here's how we will fill this need put a man on the stand

329
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
Adam raised

330
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,559
His right hand

331
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,959
Let's say he stacks of hay in a terribly negligent way much more like a funeral pyre caught his neighbor's home totally at 5

332
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
But he says that he did nothing wrong so Jerry I ask of you what is it that we shall do

333
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,943
How about think of ordinary folk if your average typical reason blog

334
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,967
Avenger

335
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Take a look

336
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,271
Epic use that hand

337
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
And ask yourself

338
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,831
This one question

339
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
Did he behave

340
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
Like you're ordinary

341
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Average

342
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Reasonable man

343
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Wow

344
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
I didn't even know you had

345
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
If it's okay

346
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
So you're saying that

347
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,567
Judges and juries begin to use these averages as a way to sort of like

348
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
Figure out like if you're suing somebody else

349
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,199
If it's somebody else did they act out of the ordinary where they

350
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:03,807
Yeah it was just curious after 10 delay in this whole average man thing that English law

351
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,135
Started developing this idea this standard don't initially as

352
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
The reasonable man

353
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Standard

354
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:14,559
Eventually switches a person to be a little bit more gender-inclusive

355
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
This reasonable person

356
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
It's one of the longest established

357
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:25,567
Fictional characters that exist in what is known as like the legal village where you have these other little characters like it starts with the reasonable person

358
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:28,639
And then you start you get like a slew of these other

359
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,735
These other characters that come out of that which is I have a little list there's

360
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,295
The ordinary prudent man of business

361
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,575
The officious

362
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,671
Bystander there is the fair-minded and informed Observer

363
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:47,327
There's the reason Bulger there's the reasonable parent there's a reasonable landlord there's a reasonable neurosurgeon reasonable civil engineer there's only one

364
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Reasonable

365
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Hairdresser

366
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,423
Really

367
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,983
Trade or craft

368
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,615
Where there's this is being done or you have the ability within your craft harm somebody

369
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,687
Legally it became very useful to have an average

370
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,223
Archetypal person

371
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Doing that crap

372
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
So that the jury or the judge

373
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,135
Would have something to use as a measurement when rendering

374
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:14,207
It's interesting so like in the hairdresser example

375
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
Whatever it was that led to that

376
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,583
Ray's probably was a Cadillac

377
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,863
Survey

378
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
And imagine one of hairdresser Behavior

379
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,751
Yeah lake lake maybe you went in to get a haircut and you walked out and

380
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
Half years gone right and you're just like we're to have my year ago and then it's just you go to Courtney like any reasonable hair dress

381
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
I would not have made that cut

382
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
Right

383
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Switch success starts with a C

384
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,527
Stronger and ends up with this

385
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,111
Village of reasonableness the funny thing about the village

386
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:46,975
Please this is pretty sure Kelly Prime in English law

387
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:53,375
Like Matt said there's like this Village of people but in England at the time they had this idea that it wasn't like

388
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,935
A village it was people on a bus

389
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
Call the man on the Clapham omnibus

390
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:04,895
Switches are roughly I looked up London bus route 88

391
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:10,783
I don't know they just ride the all day those people just waiting for the case to come up and do a hair dresser

392
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,367
In the next. Concept moved in like Australia

393
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:20,512
I was like okay we should use that until one part called that the man on the Bondi tram and another Park called at the man on the Burke Street tram

394
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
Hong Kong got it

395
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,352
And they said it's a man on the

396
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,424
Shang-chi one tram

397
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
It went to the bus

398
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,776
Convenient vessel to hold all these reasonable people

399
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,592
England said all these people are on a bus

400
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Because

401
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,408
You didn't want someone who's like

402
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,968
So slowly

403
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:44,064
That they are like they're not riding the bus really cold up in a cave somewhere or someone that is like

404
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:50,720
IHOP on their Castle it's like the Common Man exactly so it said it was described as reasonably educated intelligent but

405
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Nondescript

406
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
I think like what what Woody

407
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
And Jerry

408
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,608
Bring it all the way back

409
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:02,496
We're simply trying to do is to say we need to use the Fourth Amendment and his idea of unreasonable search and seizure

410
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,544
To create a reasonable officer

411
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,152
So we need to add a reasonable officer to the Village

412
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
Where the bus

413
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
So

414
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Riley the cases submitted

415
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:19,392
In 1989 almost five years after everything happened to the store and Graham that one day in Charlotte

416
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,720
Give an extra number 87 6571

417
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
His case went before The Supreme Court

418
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,072
Dethorne Graham vs enes Kanter

419
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
Now it's almost there for the argument was there as a spectator

420
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:31,680
Watch

421
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,960
Jay was actually in the case

422
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
To get butterflies of course

423
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
You may proceed whenever you're ready

424
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
The Chief Justice

425
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,104
Replace a corn

426
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,504
I'm pretty quickly these arguments you don't know what

427
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
Turn into like this word soup

428
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
Object

429
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,392
Standard free. Jerry

430
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
The lawyer for the officers

431
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,768
The justices

432
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,400
Getting super meta about what constitutes objectivity objectively unreasonable

433
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
What's objectivity

434
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,520
Predictive factor analysis testing standards

435
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:11,360
Anthony objective analysis bad Intent no intent

436
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
I think we're playing with words

437
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Until

438
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,552
One Justice Thurgood Marshall the lone African-American the Quarry

439
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832
Clumsy Ninja sass

440
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,160
What reason was there for handcuffing a diabetic

441
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,512
At the time the officers didn't know that he was

442
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
Diabetic

443
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
You had to be there

444
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,776
Yes to go back one step even before the officer Connor

445
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,312
Solo practitioner

446
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
Acting very suspicious

447
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Unusual man

448
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:49,760
Hurry into a convenience store

449
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,832
What did he do that was violent

450
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,392
Mr Perry's

451
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:58,208
Testimony of petitioners on Witness.

452
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,000
Petition was throwing his hands around

453
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
The Buried and ask for officer

454
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,912
I'm talking about this.

455
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,240
What was he doing before they tried to put

456
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,312
He was acting in a very bizarre manner

457
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,592
He ran out of the car

458
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
Circled around it twice

459
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
And then sat down

460
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:21,760
District Court

461
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,320
The officer didn't have to wait until he is

462
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,136
Did he strike anybody don't believe the record indicates

463
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,816
He was acting Indiana drug predictable and potentially dangerous man

464
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,120
Can you answer to

465
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
He did not overly threatened

466
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
Tri-County

467
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,520
Did he have a weapon of any kind

468
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
The record doesn't

469
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:47,360
Directions

470
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,480
The record shows that he was properly stop

471
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
Has a suspect

472
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
Criminal investigation

473
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,392
He was acting suspiciously that he was acting in a bizarre

474
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
Manor

475
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,464
Did even after he was handcuffed in the office if it wanted to

476
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,304
To put them in the car the Undisputed record shows that he was vigorously fighting and Kicking

477
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Abject

478
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,656
To being arrested

479
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,704
Rather than Giving Tree

480
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
He was never real

481
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,128
He was handcuffed because the officers were concerned that he was a criminal suspect

482
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
He was acting a very unusual and erratic way

483
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
He was

484
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,552
Throwing his hands around Indy The District Court stated from the record that he was handcuffed

485
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
Arthur protects himself

486
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:30,112
As well as the author

487
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,744
That's the VA District Court summarize the record

488
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
They are different

489
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
The difference illusion

490
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,056
When Justice Marshall

491
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Said that

492
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,616
Suddenly

493
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
I heard

494
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
Adjudge

495
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,272
Who understood our point of view

496
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,320
Somebody gets it

497
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,880
And all of a sudden

498
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,184
I felt like I was not an idiot after all

499
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,560
Then she put that their opinion is written by a chief justice William rehnquist

500
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
And

501
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,864
Inner pinion rehnquist says

502
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,680
Skip it down a little bit

503
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:19,008
Claims that law enforcement officials have used excessive force

504
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,664
In the course of an arrest investigatory stop or other quote-unquote seizure other free citizen are most properly character

505
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,480
Rise is invoking the protections of the Fourth Amendment

506
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:32,064
Which guarantees citizens the right to be secure in their persons

507
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
Against unreasonable teachers

508
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,136
And must be judged

509
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,464
By reference to the Fourth Amendment reasonableness standard

510
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,816
So they get their reasonable officer standard they get it

511
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,376
And it get it unanimously nothing opinion

512
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
Wow

513
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,544
It was a breakthrough

514
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:58,176
Stretch to say at the time to a lot of people were concerned about

515
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
Audi

516
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
PCS Forest

517
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,528
It felt like this was speaking

518
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:06,624
The new era that favored Plato's Enclave us

519
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,696
Is now if you were a victim of police violence

520
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:16,352
Justice you have this new Universal standard objective standard we no longer has a show that

521
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
The officers active

522
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
Maliciously

523
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:25,312
Sadistically

524
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,872
And you say what a reasonable officer do the same thing

525
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
Or not

526
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:35,040
Established like what a reason Lobster is what they would do by calling experts looking at dad about age and rank and

527
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
Stranger things

528
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
What's up with that this would be

529
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,560
For the first time in hundreds of years maybe they would have

530
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,584
An objective

531
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
The standard

532
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
That was a breakthrough

533
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:57,568
After winning did the case get kick back down to the Circuit like what happens to the thorn

534
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,872
Everyone in the Supreme Court

535
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,152
The case went back to

536
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,200
The trial court level for another trial

537
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,736
Alaska facts

538
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:07,808
And sorry Mr Graham had another day in court

539
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:10,112
Another trial we picked another jewelry

540
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:16,512
Apache presented diabetic insulin reaction bottle of orange juice pulled him over unconscious and cough

541
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:21,120
Physical education broken foot lacerations wrist bruised forehead quad car

542
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,144
Front yard

543
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
The guy who did nothing wrong

544
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
I was beaten up

545
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,752
The case was given to the jury

546
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,032
Entry was told

547
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Okay

548
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,848
Knowing what you now know

549
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,664
Take the standards reasonable standard and ask yourself

550
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,968
Is what happened to the store on Graham

551
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Reasonable

552
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,416
Liberated came back out and I decided in favor of the police officers

553
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
Mr Graham law

554
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:54,912
Now what do you think the jury really focused in on the police officers perspecta

555
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
And from the office

556
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:00,544
Detective all they saw was a black man running in and out of convenience store

557
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,128
They thought you might be stealing something they had no idea he was a diabetic

558
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:10,016
I'm up he was a little bit out of control car creating trouble

559
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,320
Diabetic but he's a drunk

560
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
Mike dangerous

561
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:18,464
Reasonable officer would subdue that person

562
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,328
Excuse I'm so sorry

563
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
There goes the dog in yard

564
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:31,520
So when he was actually moving from his home in St Louis

565
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,128
Back to where I still had a lot of family in Charlotte okay mom back

566
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,664
Hopefully I ain't going okay now

567
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,992
I was just wondering did your dad talked about the

568
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:44,576
About what happened that day or do you talk about the court case at all

569
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
He didn't

570
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
It wasn't something that he talked about

571
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
Different Junior says that this tablet

572
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,512
I'm trying to get on with his life he started making

573
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,048
Can Furniture in his spare time

574
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,328
Going to church a lot

575
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,632
But he had his he had his trouble

576
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,192
He had a p ends up having sex

577
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,240
A substance abuse issues

578
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,544
So

579
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
And which

580
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,896
Fortunately you you was able to overcome that and

581
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,992
That was after the Supreme Court case after that's correct that's correct

582
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,344
So I mean I don't know if

583
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
His his

584
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,672
We're trying to deal with that was

585
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,464
Do substance abuse I don't know

586
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,168
When you were dehumanized like that

587
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,728
When when another individual

588
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,008
Where do they

589
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,616
It's you know it's it's it's kind of hard to explain Matt but

590
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,408
When on someone

591
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
Who has

592
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
Authority

593
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,528
Chess

594
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
It's like

595
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,880
It stays like they take something away from you

596
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,744
When someone does something like that to you

597
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,304
It strikes at your core

598
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,352
It strikes at your very being

599
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,168
And I think you lose a part of yourself

600
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
That you can't get back

601
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,176
Franklin senior died in the year 2000 he was

602
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
54 years old

603
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
But after his death

604
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,320
Is named lived on in this

605
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Ace

606
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,136
Naseberry

607
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Weird

608
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Way

609
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,864
So 2014 tonight after an unarmed African-American teenager was shot and killed

610
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
Ferguson Missouri

611
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,240
Not far from where does Warren G live

612
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,288
A white officer Darren Wilson

613
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
Shot and killed

614
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,336
I'd like teenager my

615
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,152
Michael Brown a reporter from CNN contacting me

616
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,432
And up

617
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
He talked about how

618
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,064
They were going to use my dad's case doing that trial as a defense

619
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
For the officer

620
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,648
The CNN report in pharmacy

621
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:00,256
No I had no idea the grand jury deliberated over two days

622
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,048
Making their final decision

623
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
Equation for surgery was

624
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,168
Did Officer Darren Wilson act recently

625
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,520
When he shot Michael Brown the determined that no probable cause exists

626
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:13,824
To file any charges against officer Wilson

627
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,408
You returned a no true bill on each of the five indictment

628
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,296
That was reasonable

629
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,368
They killed her baby man

630
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,952
Luigi

631
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,328
Play Bob Jack.

632
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:43,008
Same here shot and killed by two officers while holding a pellet gun

633
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
To ask what

634
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
Original police officer

635
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,128
Would do in this particular situation

636
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,712
Detroit found that the officer who shot and killed the 12 year old boy Tamir rice

637
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
Recently

638
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,808
Ben

639
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:02,720
Eric Garner grand jury in New York City has refused to indict yet another white police officer

640
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:09,120
Send John Crawford on 18 year old black man killed last month

641
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,960
Reasonable

642
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:19,360
Samuel Dubose police officer who killed an unarmed black man

643
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,408
Alton Sterling

644
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,344
Reasonable reasonable

645
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,184
Oklahoma Charlotte Police Jamar Clark

646
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,792
Philando Castile

647
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,864
Reasonable are you kidding me right now

648
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
Evolve

649
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,472
Where did Bobby

650
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,056
Going back down to 1969

651
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,736
And in almost every one of those cases

652
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,040
Graham vs Connor Supreme Court decision

653
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,320
How many people felt was

654
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:04,160
Post to establish a new Universal standard that would deliver Justice

655
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
Victims of police violence

656
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
It ended up doing

657
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,304
Feed sack

658
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,864
Prevented the victims from getting relief

659
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
Instead

660
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
Protected the cops

661
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,520
One person my colleague who covers cops describes it as like cops

662
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:23,104
Kopsia dislike their first amendment

663
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,200
Texas break glass

664
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,272
How did that happen

665
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:37,184
Can watch it app

666
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,352
More perfect will continue in a moment

667
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Radiolab

668
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,792
This is more perfect I'm Jad abumrad

669
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,144
Me to say a few words for contact police officers have dangerous

670
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,240
I think we can all agree and on occasion they do have to use Force

671
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,848
And we should say that the majority of the people who are killed by police every year

672
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Are white

673
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,968
But if you look at the number of black people were killed and you balance that against

674
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:35,040
Fact that black people only make up about

675
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,088
12% of the overall population

676
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
What you end up with

677
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Is

678
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
That an unarmed black man is

679
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,280
Roughly about seven times more likely to

680
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
To be

681
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,608
Killed by police in an unarmed white man

682
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Taqueria wants.

683
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
Add these numbers

684
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Are very

685
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,240
Disputed and argued about but what is clear

686
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,592
Is most police officers who use deadly force whenever charged

687
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,128
Even smaller

688
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
Percentage serve jail time

689
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
So mad

690
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,224
You actually let me just ask you

691
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,016
All the cases we heard about

692
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
Before the break that Litany of cases

693
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,136
In the past few years in every single one of those

694
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,720
The jury was asked did this officer behave like a reasonable offer

695
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
It should

696
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,048
And every single one the jury said yes

697
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328
Yeah yeah

698
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,096
Why

699
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,888
Well that's it because

700
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
The reasonable officer standard

701
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,240
Like from from the moment that it was created

702
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,312
I was actually kind of it was constrained

703
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,360
If you very important ways

704
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
Pure the

705
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
The jury instruction

706
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
From the 9th circuit

707
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,552
And this is what dreams members are

708
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:45,952
I told to think about when they have to assess this kind of use of force

709
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,256
Geraci told this is your job

710
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,048
The Back Eddy Primetime kilogram

711
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
Yeah

712
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:57,216
It says under the Fourth Amendment a police officer may use only such Force as objectively reasonable

713
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:01,056
You must judge the reasonableness of a particular use of force from

714
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,128
The perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene

715
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,688
And not with 20/20 vision of hindsight

716
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
Those those are

717
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,016
A couple really crucial

718
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
Phrases with

719
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
Perspective

720
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
Of

721
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:19,744
An officer on the scene so you have to look at it through the eyes of the officer on the scene and then

722
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,840
You can't look at it through the 20/20 vision of hindsight difficult yourself

723
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:29,472
Officer in the moment and look at the world through their eyes and and that's how you have to understand these things

724
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,032
Where did that where does where did that idea come from to that

725
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
Thumbs

726
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,640
From Graham the guy comes from the Chief Justice

727
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,664
William rehnquist

728
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,200
Pinyin

729
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
Which

730
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Tiebreaker

731
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,320
The reason why this particular use of force must be judged

732
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,416
From the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene

733
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
Rather than with the

734
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,232
20/20 vision of hindsight

735
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:54,816
And if calculus must embody an allowance for the fact

736
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,352
And this is extremely important

737
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,656
The police officers are often forced to make

738
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,192
Split-second decisions

739
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,288
About the amount of force necessary in a particular situation

740
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:07,872
It so if you can see this this idea of reasonableness

741
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
Is

742
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,920
Circumscribe

743
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,200
Fairy type

744
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
By time

745
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,040
It's not asking like what a regional officer would do

746
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,576
Herein in general

747
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,624
During a moment where

748
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
Where do you have to use Force

749
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
Instead

750
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:25,280
What is asking is what would a reasonable officer do in this split

751
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
Second

752
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,632
In this little tiny sliver of time where the force

753
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,912
Actually occurred

754
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:33,472
In fact that moment legally has come to be known

755
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,544
As a superseding event

756
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Meaning what

757
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,384
What is the meaning of This Is Us

758
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,456
Meaning of depth in that moment

759
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:46,528
That superseding event it is essentially it breaks

760
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
The

761
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,600
Chain of causation

762
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:53,696
So if you think of time is Justice like Continuous Flow this is like no

763
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,232
You break that

764
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,560
You stop that and you take this one little moment you pluck it out

765
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
And you like this moment

766
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,400
This is the one moment that you look at

767
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,680
That's all they can think of

768
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
And it turns out if you ask a jury

769
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
The question

770
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
About use of force

771
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
That way

772
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,896
About this one little moment

773
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,688
The Graham standard that many people saw it

774
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
I'm in Hope wood would help victims

775
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
The police violence

776
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
Does the exact

777
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:23,136
1% Mike McCauley who covers cops describes it as like cops

778
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:27,232
Kopsia dislike their first amendment they just think of it like as a shield

779
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:32,096
Okay so this is NPR reporter Kelly mcevers

Making sure that your spouse and your family like understand the stress of your job and they talked about going to therapy I mean it's like

835
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,927
Wow there's times when it's this really touchy-feely kind of thing

836
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,743
Overwhelmed

837
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Happening

00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943

Couple of days

But for our purposes the reason we were there other reason we're excited for Kelly be there

847
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,975
Is it a big chunk of the class

848
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,279
Let's talk about that

849
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
Is devoted Graham

How to understand Grand and and how it impacts their life

852

853
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,455
Start using Force for 18 years

854
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:05,343
What's the lake China outside of Chicago

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,879
Force policy

856
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,183
On a regular basis

857
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,207
4 *

858
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:10,975
Red

859
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:15,327
What I would do is show a video and then let's talk about Ranbir Scarface on this video

860
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
So

861
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,423
Find a projector

862
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:24,799
It is really interesting to see these videos from their perspective

863
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,591
Video of a

864
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,687
September 2015 a guy named Freddy centeno

865
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:33,503
Freddy centeno has gone to a woman's house

866
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,551
Like to woman's front door

867
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,623
And threatened her and says he has a gun and the cops

868
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:45,023
Pull up the other car there's like 20 feet away from centeno who's walking towards them on the sidewalk

869
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:52,959
10 shots 7mm hits

870
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
Frank long

871
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,263
I translate the white one

872
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,871
Jim's claim that happens in 1.566 second

873
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:09,343
Jim shows the lawyer for Freddie Santana's family

874
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,927
Is basically just like

875
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:18,559
It's it's an atrocity like this was an atrocity nothing about that use of force should be considered reasonable

876
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
Because the cops missed

877
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:25,215
Situation near Old write-up on Freddy centeno didn't create any space didn't get Freddy centeno anytime

878
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,495
Get on the ground

879
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
You have a chance to get on the phone

880
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:34,687
In the video shows the officers did not get a chance to

881
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
Respond to their commands

882
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,551
Search employees all these reaction clips and then

883
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,623
Play the original body cam video again

884
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:46,719
Hey Chris you see Freddy centeno they come to get on the ground he doesn't

885
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,047
Engine slows the video down

886
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,167
As you can see Santa's right hand reaches into his pocket

887
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,495
Gym passes

888
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,543
Things like take a look at this

889
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
Right here

890
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,967
Jim has his Frozen moment where you can see it at Freddy's and his hand as started to move

891
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,503
The movement of a hand a couple of inches

892
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Just

893
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:16,671
Starting to come up out of his pocket that's moment from the pocket to the out of the pocket this to Jim was the moment

894
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:24,607
Seems like this is the only moment that matters like forget what happened before forget that the officers rolled right up on centeno forget that they weren't giving too much timer

895
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
Space

896
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,911
This moment

897
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,703
Right here

898
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:33,311
Start pulling his hand out of his pocket this is the moment where you ask a question

899
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,615
What would a reasonable officer do

900
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,919
Right now

901
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:43,039
Bach I can't tell what it is you probably can't even without outside information

902
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,831
Turns out he had a a nozzle

903
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
From a garden hose

904
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
What was the call

905
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
However you see this

906
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
Start moving up or down

907
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,535
He doesn't go to the ground

908
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,095
Pull something out

909
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,727
And so

910
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,543
Is this work under gram

911
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
What

912
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,271
I believe

913
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,111
For him he's just like over and over and over stresses

914
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:21,951
What would a reasonable police officer do

915
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,255
In that moment

916
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,839
What did you know what was

917
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,727
Text but rehnquist in the decision is like what rank was said is

918
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,591
Circumstances

919
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,895

922
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,855
Upswell in the music

923
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,951
It's fast and the court recognizes that

924
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:58,815
Jim plays another example of this one of the guy

925
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:05,215
Like I can police officer shot because they thought he had a gun got a knife but the cops got the call that he had a gun and

926
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,543
In the split second he raised his arm like he was raising a gun up

927
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,407
Another one

928
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,711

930
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,975
City girl look at just a moment forget everything else

931
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,303
And what you realize if you do that

932
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,863
Did you force someone to the jury to look at

933
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,495
Just that one moment forgetting everything else to look at this one slice of the eyes of an officer

934
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,567
The whole concept of what is reasonable

935
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,847
Ships

936
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,711
The only real question you can ask when the moment is so confined is

937
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,271
Did the officer feels threatened

938
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:55,903
Lake was the fear that that officer had a reasonable fear in that moment

939
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,975
That is a very different standard than what

940
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,791
Woody and Jerry in the thorn Graham that intended

941
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,351

She doesn't know who the guy is

961
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:25,759
Alarm systems going off

962
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:32,159
And you can hear screaming turn off the alarm turn off the alarm in the background and you can hear him

Pressure on our way okay

967
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,823
Now we don't know why John Farrell was banging on the door but

968
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,103
Very possible

969
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,383
They likely

970
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,711
It was just because he wrecked his car and need some help

971
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:01,599
So they called him thinking that they are going to the scene of a breaking and entering

972
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,999
There's a dash cam video from the squad car when the officers description it's an African American man with green shirt and light pink

Walking on side the road

976
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
Walking towards

977
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,287
Squad cars you see the red light of a taser on

978
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
Cast

979
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,847
And then

980
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:29,247
Take off one of the officers is yelling at me get on the ground zero keeps running runs off camera

981

Any dyes

988
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:59,455
Are that here's a guy who was unarmed who did nothing wrong

989
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,991
And he was killed

990
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,015
Plain and simple

991
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:05,599
Well if you you asked was that reasonable on some basic level

992
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
No

993
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,415
It was not reasonable this man

994
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
Should not have died

995
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,535
What in the trial this case did go to a trial jury trial

996
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,095
The jury was instructed forget everything

997
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
But that moment of force

998
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,447
It's like no 20-20 hindsight look at just a superseding moment

999
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,495
And then ask the question again

1000
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,567
Why is it reasonable for the officer to pull the trigger

1001
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
Ie

1002
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,871
Was it reasonable

1003
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,151
Prevent officer

1004
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
To be afraid

1005
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,063
And the officer who shot and killed Jonathan Ferrell

1006
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,623
Who's facing charges his name is Randall Kerrick

1007
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,951
You've been tried for voluntary manslaughter the suspect

1008
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:44,511
Began aggressively coming towards me

1009
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,047
And during the course of this trial officer

1010
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,375
The character cast and could you tell the jury about

1011
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,167
What pace he was coming at you

1012
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,007
At first it was a pretty rapid pace

1013
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,823
Moreland morva a fast walk

1014
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,175
I gave loud verbal commands for him to stop and get on the ground

1015
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,735
How loud are your verbal commands

1016
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,551
Very loud

1017
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:12,415
Tell me how loud you were yelling to the suspect and what you were yelling to the suspect

1018
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,815
So he says he was running at him

1019
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,119
This is a huge question

1020
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,655
Was he running Adam

1021
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,191
Really running away from

1022
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,751
I try to run past them by him yeah

1023
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:32,639
Like if you sort of diagram the whole thing out the way the cop cars were parked awake Eric was standing

1024
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,175
It is possible

1025
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:39,807
The Jonathan fair was trying to start a run between the mall at the prosecution was saying defense was like no no no

1026
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,087
Running at the cop

1027
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
Didn't suspect saying

1028
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,415
No sir

1029
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,975
Why did you interpret his

1030
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,511
Body language to me

1031
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,815
He's going to attack me

1032
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:55,423
He's going to take my gun from me

1033
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,775
Did you have time to holster your weapon

1034
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,311
No sir

1035
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
And here I was

1036
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
Suspect

1037
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,431
Match the description

1038
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,735
He just ran through a taser

1039
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,807
Which at the time I thought was had that work

1040
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,599
I thought the taser had struck him

1041
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,879
Make contact

1042
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,719
I had absolutely no idea if he had a weapon on him or not

1043
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,791
And was he at first it was the suspect ever still

1044
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,327
No sir

1045
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,911
Did he continue to advance on you

1046
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
Juicer

1047
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,751
No matter what I did he wouldn't stop

1048
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:34,847
I wasn't sure how many rounds I had fired none of them affected him

1049
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,663
And anyway anyway I didn't think my gun was working

1050
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,223
Thought I was going to die

1051
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,039
There's nothing I would do to stop it

1052
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,111
What was the reason that you continue to fire your weapon

1053
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,159
Because he wouldn't stop

1054
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,463
People trying to get to my gun

1055
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,071
Toilet down the question was

1056
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,375
Was it reasonable for officer character

1057
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
I feel afraid

1058
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,983
And after 11 days a testimony the question was put to the jury

1059
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,543
There were six opinions one way there were six another

1060
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,847
On the 1st going to the Jury Room it was six

1061
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,615
Sex

1062
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,431
On one side a white guy named Bruce rap

1063
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:11,967
We were sitting in that courtroom

1064
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
And we were sitting in that dreary

1065
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,063
Deliberation room has no bigger than this living room

1066
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:16,831
Okay

1067
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:17,855
And

1068
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,135
It's hot

1069
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
We're arguing where it's

1070
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,463
It's it's going nowhere

1071
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,511
And so the more it went on this went on for days

1072
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,071
And he started the leading the charge on that we have to

1073
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:27,839
Quick Care

1074
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,423
Pretty much adopted foster care can it be right to be afraid

1075
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:37,823
He told Kelly that Jonathan Ferrell the guy who cared shot so what Bruce Rafi sing to me like you know he was a young man

1076
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,615
Disheveled confused

1077
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:44,735
Angry if you will be made a very aggressive move towards these police officer

1078
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,527
After disobeying commands

1079
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,575
Choices in this video

1080
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,879

Put your hands up

1083

Do any of those

1084
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,535
Other than what you chose to do which was to charge

1085
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:58,815
Opticare

1086
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:02,143
And told that there's no other way around what I saw

1087
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,935
And then I kept coming back to that

1088
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,983
And this is exactly how the defense painted

1089
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,031
Write this case is not about race

1090
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:08,799
This case is

1091
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,567
Is about choice

1092
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:15,711
And that's stuck in grease trap he's mine so that when he was asked was it reasonable for character shoot him

1093
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,039
Cycle yeah cuz Johnsonville made all these bad choice

1094
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,831
This is an old trick

1095
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:21,599
From

1096
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
From

1097
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:29,023
From my defense attorneys spoke to an African American man

1098
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,047
Wasn't supposed to be

1099
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,631
He might have had a few drinks where he was

1100
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,959
The police responded to what he calls

1101
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,775
This was early in the morning

1102
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,847
This was far from where he lived

1103
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,407
This was this

1104
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
This was that

1105
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,223
Which caused me

1106
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,503
At the end

1107
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,039
To write on the board

1108
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,831
Just what did he do

1109
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,391
To deserve to be shot so many times

1110
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,487
Mystery Room in the Jury Room

1111
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,023
I wrote this on the board

1112
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,559
What did he

1113
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
Do

1114
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,751
What's the what happens with the jury

1115
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:12,799
Splits

1116
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:17,919
Bunch of Italians eat to quit Ford konvictt painters most of them Wayside with

1117
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
Quitting Cara

1118
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,015
And for jurors most of them people of color

1119
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,551
Side with convicting care

1120
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,831
Breaking news

1121
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,903
In the trial of Officer Randall Kerrick the judge

1122
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,463
Has just declared a mistrial

1123
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,559
2015 Espy Charlotte settle the lawsuit which on the Pharaohs family

1124
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,375
2.25 million dollars

1125
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,447
That same here optic Eric resign from the Charlotte

1126
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,215
Department

1127
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:46,335
The city paid out $179,989.59

1128
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,175
The money was for back pay Carrick Social Security and retirement

1129
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,735
An attorney representing them in a separate civil suit

1130
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,551
There's something interesting about

1131
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,343
Listening to Moses talk

1132
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,879
Guess what did he do

1133
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:02,719
To deserve to be shot so many times it feels like

1134
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,255
This time

1135
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,583
Fourth Amendment reasonableness standard is reasonable officer

1136
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,863
Standard like what

1137
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,679
Understand is that it was an attempt to really

1138
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:17,055
Look at these situations these shootings

1139
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
Uses of force cases

1140
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,407
Through this sort of objective lens

1141
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,223
Swear you're just looking at all the fat on the ground

1142
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,831
And yet he says don't seem to be tied that like any sort of objectivity

1143
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:32,927
Yeah hearing Moses where you're like oh that's actually like

1144
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,463
That feels like a

1145
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,255
Pure sort of objectivity

1146
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,535
Like what what

1147
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,327
What has this guy done yet

1148
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,863
Actually done anything

1149
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,399
He ran it a buddy

1150
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,423
Maybe

1151
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
But that was

1152
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,215
It

1153
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:45,983
And

1154
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,359
Like if you're white

1155
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:58,271
Are you more likely to say yes that was reasonable because he's white and he was afraid of a black man

1156
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,831
Like that is the question

1157
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:06,719
Given the history of our country I'd say many cases that's not even

1158
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,815
Thanks Christian I'm actually left with is

1159
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:15,167
If this is where the reasonableness standard has lettuce

1160
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,471
Is there another standard

1161
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,751
I think that's right

1162
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,847
This is what he can at again he represented the phonogram in that original case

1163
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,663
When you say it applied you wonder

1164
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:30,271
Whether or not this is the best standard or there might be something better

1165
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,599
I just don't have an answer to that

1166
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,415
I would I would suggest the whole more erratic

1167
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,719
Is Elie mystal more proof

1168
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,303
Next legal editor we ended up talking with him about this

1169
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:47,167
Shortly after the philando Castile verdict came out so he was

1170
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,495
Well that was a tough pill for him and many people

1171
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:53,311
Swallow I would suggest that they have to be

1172
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,615
The cops have to be right in fact

1173
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:02,015
Which is something we usually do not apply for what does that mean like it from in the scenario of a police person woohoo

1174
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,647
Is that mean like I need to be right that you don't have a toy gun that that's

1175
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:10,719
So if you shoot me because you think I have a gun I had best Havoc

1176
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,791
And if I don't have a gun your ass is going to jail

1177
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,815
Cuz you were wrong

1178
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,095
I don't care if you lie thoughts

1179
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,887
If I was telling you I had a gun

1180
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:21,471
If you are not right in fact than you

1181
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,495
Have to go to jail

1182
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,799
I think that is that would be a standard

1183
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,591
Several hours to prosecute

1184
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:27,615
Beast Boy socks

1185
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:32,735
Cinepolis person's going to just going to argue that like you don't understand the pressures that are under its

1186
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,271
The split-second decision

1187
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,807
Monday Morning Quarterback

1188
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,367
If you do what you just said we're not going to do our jobs

1189
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
I would say screw you

1190
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,975
You have had your chance

1191
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
You had your chance

1192
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,559
To police my community

1193
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,095
Without murdering us

1194
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,143
And you have failed for 300 years

1195
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
Enough

1196
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,287
More people might get hurt if I wasn't

1197
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,567
I'm willing to risk that

1198
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,359
I'm willing to try it that way

1199
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,175
I'd rather I'd rather

1200
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
10

1201
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,551
Illegal shoplifting people

1202
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,831
Go free

1203
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,367
Then one

1204
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:14,207
Illegal shoplifting person gets shot in the street like an animal

1205
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:18,559
Gotcha if you want to talk about changing the standards that is a standard changed

1206
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,887
Now that is a zelle said

1207
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,167
Radical

1208
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,215
Probably not real

1209
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,823
Given that most Americans according to polls respectively

1210
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,919
Confidence mclees Percy please to be the enforcers

1211
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,687
HIPAA law

1212
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,991
But there are other ideas

1213
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
Out there there's

1214
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:38,527
Starting

1215
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
Bubble up

1216
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,111
And what's constraining us if what's keeping us

1217
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,671
Stuck where we are are the words of Graham

1218
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,719
Then what offers does a way out

1219
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,255
Could actually

1220
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,047
Also be hiding in there

1221
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,583
What do you mean

1222
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,375
Okay so you know how

1223
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:57,215
Chief justice rehnquist when he wrote the decision in 89

1224
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:03,615
He put in all these phrases that took the idea of a regional officer and unconstrained it bro

1225
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,199
These were like it's been trained only

1226
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:13,343
To this little moment in time it's been trained to the perspective of the officers or constrained that there's no 20-20 hindsight

1227
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
All that

1228
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:18,463
What in the decision he also you slipped in this other phrase

1229
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,279
He was actually calling back to an earlier today

1230
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,583
And what he wrote was

1231
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:31,519
The question is whether the totality of circumstances justifies a particular sort of seizure

1232
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,799
Tality of circumcised

1233
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,591
Totality of circumstances

1234
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,895
It seems to be at odds with

1235
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,431
All of the other stuff

1236
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:45,599
Right which is all about like little slivers and moment

1237
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:49,951
Detecting that this is like this is the whole thing

1238
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:56,351
Both both ideas and their wants right now you see the lower courts are arguing

1239
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:02,239
About what displays actually means until half of the circuits are saying kind of like everything that we've already talked about

1240
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:05,823
Which is that all the totality circumstances means is that

1241
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:12,479
You look at everything to answer the question was the officer's scared you look at everything that the officer would have known

1242
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:18,623
Turn everything the officer would have seen received and then you ask okay knowing all that was it reasonable for the awesome music

1243
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,183
The other half of the circuit say

1244
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,487
Natalia circumstances

1245
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:28,095
Isn't just about what the officer knew what the officer saw and how it answers the moment

1246
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,143
Fatality means like totality

1247
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,703
Like what did the officer

1248
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,471
Do

1249
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,495
Leading up to the mall

1250
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,519
Did the officer

1251
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:40,383
Try to get a search warrant to the officer try to deescalate the situation before

1252
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,223
Are using force to be officer try to subdue the person before using deadly force

1253
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:48,063
Assembly all those things that usually kept out of the frame

1254
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,599
Maybe

1255
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:53,695
Can be let back in

1256
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:59,327
Supreme Court so far has shown no interest in ruling on this in trying to sort this out

1257
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,863
But they might

1258
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,703
Because the argument is happening in the lower courts

1259
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:12,127
So in a way we're kind of looking at a time very much like 1984 when does Lauren Graham got pulled over at

1260
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,919
Outside a convenience store in Charlotte

1261
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,015
Waiting to see whether it matters that the thorn Graham

1262
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,551
Wasn't trying to steal anything

1263
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,599
Maybe just a diabetic

1264
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,647
Try to get some orange juice

1265
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,119
Did what happen your dad affect how you

1266
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
Thought of

1267
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,423
Police how you thought police

1268
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,959
Bean bean black man

1269
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,727
Well

1270
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,775
You'll believe it or not

1271
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
It didn't

1272
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
What's up

1273
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,919
I like the base my

1274
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,223
Opinion

1275
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,759
It's based on my own

1276
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,551
Experiences

1277
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,367
My dad and I can say this Kelly

1278
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,719
I can remember my dad telling me stories of

1279
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,047
Where he grew up in eastern North Carolina

1280
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,839
On a tobacco farm

1281
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,119
In that small town

1282
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,679
I can remember him telling me a story of

1283
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,215
A black man

1284
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,263
Who have been accused

1285
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,127
Being inappropriate with a white woman

1286
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,431
And how the white

1287
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,223
Got them in broad daylight

1288
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,015
Castrated him in broad daylight

1289
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,111
And I say that

1290
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,135
In saying that

1291
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:30,975
Although he experienced all that stuff growing up

1292
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,535
And the racism that he experienced growing up

1293
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,839
He didn't teach that

1294
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,143
You didn't teach that does he told us

1295
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,679
To love people

1296
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
So

1297
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,519
Even now myself

1298
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,823
I base my experience over

1299
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,591
Four-person

1300
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,383
I base my experience of the police

1301
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
Based on

1302
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,943
My dealings with

1303
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,991
In and not that I want

1304
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,271
But I have yet

1305
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,295
To encounter

1306
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:59,135
A police officer who's been mean to me who's been rude to me

1307
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,671
Who's mistreated me

1308
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,719
And that's the God's honest truth

1309
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
Without

1310
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,535
Button and being completely honest

1311
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,839
When I see you on the news

1312
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,399
Like a kid in the 12 year old in

Infusion

Few short years

1337
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,463
He would be considered a black man

01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
Unfortunately

01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,047
