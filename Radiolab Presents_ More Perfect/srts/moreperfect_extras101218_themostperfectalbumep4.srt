Women have been fighting for the legal right to vote

103
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Since the 1840s

104
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
In 1890

105
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,343
National American women's suffrage association nawsa

Was established with Susan B Anthony is leaving for

107
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
But

108
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
Women have been fighting for their rights

109
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,583
Since the very beginning of time

110
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,919
Birthday cake we couldn't we couldn't drink

111
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319
They said we couldn't even speak

00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:57,119

Adam don't like rude but that okay

115
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:09,919
We have to fight for women's rights

116
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,719
Which every time because the time marked up and down the street we have to talk

117
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:41,919
When women finally got the right to vote

118
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,719
What state is Washington having babies

119
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
But we knew we couldn't quit

120
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:45,919
We protested came about

121
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:58,719
Rebuild the truth

122
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,079
With every birthday

123
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,183
On August 18 1920 women's suffrage amendment was ratified

124
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
Dolly Parton

125
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,831
The song for the 19th Amendment

126
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,207
I think what is implicit in

127
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
Lyrics

128
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,535
Such good word play

00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
In that in there

130
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
Umbrella Corps has implicit in in what she's writing about there

131
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
It's just what

132
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
A struggle

133
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
It was

134
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Not just to get

135
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
To the point

136
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
Having a 9

137
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,591
19th Amendment what to get the amendment itself rata

139
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,711
He's very tenuous moment

140
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,271
Could have gone another direction will this is one of those mon

141
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
It all came down

142
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
To the wire

143
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,439
Summer night in Tennessee I'm going to turn

Yes, most southern accent this is Carol Busey

Carol is a professor of history at the volunteer state Community College in Tennessee near Nashville

154
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,655
You all do understand that Nashville is now the

155
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
It

156
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,191
City

157
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,727
Seems to be

158
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,007
But for our story

159
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:22,591
There was a moment in Nationals history there was not just

160
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383

161
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151

00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,527
Vicious struggle for women to get the right to vote

164
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,599
It was the summer of 1920

165
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,511
That's an oral history recording of 101 year old woman

166
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
And Abby Crawford Milton

167
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
Who in that very hot summer of 1920

168
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,167
Descended upon Nashville with hundred

169
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935

Other suffragists like herself

171
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:51,263
Anti suffragists

172
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
Lawyers politicians

173
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Business people

174
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
They all came to Nashville for this

175
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
Pierce

176
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,991
Legislative battle

177
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Okay

178
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,183
Now let me stop here and take us one step back

179
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,719
Okay

180
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:17,119
And we're also going to bring an historian Jill Lepore at Harvard

181
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,519
She told us that at the end of the Civil War ran 1865 s Congress was considering this new Amendment which would give

182
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Former slaves the right to vote

Who work wishing

185
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:34,527
Hoping fighting to be included in this new Amendment women expect that the 14th Amendment is going to live

186
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:38,879
Any discrimination within the constitution on the basis of

187
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Race

188
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Color or sex

189
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,255
They had been the stalwart allies of abolitionists

190
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:50,655
And women are really important of the founding of the Republican party and so when they say they know y'all can you guys going to do the cement obviously

191
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:55,519
You're not going to forget us right like we're going to write this political Ramos do it like let's just do it let's get this

192
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,847
Done this proposed amendment is being talked about in Congress to beam

193
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:03,711
Perfected as being tweaked and it's about to come to a vote when almost at the last minute

194
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,271
The word mail is put in there

195
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:09,343
Amending the amendment so that only men can

196
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,439
It's the first introduction of the word male into the Constitution

197
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,719
So not only

198
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,255
Does the 14th Amendment

199
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
Bale

200
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:22,399
To guarantee women their citizenship and the rights of command

201
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
Privileges that come with citizenship

202
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
It specifically excludes

203
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
Betrayal we're starting back at

204
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
Square one so

205
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,991
Stop point someone that are like God damn it like all right we're just going to go vote and show for instant

206
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:43,647
Actually tries to vote they won't let her go to the Supreme Court I guess you won't be surprised to hear are you on edge of seas what is it

207
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,999
What are we going to do I can't wait to hear is it going to rain

208
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
Is it raining

209
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,679
Ladies it's so cute that you thought you were included in the Cubs

210
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
No no no no no

211
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
We love you but now

212
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,639
And then in 1878 Susan B Anthony proposed another amend

213
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:11,039
Address for the right to vote people laughed about it and then put it aside for the next 40 years

214
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,367
Was no movement at all on this amendment until

215
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
June 4th 1919

216
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Just after World War 1

217
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
After centuries of

218
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
Suffering suffer

219
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,887
Both houses of Congress finally passed the 19th amendment to give women the right to

220
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Devote

221
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,007
Amendment came after months of women protesting outside the White House

222
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:35,103
And years of working jobs that before the war it only ever belong to men

223
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,919
But force it also came with a constitutional

224
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,479
Catch it had to go to the states

225
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,015
To be ratified

226
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,575
Was just means that each state had to vote to approve it

227
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
This is something

228
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
I just break and it's sometimes a bit hard to

229
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,279
Congress can write an amendment to the Constitution but it doesn't actually go into

230
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
The fact

231
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,327
Until 3

232
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Quarters

233
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
The states

234
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Decide to go along with

235
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:04,799
Three-fourths of the state legislatures have to ratify the amendment that be

236
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
Well 36 in this particular

237
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
Instance had to vote for it

238
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,551
Now and then

239
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,111
Then we got to 35

240
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:18,879
States

241
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
And

242
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Stop

243
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:21,695
It just got

244
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
Stuck at 35

245
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,583
Knowing that the suffragists were only one vote shy

246
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
The anti-suffragist

247
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
Beefed up their camp

248
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
At which made it

249
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
Harder and harder to get that final

250
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
Allstate it was looking grim

251
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
Until

252
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
There was a Wednesday

253
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,151
Just one state that seemed

254
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,967
Like it might be.

255
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Teetering

256
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,647
August 1920 Nashville Tennessee

257
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,487
See legislators from all over the state start arriving at Union Station

258
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,791
They're just immediately greeted by

259
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,071
Ro and

260
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
Anti-Theft

261
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,679
Kind of pain either a yellow or red rose on their lapel

262
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Tell everybody

263
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:11,359
Across town would know which side they stood on that was Tom vikstrom he's The Unofficial historian of the very place

264
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,199
These legislators were headed the most fashionable place in town

265
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
The Hermitage Hotel

266
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
Pictures of Lobby during the month of August

267
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,183
Swarming with people both Pro and anti suffrage women cooling themselves

268
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:31,583
Palm leaf fans and of course no air conditioning man smoking cigar smoking politicians

269
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,191
Second floor mezzanine you have the headquarters of the anti suffragists

270
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:41,823
Exactly worth noting that a lot of the anti suffragists were women campaigning actively against

271
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,383
The right to vote they think it's going to reduce

272
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
In some ways their moral Authority within the household

273
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,015
Women belong only in private life not in public life

274
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
Public life is

275
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
The meaning and its

276
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Besmirch

277
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
So on the second floor you had to add Ties on the 3rd floor Suite 309 you have carrots

278
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,559
Chapman Catt leader of the pro suffer

279
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,191
She had no children and her husband had died she had devoted all of her energy

280
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Towards this

281
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,799
One goal of getting women the right to vote

282
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:18,687
So she's up she's the big Washington to Bigfoot from Washington is really much like a general

283
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,319
Both groups are there because this hotel is just a few blocks away from the State House

284
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,647
And they are trying to convince as many Tennessee legislators as they

285
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,671
Possibly can

286
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:35,071
Take them over to their side it was all kind of high Jinks and you name it eavesdropping

287
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Telegram

288
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:43,263
Or fake phone call messages

289
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,663
So the suffragists are running around trying to stop these legislators from leaving town while there's a room back at the hotel

290
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,271
Helicopter Jack Daniel's room where there was some Jack Daniels being dispensed

291
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,063
By the anti-suffrage people

292
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,135
And supposedly prosalvage legislators

293
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,487
Could be heard through the hotel walls singing anti-suffrage song

294
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
Tennessee is supposed to be dry

295
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
And yet

296
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,679
The ant has r

297
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,751
Flagrantly violating prohibition

298
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,055
By having these events

299
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,151
In which the liquor flows quite well

300
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:32,671
Closer and closer they got to the final day of voting it became apparent that people who had come to town

301
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:38,047
Saying they were in favor of ratifying this amendment wearing yellow roses

302
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,095
Started wearing red

303
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Roses

304
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:46,239
Red roses if you remember worn by the side that didn't want women to get the right

305
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
The anti

306
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,335
Yellow roses were worn by the side the dip

307
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,639
On the morning of the final vote

308
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
There so many

309
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:01,087
Red roses too yellow roses to yellow roses to red roses flip-flopping floppity flipping around that buy

310
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,927
This point no one had any idea what was going to happen

311
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:10,559
That's exactly right when does stop you here for a second is it now clear to everybody

312
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
Buddy that if the legislature of Tennessee passes

313
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,703
They will become part of the US Constitution

314
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,519
Oh absolutely absolutely

315
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,871
You know you didn't have any cushion states that you could go to

316
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,919
You know Nevada neck

317
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
There were no Kush

318
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
It's now or it's going to be a long time

319
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,879
And finally it's going to happen one way or another

320
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,927
On August 8th

321
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,975
Tank so the morning of the vote

322
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,839
The hotel starts emptying out everyone heads over to the state capitol

323
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:49,727
But misses cat because she was going to be looked at as an outside agitator

324
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
She decided to stay behind

325
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,615
In the state capitol in the house chamber

326
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,431
It's hot and humid in the room is

327
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,759
Hack the 96 legislators are settling at their death

328
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
And above them

329
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,391
In the gallery around the top of the house chamber Bend

330
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,231
Fire there along with the anti suffragists

331
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,327
And you can be assured that both sides have their little pads

332
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,631
Enter counting the votes

333
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,935
And islay look at the Roses

334
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
There are 48

335
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,799
Yellow roses in 48

336
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
Red roses

337
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,199
And all these roses reliable I mean supposedly

338
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:36,319
If you're wearing a red rose you're going to vote against it before the voting even begins

339
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,623
They can see that we've lost

340
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,695
Cuz you have to have a few have to have a majority

341
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,743
And the Speaker of the House

342
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,535
He had initially

343
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,911
Supported suffrage but he's really on the side of the ant Eyes by this time

344
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,775
And before they really start the vote he actually steps down on the floor

345
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,055
To give a speech

346
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,871
Against ratification of the amendment

347
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:05,759
So you know there's another letdown you know is lost we've lost we've lost

348
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
And two blocks away

349
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,135
Suite 309 of the Hermitage Hotel

350
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
Tits Carrie Chapman Catt

351
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,279
She was very nervous about what was going to happen

352
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,887
So what you going to do she said there is only one thing left to do

353
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
We can

354
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
Pray

355
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
So they start

356
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
The Roll Call

357
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
And as

358
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
These names are called

359
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
One by one

360
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
These men stand up

361
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,607
And voice their vote

362
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,703
If they are wearing a yellow rose

363
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
He say I

364
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
For women's suffrage

365
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,311
They're wearing a red rose they say nay

366
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
And among these legislators

367
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:13,343
A young man Harry T burn a republican legislator

368
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:18,720
From Niota Tennessee a 24 years old he's the youngest legislator

369
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
In the house

370
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:23,328
Small man little glasses with serious face

371
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,888
The air is tense and still

372
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Until

373
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Keurig tea

374
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
The young man

375
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,568
Stems from his desk

376
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,384
A red rose in his lapel

377
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
But in his pocket

378
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:43,296
He had a letter from his mother over there in Niota

379
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,576
Dear son

380
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,880
We've had nothing but rain since you left

381
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:47,904
Her name was

382
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,928
Stubborn

383
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,024
Uncle Bill and mr. Bushnell came over this p.m. State about an hour

384
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,096
They were in the Ford we haven't had that car outside

385
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
She left

386
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:03,264
And if this rainy weather doesn't let up I fear we'll all have to stay at home the rest of them really is justice

387
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,568
Ordinary letters Tower of what I'm writing

388
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,200
From a mom to her son he was real sick yesterday but was better this morning

389
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:17,856
She's been complaining all summer tucked into all of those mundane details about life in Niota

390
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,440
There was this little motherly

391
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Dig

392
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:26,816
A product I've been watching to see how you stood but haven't seen anything yet

393
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:32,192
You know son I've been reading about the suffrage fight in the papers and I really hadn't seen your name anywhere

394
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:37,568
And then she says don't forget to be a good boy and help Miss Thomas cap

395
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,152
Vote for suffrage and don't keep them in doubt

396
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,200
With lots of love Mama

397
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,552
Harry T burn is wearing a red

398
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
Rose

399
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,600
And his vote

400
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
He

401
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
Votes

402
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,816
For women to have the right to vote

403
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:05,472
So there in the balcony there's just a moment of silence what's going on here what's going on

404
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
You can imagine this you can imagine this

405
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
And then it don't sanya

406
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,384
Hey Harry's changed his phone

407
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,736
It's not going to be 48 to 48 it's going to be 49 247

408
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,600
The suffragist you can imagine our

409
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,928
Crying the anti Tsar Furious

410
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:31,840
You can imagine the total chaos here in this situation but there must be an awful lot of attention

411
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:35,936
Made the Harry Wright like what the legend is that the aunt has

412
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
Start chasing Harry

413
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
Through the house chamber

414
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,920
Harry is completely undone oh my gosh what have I just done so he jumps out of window not nash

415
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,968
Not jumping out of 5 story window

416
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
But he gets

417
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:54,880
Out of the building and shimmies down the ledge to the State Library which is in the same building

418
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:01,280
He gets in the window there and mrs. Moore the librarian Mary Daniel Moore

419
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:02,816
Hi Tim in the stacks

420
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,608
Until the storm blows over

421
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:11,008
Now that's the legend Harry really climb out of that window and he said

422
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,080
Jimmy Yang happen we don't know

423
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:17,664
How exaggerated that part of the story

424
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:24,576
The shelves from the hill carried all the way back to the Hermitage Hotel

425
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
Mrs. cat

426
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,184
Could hear them from her window she knew

427
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
They'd won

428
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
It was in fact

429
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
Pass

430
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,608
The certificate of ratification

431
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
Was sent to Washington DC

432
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936
And received

433
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
By the Secretary of

434
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,288
The final tally was actually 5240

435
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,848
After Harry changed his vote

436
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,152
When other legislators switch sides but

437
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,968
It was clearly because Harriet Janet first

438
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,296
That's right see that vote was the wreath at vote

439
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,624
Became the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution

440
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,720
Yes in the in a manner of speaking yes

441
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
After the vote

442
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,560
Mrs. Katz and fat burn

443
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,328
Italic

444
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,376
You are blessed

445
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
With a brave and honest

446
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
Sun

447
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:17,056
Whatever the enemies of justice and decency made do now to show their vengeance upon him

448
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
He's bound to have a great day

449
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
You will ever be proud of him

450
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
Carrie Chapman Catt

451
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:30,624
Well is political career ended rather short

452
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,904
But you know

453
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
He took his mother's advice

454
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:34,720
And

455
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:37,280
He did get his name in the paper did me

456
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Just a wonderful

457
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Pale

458
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,912
And I always would in the story by saying

459
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
Not just think about this folks

460
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
In the middle of nowhere

461
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
Petty Texas

462
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,664
My grandmother went to the Methodist Church

463
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,736
In November of 1920

464
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,576
With her four-year-old daughter at her side

465
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,928
And voted because of something that took place

466
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,000
Right here in Nashville Tennessee

467
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,072
Little Nashville Pride

468
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
Their Arts

469
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,704
I was radiolab's a lot of Nasser with Tracy hunting Robert krulwich

470
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:23,104
Just answer to sour the mood for a second and obviously a massive milestone for women in the United

471
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,920
It states but it was pretty well understood

472
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,224
By the legislators in that room

473
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,784
In fact that many of the women who was lead to suffer

474
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,552
Purchase movement

475
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
This wasn't a victory for all

476
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,672
This is a victory for white

477
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:41,024
Historians will tell you that this was

478
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,096
You know the 19th was great for a middle-class white women

479
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,376
Didn't do a whole lot

480
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
App for black women in the sea

481
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
I've worked for decades

482
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,288
Women and men of color who tried to vote

483
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
To deal with

484
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Literacy test

485
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,128
White only primaries straight up

486
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,664
Violence and intimidation

487
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,480
And I think one of the grand stories of the amendments

488
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:06,112
To the Constitution if you read them chronologically what you see is this the story of a country

489
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,160
Striving for these ideals

490
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,952
Not quite getting

491
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,768
And then trying over and over to

492
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,376
With each fix getting maybe a little bit closer hopefully fingers crossed

493
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
Is the story of a country growing up

494
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
Maybe that's

495
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,752
Too generous a reading but that's honestly how I see it

496
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,568
So after a v

497
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,360
16th and 19th amendments

498
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
Switch should have solved voting

499
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,664
Question with didn't

500
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,992
Jump forward you get to the 24th Amendment 24th

501
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,784
Abolition of poll tax

502
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,624
Which try to address one of the main ways votes have been

503
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
Expressed throughout American history

504
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:45,024
The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election

505
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,816
Shall not be denied or abridged

506
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,096
By the United States

507
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
Or any state

508
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,656
By reason of failure to

509
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
People.

510
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192

00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,336
Perhaps closer than any other band on this album

551
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
Sell clothes

552
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
So person

553
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,504
They've actually Pro

554
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,784
Performed on the steps of the

555
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
Supreme Court

556
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
Chicago

557
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,816
While being sued by the federal government

558
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
Beaches to put that in context

559
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,264
So why don't we start why don't you tell me

560
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
Your name and the bandier

561
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:46,944
My name is Simon Tam I'm from the slant so I've been a part of the band from the very beginning

562
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
I guess goes back to bed

563
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
About mm

564
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Xiamen

565
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
Spoke to Suzie lechtenberg

566
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,648
Producer in the studio the Slants

567
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:02,560
Are swerving all Asian synth-pop band to Slants how their music Chinatown dance

568
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:06,656
Iraq

569
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
That's a one-way they've been to

570
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
Described on the TV

571
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,520
Wanted to start a

572
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,848
The Simon told Suzy that he formed the band

573
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
Because he was tired of there being no Asians

574
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
In rock music

575
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
He chose the name

576
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,992
Very explicitly

577
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Because of the

578
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,808
Stereotype piano slanted

579
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Isis

580
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
Physical trait that I was ashamed of

581
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,160
This is growing up he was

582
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Bully

583
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
How we looked and made fun of

584
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,512
But then when it came time to rock

585
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,816
Decided to take the term

586
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
Why not make it something that

587
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
We can be proud of

588
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
Set and flip it

589
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
Something that could be cool like an

590
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Endemic

591
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
Reclaiming of a stereotype

592
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
And so

593
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,336
The idea for the science was born

594
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,616
And did you ever get pushed

595
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:52,992
Back from anyone about the name the Asian American Community love what we're doing

596
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,040
The first time I kind of Mew

597
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,856
Or was made aware that there was any kind of problem

598
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
Was with my attorney called

599
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
Me after we had worked on

600
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:03,744
The application to register

601
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
R trademark

602
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
Calls me up and it says

603
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,096
Hey Simon we got a problem

604
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
Seven-figure so I must

605
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
Dundee trademark

606
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,216
You know that paper works very confusing

607
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,008
But the attorney said no it's

608
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
It's not that

609
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,544
He says

610
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,616
The problem is that they say your name is disparaging

611
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,408
Two persons of Asian descent

612
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,688
Their name

613
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
Is considered derogatory to Asians

614
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,368
We are releasing racist to Asian people

615
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
Keep receipts

616
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,696
Stu read me section 2A of the land

617
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Something

618
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,512
You know written in the 1940s

619
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,072
Basically says you can't register trademark

620
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,400
That the government considers to be scandalous

621
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936
Immoral or disparaging

622
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,240
What was confusing to Simon

623
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,264
And to his attorney

624
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
And they looked into

625
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,592
Is that they weren't the only

626
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,616
Slants out there

627
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,968
The Trademark Office had given something like that term

628
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,784
The trademark for that term do you actually gave it out to hundreds

629
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
Of other people

630
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,088
We asked them why

631
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Why this case

632
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,904
Like why did you denied for the band

633
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,208
The trademark office is responsible space

634
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,744
Sickly hey if you go to the slant

635
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Dot-com

636
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,048
You'll see photos of Asian

637
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,584
All over the website

638
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
Was true

639
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
I was literally my face

640
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,216
Today him it seemed like wait

641
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,056
The essence of this rule is that anyone can register the slant

642
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,848
As long as they're not

643
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
Asian

644
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,896
Which seems kind of odd

645
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,688
Not to mention

646
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Potentially

647
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
A violation of his

648
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
14th Amendment

649
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,064
We haven't talked about the 14th Amendment yet

650
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
We will

651
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
That's the one that says

652
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:34,880
Everybody gets

653
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,416
Protection under the law

654
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
Here he seem to not beginning

655
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
Protection

656
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
On account

657
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
Of this rule that was

658
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
Try to prevent discrimination against Asians

659
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,936
Hangout the band starts at

660
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,472
Campaign tries to get a bunch of

661
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,312
Organizations to write it letters for them to get every single Asian-American

662
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
Newspaper in the country to write on her back

663
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
Half

664
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,664
And the trademark office

665
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Still said

666
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
No that's not good enough

667
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,040
And so they appeal they say you're violating her

668
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
14th Amendment rights

669
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,344
Our first amendment rights

670
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,904
The trademark office

671
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
Countersuit

672
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:11,488
And to make a long story short

673
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,280
The case ends up at the

674
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,304
Supreme Court

675
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
I cannot imagine being taken

676
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,120
Supreme Court so what is your

677
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
Your feeling when you find that

678
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Well

679
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
Always wanted to go

680
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,288
Was hoping it was under different circumstances

681
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,104
But at this point this is a lot bigger

682
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
Like

683
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
Knowing how long

684
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
Music groups last

685
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
This

686
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,504
Case could very well just

687
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:36,064
Continue to exist whether I had a band or not

688
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,232
So in January of 2017

689
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
Lee vs. Tam

690
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
Supremes heard the case

691
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
Thank you Mr chief justice

692
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,936
And Simon and his bandmates were right in front

693
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
What were the oral argument

694
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
Well that were arguments

695
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,104
Extremely surreal

696
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,176
Words that have other meanings in common discourse

697
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,480
Consumer

698
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,808
The intended purpose of the trademark Quattro

699
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,368
It was a room full of non-asian

700
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,416
People arguing about what was the fence

701
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Station

702
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,208
People these words

703
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
To cause controversy

704
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
Absurd

705
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
Wasn't it about

706
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
Halfway Inn

707
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Happy sweaters

708
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,032
When Justice Ginsburg

709
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
While she was questioning the government's attorney

710
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,176
When she says hey

711
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,224
Everyone

712
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
Nose

713
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,808
Ticket Clinic

714
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,600
United Way

715
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,672
But describe

716
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,488
Sting out of the word

717
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,936
Of course my heart swells and I'm like hell I think I'm in love with a Supreme Court Justice

718
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,800
Sport gern Simon goes back home doesn't really hear anything for months

719
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,592
Until

720
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
June 19th

721
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
Mm

722
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:11,040
I woke up and there were like 760 notifications on my phone

723
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,064
Indie rock band

724
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
The Slants

725
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:19,488
Will be allowed to trademark their name

726
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,024
A long time to trademark

727
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,328
And we found out that it was

728
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
Unanimous in our favor

729
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,424
And so

730
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:37,664
That is how the slant ended up doing an impromptu unplugged

731
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
Set on the steps of the

732
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,736
Supreme Court

733
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:56,352
Interestingly some people in the wake of that

734
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,912
Decision speculated that the Washington Redskins

735
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,728
Of all people would benefit from this landscape

736
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,032
Teams trademark had been denied

737
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,568
Because many Native American

738
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,104
Felt it was derogatory

739
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,408
In a couple weeks after this last victory

740
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,456
The denial of their trademark was avoided

741
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
It's so like everything

742
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,296
Supreme Court

743
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
But for our purpose

744
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:20,672
Out of the laundry list of American bands that have

745
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
Spoken out

746
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,464
Against the Federal

747
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,768
The Slants are the only ones

748
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
To our knowledge

749
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
To go to the

750
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Supreme Court

751
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
And when

752
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
Any unanimous

753
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,656
Decision

754
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
Obviously

755
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,264
When we decided we were doing this amendments album

756
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
The Slants were one of the first bands that we reached out to

757
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,592
Yasso

758
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,872
View original approach

759
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
To do the

760
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
The album and I think

761
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
Requested to write a song about

762
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,272
The First Amendment because

763
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,088
Yeah we we had such a direct experience with that

764
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
But I thought it was a little

765
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
2

766
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
Obvious

767
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
Is pressed juicery

768
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,816
And then I started thinking about the different amendments and how I always wanted

769
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
To do something around

770
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
The 18th and 21st Amendment

771
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
Which is of course prohibition 18th Amendment

772
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
Prohibition of liquor

773
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,032
And then what eventually revoked is

774
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,056
21st Amendment

775
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
Repeal of prohibition

776
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,152
Because I always just found it really fascinating

777
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
The history of round

778
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
I mean

779
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,784
The reason why prohibition didn't really work us because

780
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,368
And all of the people didn't accept it so kind of shows

781
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,416
That when you kind of stomp out certain rights

782
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
Some people feel our

783
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,256
Parent they kind of find ways around it anyway

784
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:29,536
And then

785
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,304
Hi

786
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
Thought of this idea which I shared my

787
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,960
Guitar player I said what if we use 18 and 21 with a metaphor

788
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
44 age

789
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
Because

790
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,312
When we turn 18 we assume that we

791
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,592
Have all these rights

792
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
Like you have the right to

793
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
Vote

794
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,200
You can buy cigarettes or other things we can't drink

795
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:50,016
So you actually don't have your full set of like

796
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:56,416
Adult rights until you turn 21 and so I shared that with him and my guitarist Joe

797
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
Started writing

798
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
The song

799
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
Code 1821

800
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
Which is basically

801
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:08,192
Kind of about that about growing up in and the disillusionment the loss of Innocence that's what I think

802
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:18,080
Oh man the Slants killed it I love that song it's such an Anthem

803
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,872
You can hear the whole thing

804
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:25,760
