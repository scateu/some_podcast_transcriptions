Yours Catherine

8
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,832
So maybe we can start with the

00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
The night

00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:31,232
Started start with a start the who what when where

00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
The best way to describe piano

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,888
You have a front row seat

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,424
The Greatest Show on Earth

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,960
September 17th

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,984
1998

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
On the outskirts of Houston

17
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
There's

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,688
Deputy sheriff named Joseph Quinn and he hears this

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,504
Call go out on the radio

20
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:58,880
Somebody's called in and said there's a man going crazy with a gun in an apartment

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,720
She happens to be driving right by

22
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
Apartment complex

23
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,792
Pretty familiar with the complex

24
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:12,192
I knew where the building was so he's like hey I got this I'm right here

25
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,264
I could listen and see if I hear any kind of sound to disturb

26
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,896
Walked into the breezeway

27
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,248
On high alert senses heightened adrenaline pumping

28
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
In-N-Out in the middle Courtyard

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,136
It was a gentleman standing out there

30
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
Tootsie

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,256
Xiaomi he started yelling over here over here I could tell him I was

32
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
Upset

33
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
He's up there he's up there I should have wear any points up to this apartment on the second floor

34
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,288
Is that where you're saying that apartment right there he said yeah

35
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:52,896
So a couple other officers arrived and they get information

36
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,832
You know there's a blood pressure down to where you don't get tunnel vision

37
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
Went up the stairs

38
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
Wireless

39
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,208
When I get up to the top of the stairs

40
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,768
Got to the apartment door and their door was

41
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
A jar was open

42
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
I listen for a second

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,008
I could detect anything in the apartment

44
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,568
So we got ready and I

45
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,872
Push the door open all the way open

46
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,480
Announced our presence Sheriff's Department

47
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:33,344
Anyone in the apartment come out where we can see you keep your hands in plain sight

48
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
I did just two or three times

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Very loudly

50
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
Still no response

51
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
There's a bedroom in the back of the apartment

52
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
To a back bedroom

53
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
It was closed and

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,424
These

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,824
Two officers start walking towards it

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,848
Is it open

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
As soon as he did

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
People arched back

59
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Startled

60
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,392
So go to the bedroom

61
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
You've got to be kidding me

62
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Really

63
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,656
What was it

64
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
It was

65
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Two guys have

66
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,800
Something I'll never forget I mean it's like

67
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,480
Okay so here's the story the two guys that were in the apartment where John Laurens

68
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,760
And Tyron Garner

69
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:39,136
John was an older white guy he was in his fifties and Tyrone was a younger black guy in his 30s

70
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:44,256
Come to find out basically these gentleman downstairs

71
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
Former lover on again off again lover one and he was upset that the other that the day

72
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,704
They were engaged in some kind of

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
Pics of the guy in the parking lot was the boyfriend of Tyrone and we don't really know why he

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
Call 911

75
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,784
But the thought is that maybe he was jealous of whatever was going on in the apartment and he decided he wanted to get the

76
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:14,464
So you know the cops come in and Johnny Tyrone have no idea what's going on they didn't know that

77
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
The boyfriend had gone and

78
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,303
Call nine-one-one so they're shocked

79
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,351
Quinn says they start yelling at him

80
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,887
Just I mean combative

81
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Belligerent

82
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Refusing to comply with anything

83
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:28,543
80 gauge we were homophobic we were jackbooted not

84
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
Starting point

85
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,871
Besides

86
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,735
We're leaving here in the way you're acting and they're intoxicated we're going to have further calls here

87
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
Yeah it's not again

88
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
I'm here

89
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Recite Surah Reston

90
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
Really what what

91
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415
On what charge I mean they're just in their house

92
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,439
So that's

93
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
Question

94
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
Coleman for 15 years and

95
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,631
Blessed with the ability to have someone of what you would call a photographic memory

96
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
Meaning Hindu the penal code really well

97
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
He starts

98
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,799
Thinking he starts going through all the possible laws

99
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
Could apply to this

100
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,455
Statue 2106

101
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,271
It says that members of the same sex can engage

102
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,319
It's

103
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Aloha Banning sodomy

104
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
You get sexual intercourse

105
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
Or not

106
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,999
Even treated like civilized

107
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:25,119
This is John Laurens from an interview he did with Lambda legal in 2008

108
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,167
It's one of the few bits of tape that we have

109
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,727
This is all of a sudden we're taking you downtown

110
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
I wasn't allowed to put clothes on

111
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,103
I was handcuffed and dragged downstairs

112
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:42,015
Officer Joe Quinn has a different version of that story

113
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
They refuse so

114
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
We forced them to put

115
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:50,207
Some underwear on you know we actually got him down and put underwear on them and escorted them out of the apartment like that

116
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,375
Which temperature second whatever happened in that room which cats will go in

117
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,399
Second

118
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
This moment

119
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,751
Two guys supposedly having sex and being charged with sod

120
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
It was like a strike of lightning

121
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
It would begin the process of a profoundly

122
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
Reshape America

123
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
What's interesting

124
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,343
This is one of the first things that you bumped into if you are an idiot

125
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,135
About to walk with Giants

126
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,695
And then you try to make a podcast about the law

127
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,487
Is it

128
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:29,887
There's often disconnect like laws are these things that float above us all these beautiful abstractions

129
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,471
And yet if you want to challenge LOL you got to find a person

130
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Down here in the mud

131
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,895
Pictures perfectly Sumo captures what you feel is wrong with the law you got to find a perfect plaintiff

132
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:45,503
How do you find that person and what happens if they're not so perfect

133
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:51,391
These two stories are going to hear about a particular tactic that sometimes called test case litigation

134
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951
And I wasn't too aware of before catheter

135
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,279
The Second Story actually touches on a recurrent case

136
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
We just decided a few days ago

137
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,375
Affirmative action will meet the guy

138
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
Who brought that case

139
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
The critics say is basically.

140
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,287
Throwing some of the most iconic civil rights law from the 60s

141
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,567
First

142
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,687
We get back to Katherine Wells with the story of a case called Lawrence V Texas

143
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
Oak

144
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
Come on Inn

145
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
I brought out my alarms

146
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
Vs Texas box of

147
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
Stop

148
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,487
So went to Houston and I visited a guy named Mitchell katine he's a lawyer there

149
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
And

150
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,583
He showed me the arrest papers he had the arrest paper

151
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,143
CJ Lawrence Criminal

152
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,935
Officers observed

153
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,471
The defendant engaged

154
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
In deviant sexual

155
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Conduct

156
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
Charged with homosexual conduct

157
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,151
Right there and writing I mean it's

158
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:51,551
It really is strange to see those words on a piece of paper it seems like such an anachronism but it was not

159
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,319
Has dated

160
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,879
September 17th 1998

161
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
Snow in 1998

162
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,279
Texas wasn't the only state that had this kind of law on the books

163
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
At least 13 other states also had an anti-sodomy law and it's important to note that you know this law wasn't used very

164
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:14,335
Very much people were not arrested for this law because when would police be present in your home to observe you have

165
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,383
This is Dale Carpenter

166
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
No law

167
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
SMU Law School

168
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,271
I mean sodomy laws weren't really about stopping any

169
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
Body from having sex

170
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,855
They were really about ensuring

171
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
That we could label

172
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
People Criminal

173
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
It was

174
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,999
A label that people could

175
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:32,767
2.2

176
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,863
So the people who disapproved of homosexuality could say

177
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,911
Look defining app

178
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,471
Of homosexuality

179
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:42,751
A crime

180
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Crime

181
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
Can you commit the crime

182
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,151
Well you're a criminal it's a criminal statute people can say your criminal

183
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
Which then give the state

184
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:56,319
Illegal basis to justify all sorts of housing discrimination employment discrimination

185
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
Military in every context

186
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
Statin effect

187
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,695
How many people argue that these laws

188
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,231
They also sent

189
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,583
Strong cultural message

190
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,679
The most recent example here in Houston is better described as a vicious

191
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
Killing in this was at a time when hate crimes in Houston word

192
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,663
Surprisingly, 27 years old died after being beat with a nail-studded two-by-four

193
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
2nd senseless killing in the Montrose area in less than three months is a lot of blood and was real parents

194
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
They've been shot

195
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,487
To make a long story short was very eager to repeal that sodomy law

196
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,815
Okay so John and Tyrone were arrested on a Thursday night

197
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
The next day it's so happen

198
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,143
That

199
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
Because of the location of John Lawrence as a partner

200
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,519
The case landed in a Justice of the

201
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
Peace Court meaning after Quinn made the arrest

202
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
The report was sent to that court for processing

203
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,919
Now this court is

204
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,711
Mostly deals with traffic

205
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
It's mostly a traffic court

206
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,575
But there happens to be this clerk in the court

207
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Who was

208
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
Gay and it couldn't believe that there that somebody had actually been arrested for homosexual conduct in their home

209
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,607
Is Clerk and his partner go to a bar start talking to the bartender

210
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,399
I believe it was a Friday night

211
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,983
This is William Lewis he was the bartender what I was doing

212
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Tender 90

213
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
Who is two guys come in and they tell Lane

214
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
You're not going to believe what happened

215
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
It's a couple of guys were arrested

216
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,199
And charged with the sodomy

217
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
And Linwood Lake

218
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:35,135
He just can't believe that such a thing happened it's such an unusual occurrence

219
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,159
And

220
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,487
Linford send me the report Monday morning Brighton early

221
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,815
I can hear my fax machine go off

222
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
I pulled it off

223
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Officers observed

224
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
The defendant

225
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
Engage in deviance

226
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
And

227
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
And that's when it hit me

228
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Oh

229
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,359
I mean it was so clear night and day to me

230
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
Immediately knew what I had in

231
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
What why does he care so much about

232
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
Well so when he wasn't

233
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,551
Being a bartender Lane was a community organizer

234
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,391
Tickly around LGBT issues I was present of the game has been political

235
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,975
Dukakis that's one of the oldest LGBT civil rights groups in the south

236
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,071
He been waiting for this moment how long have you been looking for a case

237
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
7/8 years

238
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
7 light years

239
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,447
Cuz just too

240
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,775
Later explicitly what why did you need I needed a test case

241
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
You can't change a law like that

242
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
If you don't have

243
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
A case

244
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,223
People in the Texas legislature have been trying to remove this law from the book

245
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:38,623
Books for years according to Dale Carpenter every time someone would introduce a proposal to repeal the law it would

246
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
Snickers and catcalls in the state legislature

247
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
It just wasn't really going anywhere

248
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:49,375
So activist who decided the only way to get this done is to bypass the legislature and go straight to the Core

249
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,215
So I need a case I had to have a someone guilty

250
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,311
Celine start trying to track them down at this point that you guys have been released from jail

251
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,407
Conversation basically went like this

252
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,759
Hi my name is Lane Lewis I'm a gay activist here in town you don't know me

253
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,087
Oh that's not important but I understand you've been arrested

254
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,135
I'm begging you not to plead out

255
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,535
Meeting don't just say you did it and pay the fine I knew I couldn't have them played out I will find you

256
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,559
Do lawyers

257
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,119
Raise the money I will pay for everything

258
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Just

259
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Don't do anything

260
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,471
Until you and I have an opportunity to me

261
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,543
She looks later they all meet at Mitchell katine xoffice

262
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
And it immediately becomes clear that these guys are sort of an Odd Couple John Lawrence at that time was

263
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,599
About he was 55 years old

264
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:47,999
Lab technician for a hospital with a young skinny black guy 24 years younger than John

265
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:54,399
I was study job from place to place and job to job no idea

266
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
What their connection was they weren't lovers

267
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
About heavy drinkers

268
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Very heavy

269
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
Both have criminal records

270
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,479
Yes Tyrone has been convicted of assault and drug possession and John have been convicted in the sixties of Murder By

271
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:12,575
Automobile yeah they were not the perfect Planet they were not the poster boy these or not

272
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Pretty tween

273
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,415
And they weren't political no not at all

274
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,695
Not at all

275
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
Weanling told John Lawrence

276
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:24,607
I'm a gay activist here in town John Lawrence didn't even know what that was I don't know what a gay activist is

277
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,959
Basically neither of them had any interest like no interest

278
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,263
And being a public figure

279
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
I gave him the whole

280
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,223
What your country can do for you ask not what you can do for your country speech I mean literally

281
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
I reminded them of who Harry hay was

282
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,719
Arguably the founder of the original LGBT movement

283
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:54,559
Ulysses may not remember but at one time it was illegal for

284
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
Certain number of a male

285
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
And the LGBT community

286
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,959
To get together in one location is illegal

287
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,287
Can do it the idea that they would be Networks

288
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,687
Of sanctuaries in places where we could come and out of which we would be able to move and organize and change things across

289
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
The country

290
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,759
So I told him a little bit about that history in

291
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,831
How far we've come and how far we had to go

292
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
And that

293
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Bad enough

294
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
How to change that

295
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
So I told him

296
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
I said

297
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
I'll be able to protect you

298
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,887
For maybe the first year or two

299
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
But there's going to come a time when

300
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
I will no longer be about you

301
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
It'll be about some

302
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Much much bigger

303
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,615
So

304
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,175
They agreed

305
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
Tyrone's attitude was okay

306
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
What do you need me to do

307
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,879
John was much more indignant

308
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
They took the wrong person

309
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
Golden song

310
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
It was a ridiculous law

311
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
But

312
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
Texas loves to keep Samantha

313
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
Quiet things around

314
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
He was mad

315
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
He was angry

316
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,495
Here's where the story gets

317
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Complicated

318
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
Because

319
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,359
At one point according to Lane Lewis

320
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,479
They were having this conversation and John was ranting you know about how he been treated and

321
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
He said you know what the worst part is we won't even

322
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,623
He wanted. He said

323
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,415
That they were not having sex

324
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,231
Wait what that they were not having sex that they were

325
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,535
Sitting in their underwear on the couch

326
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
Watching the late-night news

327
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,215
They say they were sitting there doing nothing and the cops just burst in and started pushing them around and

328
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
That they were never even having sex

329
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,823
Wave it is in this whole case about them having sex

330
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,151
Sir sing the thing that this case is supposed to be about

331
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,175
Might not be true

332
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,223
Right so I interviewed

333
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,015
Three of the four police officers

334
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,831
Joe Carpenter says when he talked to the police officer

335
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,647
He did find that their stories were sort of all over the

336
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
The place one guy said it was anal sex seesaw

337
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,767
One day later said he thought it might have been oral

338
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,815
The other two officers said they never saw anything

339
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,863
Fidel says he believes John story

340
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,911
There probably was actually no sex

341
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:13,311
You think what might have happened is that the cops walked in and saw some gaytard on the wall and some gay magazines lying around

342
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,103
Feeling that really set off the office

343
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:21,247
And they said well we know they're homosexuals they probably engaged in homosexual conduct at some point and that's illegal in Texas

344
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,855
There was no no no doubt about it I mean I have no

345
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,927
No reason to live Quinn to this day

346
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,487
Still insist that he walked in on them

347
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:37,887
Copulating he says he saw what he saw and he just did his job

348
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:41,215
That's fine I don't agree with your lifestyle but that's

349
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,519
My opinion that's what it is

350
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,103
So there's no way to know what actually happened obviously but

351
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
In a way it doesn't matter

352
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,247
Because when John said that Tulane that they weren't even having sex

353
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
Message on don't ever say that again

354
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
Don't ever say that to anybody

355
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Again

356
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
Because we could have people know that

357
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
We couldn't have people find that out

358
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,839
Is it going to go forward to this we were scared that

359
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,655
Another case would get screwed up at that point

360
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
And potentially

361
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,103
The da dropping the charges

362
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
You had to preserve the LIE

363
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
Correct correct

364
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,687
Dumb question

365
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,271
You can just do that you can just preserve a lie to keep a case going

366
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,855
Is that that's okay keep in mind it wasn't our job

367
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
2

368
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
Prove or disprove the LIE

369
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,559
The thing that mattered was not what did or didn't happen that night the thing that mattered

370
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,095
Was what the arrest report

371
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,399
Set but if what the arrest reports said

372
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
Potentially didn't happen

373
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
Should that matter

374
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Well

375
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
No no one

376
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,103
Our legal system is not designed to bring out the truth this is a misc

377
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,639
Conception does not bring out the

378
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,223
Ezio Carpenter against people who play their roles

379
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
And pursuing

380
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,551
Whatever they think their best interests are

381
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,343
That's exactly what happened

382
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:05,951
So

383
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,279
For the first few years my job was to keep the boys out of the out of the news

384
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,071
And why was that

385
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,607
Well they had a tendency to drink

386
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
And get rowdy

387
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,399
And fight

388
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:19,775
And they like to go to CD hotels and rent rooms and get really really

389
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,311
Hi drunk whatever

390
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,871
And inevitably they would start fighting with each other

391
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
And so

392
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,479
What I did what I would do without wood

393
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
I knew the difference

394
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:35,647
Places they stay busy would go to the city hotels and talk to the clerk's give him a business card tell him

395
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:38,975
If these boys come and check in they cause problems

396
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Call me first

397
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:44,351
Fan on more than one occasion that happened I'd get a call at 2 in the morning

398
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:51,007
Your guys are here they're causing trouble I'm going to have to call the cops how would jump out of bed put on my clothes cuz we couldn't have them

399
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
You know they're already on the front page of the used

400
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,871
The chronicle we could not have our defendants

401
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,687
Doing a perp walk for drugs and alcohol

402
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,015
So I would drive down there and I would figure out

403
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
Which one was causing the most problems

404
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Put them in my car

405
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
And I would drive them somewhere else I would separate them out

406
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,719
That happened more than once

407
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
More than once

408
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Celine city of the spear that

409
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,655
John and Tyrone wood would start talking to the media and let something slip

410
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
About

411
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,215
Their version of the story

412
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:26,335
So get them these little cards small little sentence basically said

413
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,127
Thank you for contacting me

414
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,199
Please refer to line Lewis and had my phone number in my ear

415
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,015
And I said so anytime the media contacts you

416
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
Don't think about what you say

417
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,111
Right that's what you get screwed up when you start

418
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,439
Thinking about what you want to say to the media pull this out of your wallet

419
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
Read it

420
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,535
Even though there were these close calls

421
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,351
As a case wound its way through the court system

422
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:50,143
Mitchell katine told me about this

423
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
One time there was this

424
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
Press conference

425
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,263
And we came outside to the normal media

426
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
Group that was out there wanting

427
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,407
Quotes and talk to us and they didn't want to hear from the lawyers they wanted to hear from the clients

428
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,687
He was like all right

429
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
Just this once

430
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:08,063
Tyrone get up to the mic and I think a reporter asked him

431
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,855
You know how do you feel about this

432
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,879
And he said

433
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
We didn't do anything wrong

434
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,487
He just kind of yelled at out and

435
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,535
Angry way we didn't do anything wrong

436
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,839
Metropolitan back and was like that's enough

437
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
That's enough next day

438
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,911
We didn't do anything wrong

439
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,215
That was the quote on the headlines of the mornings

440
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,287
Paper the next day and certainly I knew what you meant

441
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
But they weren't having sex what you know

442
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,663
Could also be interpreted as

443
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
Homosexual conduct

444
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Nothing wrong

445
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
He says luckily

446
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
That's how people took it

447
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,183
Fracking

448
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:45,951
Couple years

449
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
You're kind of how it went down

450
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:48,767
They started at this

451
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:53,631
Justice of the Peace Court they were sentenced to a fine of 125 bucks so it peels

452
00:20:53,887 --> 00:21:00,031
Send the case gets kicked up one level to the Harris County Criminal Court their find again they appeal it again

453
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:05,151
Level to the 14th court of appeals onemorelevel ultimately the Texas Criminal

454
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,687
Court of appeals which has the highest

455
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,711
Court of Texas

456
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,271
For Criminal Appeals refused even to hear the case

457
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
So the only next step is

458
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:20,512
Will hear argument next door number 02102 John Geddes Lawrence and

459
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Tyrone

460
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,072
March 26th

461
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,096
2003

462
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
Almost five years after the arrest

463
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
The case length of the Supreme Court

464
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
And by the time he gets up there

465
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,056
Mister chief justice inmates

466
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,872
The court the story is not dwelled upon at all

467
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
They didn't say

468
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,968
These guys weren't in a relationship

469
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
They didn't say

470
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,784
If these guys were having sex

471
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,088
One of them was cheating on his partner

472
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,160
Seems like they might have not been having sex anyway

473
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,256
Didn't say any of those things I said

474
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:57,376
Family relationships are established that there are hundreds of thousands of people that this is about

475
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,168
Families and relationships

476
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,472
How people in loving relationships

477
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:07,872
Have the right to express themselves and whatever they want it's none of the state's business

478
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
In the privacy of their own home

479
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,992
Performs much the same function as it doesn't show contacts

480
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:18,112
You know basically people in relationships have the right to have sex with each other regardless of their gender

481
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,648
Protected forever

482
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
The distance from

483
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
A fundamental matter

484
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
American values

485
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
Wow

486
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,656
It's like watching something float up from the sort of monkey like Realm of of human real life and then it just

487
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
It's kind of pretty rats

488
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Netflix app

489
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Yeah

490
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,032
It was such a pretty story that people words

491
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Suspicious

492
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
My people were asking

493
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,688
How did this arrest even happen this was a setup you all set this up

494
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,480
That was their big Battle Cry

495
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:47,808
Show me Tokyo teen says he heard this over and over again

496
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:52,416
But I always want to say so so what if it was does that make it any less

497
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
Have a case

498
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,488
Who cares has further questions

499
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,816
Thank you very much

500
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,656
The Honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next

501
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
3 months later

502
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:13,664
Record number 02102 Lawrence against Texas

503
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,480
Justice Kennedy begins reading a summary of His

504
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,552
The question before the court has the validity

505
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,368
Have a Texas statute

506
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,672
For two persons of the same sex

507
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,720
Intimate sex

508
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,488
Wakanda

509
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,280
Everybody's waiting for the out

510
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,816
Houston Texas

511
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,912
Super contacts it wasn't totally clear how this case was going

512
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:40,288
Come out because 17 years earlier there's been a case called

513
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
Bowers vs

514
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Does Hardwick

515
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:45,408
And then they had ruled that sodomy laws were fine

516
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,992
And I would suggest to the court that there is no constitutional

517
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:49,760
Conclusion

518
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,832
But there should be a fundamental right to engage

519
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
Homosexual sodomy

520
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,696
The Supreme Court almost never will sings order that recent

521
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,864
So Justice Kennedy starts talking about all the similarities between the cases

522
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,656
Dispatched

523
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,752
The tension starts building

524
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,104
And then finally he got

525
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,896
To the moment where he said

526
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
And it's not correct today

527
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,440
And at the point Justice Kennedy said that there were

528
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
People sobbing

529
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:46,592
Rallies Across the Nation gay rights Advocates celebrated their legal Victory a ruling so brought it surprised even many of

530
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:52,736
Court rules in favor of two Texas man who challenged a state law that made homosexual

531
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:58,112
The ruling overturned a Texas law that allowed police to arrest gays for having sex

532
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,160
12 other states have similar laws

533
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:04,768
Including a good morning John Lawrence was at home in his apartment in Houston

534
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,608
Watching the tanks

535
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,936
And all of a sudden it says has rule the law in concert

536
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,040
I came out of bed quite happy

537
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
Obviously not everybody

538
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:37,280
What's happy about it I have nothing against homosexuals

539
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:41,376
Promoting their agenda

540
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,704
Justice Scalia said basically

541
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,080
If you want this to happen that's fine but you're going about it the wrong way the court is not the place where this decision

542
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,408
Should be made you need to go talk to your fellow citizens

543
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
And convince them that this

544
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
La needs to check

545
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,296
Coming to us and asking us to bypass

546
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,624
What your fellow citizens seem to want that is

547
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
It's not how

548
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,720
What persuaded citizens

549
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,560
And imposing one's views in absence of democratic

550
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
Is something else

551
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,912
He sees this as a

552
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,728
Small minority imposing their views

553
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,008
On everybody

554
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Ebony

555
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
Said he was worried about something else

556
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,128
Today's opinion

557
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
Dismantle

558
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:28,224
The structure of constitutional law

559
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,296
That has permitted a distinction to be made

560
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
Between heterosexual

561
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
And homosexuality

562
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,696
But this decision would open the floodgates

563
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,256
And that it would only be a matter of time

564
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,792
Before the court was being asked

565
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,840
To decide on gay marriage

566
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
And he was right when Kennedy read the marriage decision in 2015

567
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
The courthouse

568
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:56,384
Private

569
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,712
Yet it does not follow the freedom

570
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
Outlaw to outcast

571
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,856
Maybe a step forward

572
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
So what happened to

573
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
Garner and Lawrence

574
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,488
Well

575
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,816
John Lawrence and Tyron Garner didn't live to see this

576
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,376
Tyrone died in 2000

577
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:19,680
N64 meningitis

578
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Had no money

579
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,288
He was 39 and his family was very poor

580
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,336
And they didn't have the money to bury

581
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,408
They didn't even have the money to reclaim his body from

582
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
County morgue

583
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:34,272
As for John Lawrence he died in 2011 at 68

584
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,832
From heart problems we didn't even find out about it

585
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
Until a month after he

586
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
It was dead

587
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,672
This hero of the gay-rights move

588
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,464
Was unknown and on

589
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
I just passed

590
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,096
What is a fair about

591
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Sort of boat

592
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,704
Practice of bringing things to the Supreme Court

593
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,336
The two people whose story this case revolves around

594
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,408
Concerta Fade Into the background afterwards

595
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:08,832
Well one is tempted I think to be very cynical in some ways because it means that

596
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:15,232
These people were useful as long as they were useful and after that they could be forgotten

597
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,792
Galaxy had that reaction a little bit I mean this is

598
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:22,400
Story of social progress but there's something a little funny at the center of it for me

599
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:28,288
We're playing this for our legal editor Italian style

600
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,360
In a lot of ways are our legal system

601
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,408
Duval's in to an end

602
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
Justifies the means

603
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
Kind of Justice

604
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:40,576
We we care we we we care about the process so much

605
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,136
And unlock the processes

606
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:48,768
Extremely important Ellie isn't this just weird to you like this is a dumb law like a dumb dumb dumb dumb law

607
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
Why not to

608
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:55,168
Should there be an Avenue to say this is a dumb law was taken away why do you have to find some people

609
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
2

610
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Didn't

611
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,728
Have

612
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
Sex they say

613
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
10 that they have

614
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:04,896
Sex then marched them up all the way through the court system and then forget about the time you just seems weird to me

615
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
Seems like a

616
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Empty theater

617
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
Why do we have to do it that way

618
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:13,088
Because if you wanted to put a ballot initiative up in 2003 in Texas saying

619
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,136
Is gay sex okay

620
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
It would fail

621
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,720
It would fail in 2003 in

622
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,536
You probably fail in 2016 in Texas

623
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
To probably fail

624
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,352
In 2032

625
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
In Texas

626
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
That's why

627
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
That's why

628
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,728
The majority isn't always right

629
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,032
So you you you you

630
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,336
Take you basically take the Democratic at

631
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,176
And this isn't this is a this goes back right to the founding of our country

632
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,224
Like when are you going to let popular will

633
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,296
Run wild and when are you going to

634
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
Constraineth

635
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
Not just restrain a constipated

636
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
You know when you going to stop it

637
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
Nn

638
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,280
Warranty Texas is a is an example of a

639
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
We just going to stop

640
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,120
And it was the right call

641
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,640
So after this Supreme Court decision did Texas immediately go and repeal the law

642
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,968
No actually the laws still on the books in Texas

643
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,528
Know the Texas legislature

644
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:20,928
Like other legislators around the country refuses to repeal the law it stays there a sort of

645
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,720
Remnant of a

646
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
Kind of a dark

647
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,560
Almost forgotten past

648
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,704
Keep in mind they can't enforce the law now that is unconstitutional

649
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,104
But they refuse to take it off

650
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,504
Coming up the very deep dive into the guy behind one of the most

651
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,904
Controversial cases this term in case that just got decided late last week

652
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:58,304
Score perfect

653
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,704
United States

654
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,592
This is more perfect I'm chat album Rod if Supreme Court cases can sometimes feel like play

655
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:48,224
Where the activist and lawyers are sort of like the directors pulling the strings in the people in the center of the case

656
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,296
The plaintiffs are just like he's in perfect actors

657
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,832
Who been cast

658
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
And the scripts are written for them

659
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
Well that dynamic

660
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
With definitely an effect this term

661
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,096
Text just last week we have had a decision just handed down

662
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:10,496
In what was billed as the landmark affirmative action case of this term

663
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,568
Impact College admissions Nationwide

664
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:19,200
The case Fisher vs University of Texas centered around the following question

665
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:21,760
Use racial preferences in college admissions

666
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:28,160
Now the University of Texas has a policy where the top 10% of every High School class automatically get in but for everybody else

667
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,000
They will consider factors like race in the question was

668
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,304
Is that okay

669
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,120
Couple days ago the court decided

670
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
Barely

671
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:44,032
But yes it is okay the Supreme Court has upheld the affirmative action program at the University of Texas

672
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,872
Affirmative action and higher education is constitutional

673
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:54,272
Now the case was brought by a young white woman named Abigail Fisher

674
00:32:54,528 --> 00:33:00,672
Erase me if hurt her chances to attend the University of Texas

675
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:05,792
Activities I was in who were being accepted into UT and the only other difference between us well

676
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,376
She was arguing that affirmative action discriminates

677
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
Against her as wipers

678
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Now

679
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,752
What you saw in the wake of that decision and even before

680
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
Eonline

681
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Warrant

682
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Hate

683
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,872
Directed

684
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:26,272
Square liter

685
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,856
Cancel did Khalid black people have it better

686
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:34,464
If you don't take your little ass on somewhere maybe if your grace didn't suck your dumbass

687
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,304
Maybe you would have gotten into a good college Becky with the bad grades

688
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
Really happy you and your racist lawyer got shot down

689
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:51,872
Because this case may have very little to do that be Fisher I mean if you look at the press conference

690
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:56,480
Treated differently based on their race is the one of the podium but behind her

691
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,760
Are in the background

692
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
You'll see the sky

693
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,392
He's there in every single press conference quarterback

694
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:08,000
At the edge of the frame not too many people know about him his name is Edward Blum

695
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
And he's the one who actually brought the case

696
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,888
When it comes to this case and so many others

697
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
He is the architect

698
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,848
He's brought dozens of lawsuits not just this one

699
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,176
And he seems to be a maestro of getting cases to the

700
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,480
Supreme Court that challenged civil rights law

701
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,088
Critics or paint messes like one-man Wrecking Crew

702
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
For civil rights

703
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:37,184
He's almost single-handedly rolling back Decades of civil rights

704
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:43,072
And when it comes to affirmative action he says he's not done just make a long story short we wanted to meet him

705
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,144
Figure out how he does

706
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,424
Went to Tallahassee

707
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,728
Border Katherine Wells takes from here

708
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,752
That's where you live

709
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,544
He Winters

710
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,568
In Tallahassee

711
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,688
You walk in what initially struck

712
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,248
Golden Retriever

713
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,784
Is what initially

714
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Struct me

715
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Literally V

716
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
Of course

717
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
And

718
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:14,304
I don't know what I was expecting but when you hear about these cases you know I mean critics are really

719
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
People are mad about the

720
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:21,472
It is deeply disturbing truly outrageous

721
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,520
So I go to meet him and

722
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
Your flight

723
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
From Austin

724
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
The Dallas

725
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
To Tallahassee uneventful and

726
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,920
On time and

727
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:33,760
Good looks like a totally nice guy

728
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,064
A regular guy

729
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,160
Like a dad there's something in me that just loves tradition

730
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
And custom you love

731
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,744
Listening to the Great American Songbook

732
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
Beautiful

733
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
Frank Sinatra

734
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,680
And

735
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,960
Ella Fitzgerald

736
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,008
I love

737
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,544
Art and Museum

738
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,080
Independent films

739
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,152
Golfer what's his what's the story with his backstory

740
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,016
Well he's 64 I was born in a small town

741
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
In

742
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
Michigan

743
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
My dad

744
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,880
On the shoe store there my mom

745
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,416
Work with him in the shoe store

746
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,720
What happen your kind of political leaning

747
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,256
Up to this point

748
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,024
I'm

749
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,840
The first Republican my mother ever met

750
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,680
How to use the word typical but it it really

751
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,752
Was a typical liberal Jewish household

752
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,544
My mother and father

753
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,336
Where Franklin Roosevelt

754
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,384
Harry Truman Democrat

755
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,176
Always

756
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,992
He said he was

757
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,296
That way to all the way through college

758
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,320
The University of

759
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,880
Grad school University of New York

760
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
Where I spent a year

761
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,952
Studying of all things

762
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,048
African literature

763
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,376
But he says somewhere along the way his political leanings

764
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,680
Started started to shift I spend

765
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
A summer in Israel

766
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Call Mom

767
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Living Mana

768
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,920
Auntie says he came out of that experience a little less liberal than he was before

769
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,344
And you got married and then in the early 80s he's living in Houston working as a stockbroker

770
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,904
And

771
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
We met

772
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
Aren't our neighbors

773
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,144
This particular couple they were New Yorkers who would move to Houston both grew up as

774
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,776
Liberals and a guy he sort of opened my eyes

775
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,824
To the world of

776
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
The Neo cons

777
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,920
The guy introduced him to these magazines weekly

778
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,504
Standard National Review commentary magazine conservative

779
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,600
And this was around the time that the neocon movement was really hitting its stride

780
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,904
Garibaldi's New York liberals

781
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Defecting

782
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Is what he says

783
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
Thousand

784
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,256
Individuals

785
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,024
To grew up in the

786
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,328
Question

787
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
The wisdom

788
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,144
Obvious liberal

789
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:58,912
Policies

790
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
And he says

791
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
Slowly slowly

792
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,008
Overtime very

793
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Gradually

794
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,056
He became one of those

795
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,992
Fast forward a little bit he's living in Houston garden-variety existence

796
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:16,832
And something happens that sends him on this entirely new

797
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,904
Basically he and his wife moved to a new neighborhood

798
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,720
They move from the suburbs into the downtown area

799
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,256
Urban and

800
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,792
In 1990

801
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,352
We went to vote

802
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,656
For the first time in our new neighborhood

803
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
I realized

804
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,288
That the Republican Party had not fielded

805
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
Candidate

806
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,128
To oppose the Democratic incumbent

807
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,408
Running for congress

808
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,688
This is a district

809
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:46,016
It has almost 600 thousand people

810
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:51,648
You don't have a choice you've only got one person running

811
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
Decided to run

812
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,976
Himself a lost item

813
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,280
No great surprise to anyone

814
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,560
He actually lost by 32

815
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
But

816
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
Along the way

817
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,656
What is something really unusual happy

818
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:09,568
During my campaign he and his wife Lark piano they decided they were going to go meet voters and their disc

819
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:15,968
They got a giant print out of all the addresses in the 18th congressional district

820
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:19,808
Call daywalking list and they just started going door-to-door meeting people

821
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:24,160
Handing out literature

822
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:24,928
Take

823
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,720
The even side of

824
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
Oak Street

825
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:32,352
And my wife would take the odd-numbered side of Oak

826
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,120
Street

827
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,424
And we would start to walk

828
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
And

829
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Reese's

830
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,776
Very quickly they realized that

831
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,800
The district

832
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
Shape

833
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Was funny

834
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,200
Some houses on one side of the street would be in the district in the house is on the other side

835
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:48,992
Sometimes the district would

836
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,552
McDonough Highway caption apartment

837
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,088
Text comeback it just

838
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,368
Didn't make sense

839
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,024
This is like Bloom wife of Edward Bloom peculiar because we had Maps we had to

840
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
Follow

841
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,816
And it was

842
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,376
Very odd the Wade some streets were

843
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,424
In the districts in somewhere

844
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,752
Took a while for it all to really sinking as to how this

845
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,568
Could happen I guess about a week of this

846
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:18,944
We realized that neighbors had been separate

847
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:24,320
Almost house by house because of their race

848
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,208
He comes to believe that the reason this was done was

849
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,768
For the explicit purpose to create a majority after

850
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536
American desk

851
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
This is an untrue

852
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:46,336
Clothes from a clear and simple wrong part of the reason this was done was the Voting Rights Act of 1960

853
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,920
Of Americans are denied

854
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:55,040
The right to vote because of their color

855
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,576
Giant

856
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Step forward in civil rights

857
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:04,256
One of the primary things that day it is eliminate barriers to voting like poll taxes and literacy tests

858
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,816
Strategies that have been used to keep minorities

859
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
And then this other thing it did

860
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:13,728
Sort of in a roundabout way through a series of interpretations is

861
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:17,824
It encouraged the creation of districts where the majority of Voters

862
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
Were minorities and that's because

863
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,176
You know one of the strategies that have been used

864
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
Use previously to

865
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:29,088
Dilute the minority was to take minority communities and

866
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,624
They called it cracking they

867
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,672
They said it split them apart and too many

868
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,976
So that they were never

869
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,048
In the majority enough to elect a representative

870
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,096
Voting Rights Act tried to

871
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
You correct that

872
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,936
18th congressional district

873
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,240
Was one of these majority-minority just

874
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
The district

875
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,312
Drawn by the text

876
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,616
But you have a slight

877
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
African American majority

878
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
I think about 51%

879
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,271
But this was the problem according to bloom

880
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,807
The way they got to that

881
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:05,183
African American majority was bite creating this District that's zigzagged all over the city and cut through neighborhood

882
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,231
I could not understand

883
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
People live close to

884
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:14,911
Together they sent their kids to the neighborhood schools they shopped in the neighborhood shopping centers they were worried about

885
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,447
Neighborhood issues

886
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
Brixies neighborhoods

887
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
Depart by race

888
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,311
Seemed

889
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,847
So wrong

890
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,639
In his mind

891
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,943
This law was actually

892
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,271
Not limiting discrimination but actually perpetuating

893
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:37,951
I don't know what the average person upon realizing this would have done but

894
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,231
I decided

895
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,279
File a lawsuit

896
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,119
Decided to sue the state of Texas

897
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,911
Called a few friends

898
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
Who lived in the 18th District

899
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:53,055
And a few other districts in Texas African American Hispanic

900
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
Looking and looking and looking until I found a lawyer that I can afford $7,000 a month

901
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:03,295
Filed lawsuit challenging the constitutionality Texas's

902
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
Rediske

903
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:08,159
Play the recent charged with yes the Voting Rights Act was good in its day

904
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:13,535
But now it was being used as this excuse to segregate people into racially polarized District

905
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,119
Worked its way through the lower courts and

906
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
Am I

907
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Shock

908
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,447
And surprise

909
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,751
In 1995

910
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:29,407
Number 94805 George W bush vs Alvera of the Supreme Court

911
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:36,063
You went to the oral argument

912
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Our opponents

913
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,671
Step to the left turning

914
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
Pele

915
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,511
The constitutionality of three congressional districts

916
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
They make

917
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:50,911
Their arguments

918
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Y'all we have to put

919
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,471
People together by race

920
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,287
The Texas legislature has the obligation

921
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,895
To satisfy Federal requirements in a federal requirement

922
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:04,991
Like remember the Voting Rights Act we're trying to make sure that there are enough minorities in this

923
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
District

924
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,575
So that they have a chance to elect a representative

925
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,647
Then our advocate

926
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,207
Made his arguments

927
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,767
That was just being made

928
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,047
Basically said

929
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
But look at the map

930
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,607
The map is

931
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,887
Bizarre

932
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,935
And the only reason

933
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,215
It could have gotten this way as

934
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Because you're only thinking about race

935
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
Only race

936
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:33,151
Think about it that seems messed up isn't that messed up it doesn't matter what your ultimate goal is

937
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,431
You cannot use

938
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:40,831
Forbidden tools rate is forbidden by the 14th Amendment to be used as a tool

939
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:47,231
A very tense situation

940
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:05,663
Let me explain

941
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,711
So in the end

942
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:12,831
Supreme Court

943
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,879
Hair-splitting decision

944
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,951
But I think it's at this deeper question that

945
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,767
In our society

946
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,839
Discourse we just haven't figured out how to talk about anyway

947
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:27,423
You don't look if you're defining race

948
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,471
Just the color of someone's skin

949
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:35,871
The government cannot use that in any way that's against the constitution on the other hand if you take

950
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:42,271
Take this wider View and you look at race in the context of History social context

951
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:47,135
How can the government address discrimination without taking race into account do they have to

952
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,183
So it's just typical balance

953
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,463
You can't look at race

954
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,231
But you have to look

955
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:51,999
Grace

956
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
And

957
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,583
The Supreme Court says to Texas look

958
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,423
All you're doing in this case is sorting People based on how they're labeled on a saint

959
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:04,543
You're not looking at that wider context you're not looking at if these communities with next to each other

960
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,823
Fisher common interest

961
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,615
You're just sorting them based on

962
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,919
Race alone and that's not good enough

963
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,943
You can't do that

964
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,711
When the

965
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,503
Opinion came down

966
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
The Supreme Court ruled in our favor

967
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,831
For 5 to 4

968
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,367
That was

969
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
Quite

970
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,671
A day

971
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,231
The day that we won that lawsuit

972
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:28,095
I was

973
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
String

974
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Hooked

975
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,191
Forever

976
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:38,591
Edward Bloom decided that this would be his face became the court to try to strike down

977
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:44,991
Every race-based policy he could legal team was taken on the road I recruit

978
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
Plaintiffs in New York

979
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:53,183
Virginia South Carolina to challenge congressional district plans and we won

980
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,719
In each of those States

981
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:01,119
He helps to school districts in Florida and Texas and the use of racial quotas in case through 12

982
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:07,519
Magnet schools even after affirmative action in Houston city Contracting

983
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:13,919
Affirmative action

984
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,711
Six of which

985
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
Made it to the Supreme Court

986
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,807
Including

987
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,903
In 2013 in a five to four vote

988
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,999
Ford very divided Florida Supreme Court today

989
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:34,143
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 Supreme Court struck down a very important part of the Voting Rights

990
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:40,543
Becky 1965 Landmark lock is considered one of the most important pieces of civil rights

991
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,895
Legislation ever passed Shelby County vs holder this decision

992
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
Gutted the Voting Rights Act

993
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,503
Specifically there was as part of it that said

994
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,807
States and counties with a history of discrimination

995
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,111
How to check with the federal government first

996
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:58,207
Before they go about changing their voting laws basically the federal government was saying look

997
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,999
You've been up to all this stuff work

998
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Now we're watching

999
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,559
Supreme Court said

1000
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
You know

1001
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,863
Time for change

1002
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,191
That list was made a long time ago and

1003
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
It's outdated

1004
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,751
This decision

1005
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:15,871
Restores an important constitutional order to our system of government

1006
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
This was blooms

1007
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Fidget spinner

1008
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,455
When Shelby County k

1009
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,831
I think a lot of people burst into tears when I came down

1010
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
Yeah

1011
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,183
I understand it is deeply disturbing

1012
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
Deeply disappointed

1013
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,743
Deeply disappointed

1014
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,511
With a court

1015
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:37,631
Decision in this matter

1016
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,447
Change during the Civil Rights Movement

1017
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,751
People died for the precious right to vote

1018
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,567
This is congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston tech

1019
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:51,967
I would like to have the Supreme Court Justices go back in time

1020
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:57,855
Second time and March with those who marched after Bloody Sunday

1021
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,391
From Selma to Montgomery

1022
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,695
A balloon has a right to his opinion

1023
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,023
It doesn't mean that it has to be the opinion of the United States

1024
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,815
I understand that

1025
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,607
People were in

1026
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,399
Gravely upset

1027
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,471
I also know that there were people who were greatly relieved

1028
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,263
And Gravely

1029
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,055
Ratify

1030
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,847
Yeah but I think what gets a lot of

1031
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
People

1032
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,639
Is it

1033
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,199
You look at the Civil Rights videos you see tens

1034
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:23,967
1000

1035
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,271
40 thousand people in the streets March

1036
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:31,903
And you hold that and if you make a split screen in your mind you hold that thousand ten thousand people in one side

1037
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,183
On the other side

1038
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,975
You one guy

1039
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,791
It does make you ask basic questions about tomorrow

1040
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
That's a false

1041
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,375
It's

1042
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,703
That maybe your split screen but that's

1043
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Really not

1044
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,567
Good luck in nineteen

1045
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
5419

1046
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,151
America

1047
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,175
Was

1048
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
Held hostage

1049
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
Bye

1050
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,271
The legacies of slavery

1051
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,039
And

1052
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,575
The chokehold

1053
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,855
Jim

1054
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,623
Crow

1055
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
Fast

1056
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,927
Forward

1057
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
2

1058
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,231
2006

1059
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,023
The reauthorization

1060
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
Of

1061
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
The voting right

1062
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,863
The chokehold

1063
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Gone

1064
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,423
Away

1065
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,471
African Americans

1066
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,495
In the Deep South

1067
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,031
Registered to vote

1068
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,823
In numbers

1069
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,615
Often exceeded

1070
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,431
Participated in elections

1071
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,223
In numbers that

1072
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,247
Exceeded why

1073
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,295
In terms of

1074
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,343
Electoral opportunities

1075
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,879
We have

1076
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
Come

1077
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,951
180 degrees

1078
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:38,975
From

1079
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:45,631
1960s degrees because of the law which you helped overturn an instant we don't know

1080
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:49,727
YouTube what degree that is the psychology of America changing or the fact that we had a law that

1081
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,519
Cat people online

1082
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,799
And now that love has gone

1083
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:59,199
And now we see voter ID laws coming back into play which I think any like sane person would admit is it is it is

1084
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,503
Is it is an attempt a blatant attempt to disenfranchise

1085
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:06,111
Just people so it feels a little bit strange that two I mean I completely agree with your things have gotten better

1086
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
Same time I think

1087
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:10,463
Well that was because of the law that's now gone

1088
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,255
Look laws

1089
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,303
Change laws

1090
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,327
Evolve

1091
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,631
+ and at some point

1092
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,935
They need to come to an end

1093
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
Okay

1094
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,199
So just to jump back in

1095
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:35,039
Something we haven't actually talked about yet is

1096
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,879
Original question how how does this actually happened how does it work

1097
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,927
How is one person

1098
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:47,071
Able to be so effective to do this work if you need a computer a printer

1099
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,095
A cell phone

1100
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,423
Really about it

1101
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
Play who pays for the lawyer fees

1102
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:58,079
Who do you go to individuals that know of my work

1103
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,871
There are foundations

1104
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:04,735
Okay so he's a 501 c 3 like the NAACP and Lambda legal that funded

1105
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,503
Lawrenceville

1106
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,271
The Texas case

1107
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:12,159
And if you're a 501 c 3 public charity as he has you don't have to reveal your donors to the

1108
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,743
We do know a couple of his donors though and they're

1109
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,535
Wealthy very conservative

1110
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,839
So in the end what he does

1111
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
Is 2

1112
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,375
Just sort of a

1113
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,655
More

1114
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:27,519
Maybe a more strategic or sophisticated version of what Lane Lewis did in the first story

1115
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:28,799
Like

1116
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,847
In this case that he just lost last week

1117
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,919
He wanted to challenge affirmative action so

1118
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:36,479
The first thing you did was sort of do a casting

1119
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,295
He said to find the perfect White

1120
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:45,695
Set up a website called UT not fair. Org

1121
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:51,071
Race as a factor in the admissions policy pretty budget it's just him looking at the camera

1122
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,143
In front of a poster that says UT not fair

1123
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:57,215
All high school students have been rejected from UT

1124
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
To visit

1125
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
At

1126
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,311
UT not fair. Org

1127
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,847
Tell us your story

1128
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,151
And then he started talking to the people who responded

1129
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,431
I think I ended up

1130
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,479
170

1131
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,271
5 responses

1132
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,343
Of those about a hundred were

1133
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,367
Viable

1134
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:16,415
With a 75 you throughout just fly

1135
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:21,279
Oakland teacher didn't think they would be

1136
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Sympathetic

1137
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:28,959
Whittled the hundred down to seven that he thought would be sympathetic 7 or 2

1138
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
Did not

1139
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,543
Really want to go forward like I don't want that

1140
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,079
Attention they were fearful

1141
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,871
The backlash

1142
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:36,895
Anyway

1143
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:41,759
To make a long story short he ended up finding Abby Fisher because a friend of his called and said

1144
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,295
Hey my daughter just got

1145
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,319
Rejected from UT

1146
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
I heard you were look

1147
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,647
I think I'm a very

1148
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:51,999
Like a very like introverted person so I feel

1149
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:55,583
Like sometimes is a lot of pressure

1150
00:53:56,607 --> 00:54:01,727
I think it's in the end it's totally worth it and and to be able to tap a voice

1151
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:06,079
In this into know that my voice is making a difference is really rewarding

1152
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,871
She seemed like the perfect planet

1153
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,663
Strawberry blonde hair

1154
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,735
She's kind of shy in front of the camera in a good way

1155
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,271
But last week

1156
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
They lost

1157
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:22,719
Sweet talk to him before all this happened so we weren't able to get a reaction from him but he did tell an Austin news

1158
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,743
Paper that

1159
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,559
The night after the decision came down

1160
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,863
He had three glasses of wine

1161
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,143
He took an Ambien

1162
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,447
Any thought about these particular lyrics

1163
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,983
In a Billy Joel song

1164
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,383
The song called Keeping the Faith

1165
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,663
I'm a long day

1166
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
Runner

1167
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:47,039
If there's something just emblematic about my personality

1168
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,575
I run

1169
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,599
Long distance

1170
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,135
He says he's definitely

1171
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:51,903
Not done

1172
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,695
He's actually already has

1173
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,975
Two more cases against

1174
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,255
Affirmative action in the works

1175
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:59,583
I have retained counsel to litigate

1176
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,863
Harvard admissions

1177
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,631
Policies in

1178
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,167
University of North Carolina

1179
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:03,935
Admission

1180
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:08,031
I'm am sorry to just doesn't strike anyone I mean forget the politics whether you're on

1181
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
On Lux aeterna.

1182
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,103
The tactic doesn't strike anyone is like

1183
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,383
Fishy

1184
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,943
I resist giving Ed Bloom that much credit

1185
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,223
Ethel MS Dollar General

1186
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,247
Gladiator

1187
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,271
I would say

1188
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,575
What the fundamentally he's just implementing

1189
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,879
A strategy that was perfected

1190
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,951
By the people he now ironically seeks to disenfranchise

1191
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,767
I'm this is civil rights movement 101

1192
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,303
He's got laws if he doesn't like

1193
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,095
That he knows he

1194
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
You can't overturn

1195
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
Through an election

1196
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,959
What was the failed Congressional

1197
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,031
He had that Lust For for political power

1198
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:43,103
Couldn't get it through the electoral system but he found this other way

1199
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,919
I'm to do it this is exactly what this

1200
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,991
Okay so me and this is one of the most

1201
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,271
Fascinating

1202
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,295
Things about the

1203
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,063
Story

1204
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:57,183
If we go back to remember this case there's a famous case called Plessy versus Ferguson

1205
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:01,279
Sir no not really a good example

1206
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,655
This is Susan Carr law professor at American University Washington

1207
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,679
10 College of Law

1208
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:11,775
Plessy versus Ferguson 1892 that was a case

1209
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:16,127
Where are the state of Louisiana

1210
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
La witch

1211
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,687
Said that people of color

1212
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,503
And white people could not ride in the same train cars

1213
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,807
If you heard the story

1214
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,575
This is how it goes

1215
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:30,975
Somebody named Homer Plessy black man sits down in a white car he is arrested and decides to sue

1216
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,511
Annie's case goes all the way to the surf

1217
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,327
The thing about that case

1218
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,631
Is that it was a total setup

1219
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167
Flaming

1220
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:45,823
So we go back when Louisiana passed that law requiring separate cars early civil rights groups were obvious

1221
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,615
Horrified by this but

1222
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,895
The railroad tie

1223
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,919
Companies were actually

1224
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:54,015
Mad about this too because they thought it would be much more expensive to run the trains

1225
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:58,879
If they had to have add additional training so they have white cars in Cars of color

1226
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,183
And so rights activist

1227
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,231
Companies

1228
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,791
They recruited somebody named Homer Plessy

1229
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,815
Who was

1230
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,839
7/8

1231
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,631
White 1/8 Africa

1232
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:13,215
And they sent him to go sit in a white car

1233
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,519
On a train that he got into a

1234
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,311
First class

1235
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,335
People's car

1236
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:22,175
And they sent somebody to go arrest him

1237
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:26,271
Got a off duty police officers

1238
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:30,111
You could do that at the time that you can hire a private detective to make

1239
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:30,879
Pinterest

1240
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,439
And today they hired that person to

1241
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
So

1242
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,511
Plus he gets onto the train

1243
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,839
The conductor comes by and plessis Lake

1244
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,655
Just thought I should let you know I'm actually in a black

1245
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:46,239
And the conductor says well in that case you're going to need to be on the other

1246
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,799
Car in the strain the Homer Plessy says

1247
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,615
I'm good actually I I'm going to be staying right here

1248
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:57,759
And the conductor says that you have to move and Homer Plessy you says no really not going to

1249
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:02,879
Things get heated and eventually this detective that they've hired comes in and wrestling

1250
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:07,487
And they brought a lawsuit

1251
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,047
That's amazing the whole thing is cooked starting with

1252
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:15,167
The arrest challenge the separate cars law and they were able to get it up to the US Supreme Court

1253
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,447
And they were hoping

1254
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,775
That they would be able to establish that

1255
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,335
The idea of separating the races with uncut

1256
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,103
Sensational

1257
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,895
But unfortunately they miss

1258
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,455
Calculated in the Court ruled that the law

1259
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,735
Was Kant

1260
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,039
And what they got instead was

1261
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
Separate but equal

1262
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,599
Totally backfired

1263
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
But

1264
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,975
It was this early example of this other way

1265
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,255
You know if you can

1266
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,071
Find a plaintiff for create a plaintiff

1267
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:47,423
You might be able to bypass the legislature and go to the Supreme Court instead

1268
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,727
The n-double-acp later picked up on this

1269
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,263
Today weather true

1270
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,543
Geniuses

1271
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:58,943
They perfected it and they perfected it under circumstances where victories were highly unlikely

1272
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,343
Play example in the early 1900s they do things like send a black guy and a white guy all over New York City

1273
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,879
Segregated theaters

1274
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:11,999
And see if one of them was prevented from being seated

1275
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,279
And if they were

1276
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:15,327
They would sue those theaters

1277
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:22,495
And when victories that way then there was this other law in Louisville Kentucky that said nobody

1278
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,775
I could buy a house

1279
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:29,663
Or live on a block in with white people lives if they were African American

1280
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:36,063
So they recruited a white guy to sell a house to a black guy and then they had the black guy refused to take the house so the white guy could say

1281
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,647
You said you would buy the house but

1282
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:46,047
I'm not buying the house because I can't live there white guys who's the black guy that was a manufactured case

1283
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,351
It was one of the NAACP

1284
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,631
First victory

1285
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:54,495
And that's the case we're just as Homestead and it said that he ended up not publishing

1286
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,799
Hey wait a minute this isn't even a real case

1287
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,895
What's the time

1288
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:05,503
Anything that involves manufacturing a case or fomenting litigation

1289
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,039
All of those things were

1290
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:07,807
Illegal

1291
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,855
It's not just unethical but actually illegal

1292
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623
Yes

1293
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,903
Criminally illegal

1294
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,951
Sienna's

1295
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:20,351
Something like that we see ambulance-chasing today the lawyers for the n-double-acp were very aware of AC

1296
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,911
And this came to a head in the 19th

1297
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,215
Britton The Voice EP

1298
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:28,287
Wanted to get the court to end segregated

1299
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,335
Basically they wanted to overturn

1300
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,359
Plessy versus Ferguson

1301
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,919
And the way they were doing this

1302
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:37,759
You know they needed the plaintiff so the way they were looking for plaintiffs is going to

1303
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:39,807
Meetings with parents and sort of

1304
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,391
Quietly you know subtly trying to ask

1305
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,183
Parents if they wanted to

1306
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
To be the face

1307
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:49,023
SOB's cases Virginia knew that they were doing this

1308
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,327
And they tightened up these regulation

1309
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,119
Since it said you know you can't

1310
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,143
Drum up litigation

1311
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,191
To try to stop them from doing this

1312
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,751
So the n-double-acp sued

1313
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,055
And they took this issue all the way to the Supreme

1314
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,591
Test litigation

1315
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,383
Is essential because

1316
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:07,711
No matter how it legal it is public officials

1317
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,063
Annette case the Supreme Court said

1318
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,855
Actually

1319
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,671
Manufacturing litigation is

1320
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,951
Is a form of political

1321
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,719
Expression

1322
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Really

1323
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:23,071
And it is totally okay like free speech basically

1324
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,887
It's a way of expressing your political view

1325
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,727
And test case litigation exploded after

1326
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,799
Play the 60s and 70s a lot of other movie

1327
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,639
The women's movement Poor People's movement

1328
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:40,479
Saw the success of civil rights movement was having with the strategy

1329
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,063
And now I guess I'd include that blue

1330
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,343
The founding

1331
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,111
Principles

1332
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,903
Of the Civil Rights Movement

1333
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,439
Have been embraced

1334
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,487
By the vast majority of

1335
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,303
Those founding principle

1336
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,351
Those founding principle

1337
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,655
Guide

1338
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,679
These losses

1339
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,215
That

1340
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
Basic

1341
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,007
Fundamental

1342
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,031
Guiding principle

1343
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,079
The Civil Rights

1344
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,127
And how it needs to be applied to

1345
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,663
Today I am.

1346
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,991
I can't say what I think of that on family time Family Radio

1347
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,319
That that is that is not that is an actor

1348
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,855
Epsom is not

1349
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,647
Carrying the standard

1350
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,439
Forward for civil rights in America

1351
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,023
Bailey says he is actually doing something good

1352
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:30,399
Deeply important to our political system a lot of people who

1353
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
Who agree with

1354
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,447
Adblue

1355
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,543
There they agreed with him in a way that couldn't be expressed in the polls

1356
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:38,591
They're out there

1357
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:44,735
I'm this is one way for that and that happens I think again that's at the another call back to the Silver Rights with

1358
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,271
When you have a minority

1359
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
The leaves in summer

1360
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,855
They just get trampled

1361
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,647
In popular election

1362
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,415
Okay

1363
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,231
But do they still have a voice should they still have

1364
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,767
Should people have a way

1365
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,071
I'm to not change on their behalf

1366
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,607
/ the will of the majority

1367
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,911
Seems to me

1368
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,215
Textbook what courts are supposed to be able to do

1369
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,031
To look out the rights of minorities political

1370
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,591
I'm more than head of Africa racial religious

1371
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:14,687
And see that they are not being trampled by a majoritarian attorney

1372
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:19,807
A bloom is helping a minority of people who believe what he believed

1373
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,879
Yeah I'm so not prepared for you saying any of this

1374
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:30,047
This is really surprising to me
