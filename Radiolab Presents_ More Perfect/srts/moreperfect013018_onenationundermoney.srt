00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,888
WNYC Studios

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,688
Hey I'm Jared I'm around this is more perfect

3
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,016
Final episode of season 2 long-overdue

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,832
Today I'm going to fulfill a promise that I made to myself

5
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:26,624
At the very beginning

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648
Of more perfect

7
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
Several years ago

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,512
I started to show it was out of a very

9
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
Basic

10
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,168
Desire to understand some things that I knew nothing about people talk about something I knew nothing about

11
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:43,008
In one of the very first questions it I bumped into

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
As a supreme court idiot

13
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
Was it why does everybody keep talking about this thing called Commerce Clause

14
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
What was the Commerce Clause what the hell is it

15
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:02,208
Section 8 Clause 3 of The Constitution 16 words

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,536
Two commas Congress shall have the power to regulate

17
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,840
Commerce with foreign Nations

18
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:12,448
And among the several States and with the Indian tribes power to regulate commerce

19
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
The four nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes there are no more sexier words in the English language

20
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,920
Better words for when we're never written

21
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,016
That's Jamie Floyd Norris viski will meet them properly and second okay so

22
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:30,880
Pictures of the definition isn't that hard it's written right there in the Constitution those 16 words

23
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:35,488
Have something to do with Commerce going across state lines fine but

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,304
When you start to stare at those were

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,376
Really track how they've been read across time

26
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,448
You realize that within that she'll of boring

27
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,496
Is a cosmic power

28
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
Like for me

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,944
The experience I had learning by the Commerce Clause was a little bit like watching the X-Men movies

30
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
Initially it was like my name is Magneto why is Magneto the head of the bad guys

31
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
Was why are they follow him he has the most boring power can control metal

32
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
You can shift into any shape she wants storm can control lightning

33
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:17,216
Initially has power seem like you have the worst one

34
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
But then

35
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
You see these seats were he's like being attacked by a thousand policemen and he just kind of

36
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
Mixed are bullets freeze in midair for a pics of a whole Bridge with lights

37
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:40,256
Pointing at it and then hit you up

38
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072
He has the best power

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,984
Because the whole world is made of metal she can control the world

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,384
If we build the world a different way baby not but

41
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,736
This world is just say I'm Frankenstein's monster

42
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
Today

43
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,368
I tell you the story of that monster

44
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,952
Story

45
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:13,024
That contains everything we fight about is Americans

46
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,888
States rights civil rights equal rights race big government small government all of it

47
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
Wrapped up in those 16 words

48
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
Two commas

49
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,432
Supreme Court of the United States

50
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256
Supreme Court of the United States

51
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,864
United States

52
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,344
All right

53
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
Do you even explain why

54
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
Something like the Commerce Clause exists

55
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,351
Split a dollar bill issued by

56
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,631
A central bank

57
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,703
Are you looking at dollar bill right now

58
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,751
Federal Reserve Note United States of America

59
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,359
That is James Chen professor of law at Michigan State University now the

60
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,479
Sing about a dollar bill the awesome obvious thing is that you can

61
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,783
Take that dollar bill and buy

62
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599
Some Sour Patch Kids or whatever dollar buys these days

63
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
Anywhere in America

64
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,023
But in the late 18th century backed all the way through to the 20th century

65
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,119
Wasn't like that no no no no no all the states have their own Banks

66
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519
And their own bills different sizes colors example there's a moment when South Carolina has is pretty little green South

67
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,823
South Carolina Bill same time Rhode Island

68
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
SF Giants

69
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Pink

70
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,991
Square thing and if you are a South Carolinian in Rhode Island trying to buy some

71
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,903
Carrots and potatoes let's say you hand them your South Carolina bill

72
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,231
Well the Rhode Islanders would look at that and say why don't know what this is

73
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,583
Who's the trust this bank right and so they would discount

74
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
No

75
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:30,495
Based on the distance from their own home they would discount the note based on

76
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,055
How it looks how professionally drawn up it was

77
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
They might look at that $10 and say

78
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,919
That's only worth 8 to me

79
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Felidae

80
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
Horrible way to do business

81
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,295
Socks for the person holding the note right

82
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:48,159
So what the government decided to do is to say 8 words can use one bill

83
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
Swindell

84
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
To be so much easier

85
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,535
This is one of the ways God was going to pull all these

86
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
Different states

87
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
Together they're going to regulate the currency

88
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,935
And not just the currency itself they were going to regulate

89
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,959
The flow

90
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Of that kind

91
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,567
And this is where the Commerce Clause comes in

92
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
This is Jamie Floyd

93
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
Journalist

94
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,063
Host of all things considered here I come

95
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,647
It's early in the Republican Howard 1820s

96
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,719
Now just to hit pause for 1 second to the Commerce Clause with

97
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:28,607
The pre-existing thing in the US Constitution

98
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:34,495
Thought about her or where where is it in the minds of people a day to nowhere

99
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:38,847
No we're not other people

100
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:46,015
She says 1824 to Steamboat operators get into a thing it's a business going back and forth

101
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:51,135
Newark New Jersey the East think they should be the only one allowed to do that and it makes its way as we say

102
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,719
All the way to the US Supreme Court

103
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:00,607
And who's sitting up there with a big bad dude named John Marshall

104
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:07,263
Marshall is the sort of Rambo

105
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
Of the course

106
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,895
He look at those 16 word Congress shall have the power to regulate

107
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:19,295
Commerce with foreign Nations and among the several states he looks at those 16 words and a couple of, xandy.

108
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
Pretty much for the first time

109
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,159
Did those words give Congress the power

110
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
To regulate

111
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
Commerce

112
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
Between and among states

113
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,559
This boat is going from one state to the other

114
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
The only way to resolve that

115
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,911
Is for the federal government to come in

116
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
And controller

117
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,543
Again the idea is it this is the only way for the country

118
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,359
To function as a unified thing

119
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,967
John Marshall's decision he says

120
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
You look we have United States of America

121
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
We don't have a divided States of America or independent States of America or New Jersey in

122
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
New York existing

123
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,047
Separately we decided to organize

124
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
As a United States

125
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
And so what

126
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
John Marshall says it's because of that

127
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:14,079
There has to be a power to regulate trade between those days in amongst those days when there are dispute

128
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,175
Otherwise it's all going to fall apart

129
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,367
He was at that point that the Commerce Clause

130
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,415
Gant glow

131
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
Womb very faintly

132
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,375
For the next hundred years the government experiment with the Commerce Clause in cases involving

133
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:41,983
Trade with Native American tribes or navigation but if you want to talk about power

134
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
The real power

135
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
Of the Commerce Clause got Unleashed

136
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
1941

137
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
In a wheat field

138
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,623
My father was a farmer I'd like to say all of his life

139
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:04,767
Pride in the fact that he never he never work for another man he would tell me that yourself

140
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,839
Well my name is the same as my father at

141
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,143
Roscoe Curtis filbrun

142
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
I'm a junior Roscoe film

143
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:18,591
Bird the time he was a fifth generation farmer in Montgomery Ohio

144
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:24,479
Our farm was just right next to Dayton Ohio Roscoe

145
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
Is about 40 year old man

146
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:30,111
At this point we're talking about 1941-42 good looking

147
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
Sturdy

148
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:37,023
Fiercely independent I never worked for another man in my life

149
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,423
Apparently that was his motto he would tell me that many times over the years if you had to put like Captain

150
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,215
In America with a pitchfork

151
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
This is

152
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,199
So Roscoe's got this far more than a hundred cows on it he would male cows until both of these are

153
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,807
Farms went practically no catch chickens 2000s

154
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:06,207
And a we had a very big Garden he would plant things you know light string beans lima beans

155
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:12,607
Sweet corn potato carrots radishes different kinds of apples

156
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:19,007
Trees are strawberries and raspberries

157
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
And of course

158
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
Sweet sweet

159
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,431
Okay set up out of the way here's what happened

160
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,735
It's 1941

161
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
Roscoe

162
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,111
Senior my dad was out in the field I think on his tractor

163
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,207
That day he was plowing the weed or something and

164
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,303
Apparently must have been some guy

165
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
From the

166
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,191
Department of Agriculture Local 8

167
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,543
I guess going around to various farmers in our community

168
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:58,175
Wanting the farmers to answer several pages I think of questions

169
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:03,807
And this particular date this government gentleman came out into the field

170
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
He looked around

171
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
And he said Roscoe

172
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,743
Oceans you got 22 Acres of wheat

173
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Lesoir

174
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
You're over

175
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:14,815
Your quota

176
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,655
He was 11.1 Acres over what was permitted

177
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,959
And so the guy tells him he have to pay a fine

178
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,543
A really big fine

179
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:32,735
My dad looked over and he was just as sober as a judge in a courtroom on a murder case

180
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,343
And what happened next would change the country forever

181
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,415
In ways that we are still literally living with

182
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,719
But Mitch's Surf fill in the gaps here

183
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,047
Tell you what you need to know about why they're they were even having this conversation

184
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:54,239
And to help me with that my name is Ari savitski and I'm an attorney friend of the show man of law

185
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,895
An important thing to understand is that you know when our story starts with Roscoe filburn agriculture

186
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:07,295
Pictures of huge Returns the economy the Great Depression is happening abundant

187
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:13,695
And the Dust Bowl 1930s

188
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:20,095
And so you have a lot of people who rely on selling crops and buying crops and so wheat prices to matter of life

189
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,959
Millions of Americans asking for action

190
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:31,359
Ionic from now till 1938 Congress enact

191
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:37,759
What's called the agricultural adjustment act to reboot the economy so the 1938

192
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,343
Cultural adjustment act got the federal government into the business

193
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
Regulating

194
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:49,023
Busy with the government did was they said to the farmers America we are going to give you essentially alone we're going to

195
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,607
Guarantee you a certain minimum price

196
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,215
We're going to give you X number of dollars per bushel or whatever it is

197
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,775
That will help lift you out of poverty

198
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,567
In exchange for that

199
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
You have to

200
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,615
Promises

201
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,431
To only grow a certain amount

202
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,991
It's in the big fear was that they grew too much

203
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
There be the

204
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,599
Flood of Supply on the wheat market prices would crash

205
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
And that would be bad for everyone you know we is sort of a collective action problem right everyone's going to sell as much weed as they can

206
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
But that means prices go down and everyone makes less

207
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,583
So with the government

208
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,215
Decide to do in addition to giving out loans is that they placed a cap on how much wheat a person could grow

209
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
So quote a straight-up quota

210
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,663
That way you ensure the supply of wheat is steady and you ensured that that the prices don't cry

211
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:42,783
And whole reason the government could do this regulate the entire wheat Market

212
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:46,623
What's by hendricken on the Commerce Clause has 16 words

213
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,647
Basically said

214
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:53,791
That when something like wheat is bought and sold and moved from one place to another one state to another cross state lines

215
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,887
Well that's Interstate Commerce and that's something that Congress can regulate

216
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,823
So my father having the back to Roscoe filburn without inspector

217
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
On his farm

218
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
Spectra says

219
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:14,527
Look Roscoe you've grown too much weed my dad looked over and he was just as sober as a judge in a courtroom

220
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Romano murder case

221
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:22,207
And what do you think he says back he says wait a minute I'm going to show you exactly how I feel about that

222
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:22,975
No

223
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:29,375
That's how I feel know you government might have been a family guy she says I don't get it

224
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,959
I'm not I'm not have nothing to do with interstate commerce

225
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
And

226
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
This is the key

227
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
Explain to the inspector that yes

228
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:46,527
According to the government quota I'm only supposed to grow about 11 acres a week and I am growing 23

229
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
But then extra 12

230
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,623
I'm not selling it to anybody

231
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,903
He doesn't sell the Wii

232
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
He doesn't trade the way

233
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,791
What's he doing with this week he uses all the wheat to feed his animals

234
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,351
Feeding it to the farm animals the weight

235
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,935
He said the sum of the week to the stairs I

236
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,335
I was just keeping it on the farm well yeah so it's in a completely internal Operation Ivy

237
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,735
I mean I feel like the poor guy gets kind of dragged into a national case

238
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:21,599
Who was interstate commerce to feed my cows I'm on my phone I'm doing my business

239
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,671
Big Brother leave me alone but

240
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Big brother does not leave me alone

241
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,999
The inspector

242
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,815
Says we're the government that's the law

243
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,095
Please uphold it

244
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,375
Pay

245
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
The fine

246
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
50 Cent

247
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
For every

248
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
Access bushel I think it is

249
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:44,895
Are 239 excess bushels of wheat for which she was unifying about 117 bucks

250
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,431
In today's dollars

251
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,223
It's about two grand

252
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,247
2 Grand

253
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
My my father

254
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:58,463
Apparently he wasn't real crazy about that and I guess he didn't like that too much

255
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,279
If I have been 20 or 25 years old

256
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,167
I would have probably advised my father not to do what he did but I guess they sue the federal government

257
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
Huh

258
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,335
His army was like look I'm just trying to feed my cows come on I guess it went to

259
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
Are Court in Dayton Ohio

260
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,687
That was the first stop and I believe

261
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:25,599
That he was rambling to Roscoe the Ohio court agreed there's no

262
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,999
Commerce of any kind going on your unlike the original case with the boat price I believe I even remember

263
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:38,399
My sister telling me that the he came home and he was just

264
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,703
Delighted that he did win

265
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
But then

266
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,311
Governor pills the case and

267
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,919
The poorest when it got to the Supreme Court of the United States

268
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
He he he lost

269
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Key lost

270
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,903
In a decision that I think it's fair to say

271
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
Still

272
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,767
Drives conservatives and Libertarians bonkers

273
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,327
And I'm neither one of those things but I get it

274
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,631
What does Supreme Court set

275
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:15,007
Is it Roscoe filburn growing that extra weed and not selling it still

276
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
Counts as interstate commerce

277
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,383
Could have that extra week causes him to not

278
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
Buy it

279
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
On the market

280
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:29,855
He needs less wheat from the market in all the farmers of America did that

281
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:36,255
And that be really bad for the market the idea is that if you need more wheat than the quota you go on

282
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
On the market and buy it

283
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
Even though you can grow it yourself

284
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:44,959
Got to buy it because if everyone can produce their quota and then whatever extra they need

285
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,263
And pretty soon the regulation breaks

286
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,615
Which means that the government intervention in the wheat Market will have failed

287
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:58,527
You will have to feed it or attempt to regulate this Market therefore we have to regulate even things you don't do

288
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,439
That is so weird it's such a mine frankly it's like

289
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:11,839
He's not doing anything we can Hartwell on Behavior this is this is Obamacare

290
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Like the health care

291
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:19,519
Getting heated over Health Care the individual mandate

292
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,919
Just explain that's a reference to Barack Obama's healthcare plan hotly-debated couple years ago

293
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
Still hotly debated

294
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:31,807
What are the key ideas without plan is it in order for health care to be affordable for everyone

295
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
Everyone should have to buy it

296
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,391
So we're going to require people

297
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,671
To buy insurance

298
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
What else you pay a penalty

299
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:44,351
Which made a lot of people mad cuz they're like hey the government's force me to buy something I don't want my decision not to get Healthcare

300
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Is not

301
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,911
Participation in interstate commerce

302
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
It's not even economic activity

303
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,263
I'm sitting here on my couch not buying

304
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
You sitting here

305
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:57,919
From the individual perspective that makes perfect sense but if you can out

306
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,711
And Justice Kagan said this in court

307
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:03,551
It's not so simple as uninsured people

308
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
Are increasing

309
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,719
Normal family premium Congress

310
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Sitar

311
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,959
The price that everybody

312
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:27,359
Obamacare makes sense to me so it's a way of getting back to Roscoe

313
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Things you're not

314
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,223
Because you know farmers and Island this is the case

315
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
In which

316
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,111
Congress receives a tremendous amount of power from the US Supreme Court

317
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
Essentially this case

318
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,975
It says that Congress can regulate

319
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,047
Almost anything

320
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,327
And that is

321
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,655
The single most significant precedent

322
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
In the area of the Commerce Clause the Big Bang

323
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:10,111
Did anyone try to raise their hand in them

324
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,975
Will this be like whoa if you can regulate the non behavior of this American Farmer

325
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,887
Then that's not even a slippery slope that's like a cliff that goes right down like there's no say hello to that

326
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,215
Editorial from November 13 1942

327
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:30,079
Set if the farmer who grows feed for consumption on his own Farm competes with Commerce

328
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:36,223
Would not the housewife who makes herself address do so equally the net of the ruling in short seems to be

329
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,831
Did Congress can regulate every form of economic activity if it's soda size

330
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
Would not the housewife who makes herself address

331
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,719
You so eager like said yeah it's like yeah

332
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:53,119
If you make something with shoot I've my wife and I with our kids made these little like a miniature stuffed animals for them to play with the other day

333
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
Are we then in violation of some

334
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,751
Oh my God

335
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,919
After the Roscoe filburn case those 16 words in the whole definition

336
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Commerce

337
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:12,319
Expand because now Commerce wasn't just the buying and selling of things it was the knot

338
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
Buying and selling apps

339
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
And that expansion

340
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:19,488
That would go Way Beyond we it would go into Realms much much deeper

341
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
Much deeper in US

342
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
That's after the break

343
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
I'm Jared I'm Rod this is my perfect will continue in a moment

344
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
Is more perfect time Chatham rod

345
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:58,912
So we had the big bang of the Commerce Clause in that Wheatfield

346
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
Where Commerce

347
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
Scats

348
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,544
We find not just what you're buying and selling but also what you're not

349
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
Buying selling your negative Commerce

350
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,128
But at this point

351
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,688
Sum 41 we're still talking about

352
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,600
Markets were still talking about Commodities there comes a point when the use of the Commerce Clause goes woo

353
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
Beyond that

354
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,416
Where it gets into matters of the heart

355
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,464
You might say this is the moment

356
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
When the Commerce Clause gets

357
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Weaponized

358
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632

Aside from some time at college in Florida and a stint in the Coast Guard

376
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
Ali jr.

377
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,424
Has lived in Birmingham in his entire life

378
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,800
And the reason we call them up is that for 75 years his family ran

379
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,592
A Famous BBQ joint

380
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,896
Name dali this is your dad's business

1926 to this was passed to your dad who passed it to you yes

383
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,416
Okay we were in business together till he died

384
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:31,072
Holley's BBQ was located on Birmingham Southside the building we were in its time you're talkin about 1914

385
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,376
Natural 68 it was concrete

386
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Block

387
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,752
Big sign outside said world's best barbecue predicted for today

388
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
Barely during lunch

389
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,080
Align with stretch out the door

390
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,640
Ollie's was famous for its slow cooked

391
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:50,016
Pork and chicken and Fritz spicy vinegar BBQ sauce biking

392
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,320
Chocolate pies broasted a lot of pies

393
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,904
But all these was also famous or would become famous

394
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,696
For something else entirely

395
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
McAllister the times

396
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
The way things were

397
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
That time chords

398
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,912
Throughout South Birmingham

399
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
We had

400
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,312
Carryout business as well as sit down business

401
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
And

402
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Those

403
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,432
Bye-bye Black customers came in and

404
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
I ordered

405
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Carry out counter

406
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
Put their food out

407
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,040
And

408
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,880
Truth fact history

409
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,160
Take it on

410
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
With them to eat as opposed to sitting down and

411
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:36,096
What he saying is it all these barbecue was segregated if you were white you can eat inside if you are black

412
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,632
You couldn't remain

413
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Dwight work

414
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:46,336
So what is the temperature of the Commerce Clause okay so the Federal Gov

415
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,176
At the time this will be the Kennedy administration and LBJ

416
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:56,576
They want to come down and places like Ollie's barbecue but their hands were sort of tied

417
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:02,976
We have this thing called the Fourteenth Amendment says no State shall deprive any person

418
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:09,376
Of life liberty or property without due process of law nor shall any state the night equal protection of the laws

419
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:15,776
Any person died right after the Civil War

420
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,080
Basically outlaw

421
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
Things like segregation

422
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:26,016
Corseted work we have another 80 plus years of Jim Crow and the reason for that is it the Supreme

423
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,576
In court shortly after the 14th amendment was passed

424
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,672
Kind of neutered it not kind of they did

425
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:39,072
1 ways they did was by insisting that we read the 14th Amendment as being targeted

426
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:45,472
Only at States if you look at that sentence the second since the Fourteenth Amendment says no State no State shall

427
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:51,872
Deprive any person of life liberty or property without depressive problem is is when

428
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:58,272
A restaurant owner like Ali McClung the nice service to Black patrons it's not

429
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:04,672
Alabama doing the damage to the private business of Alabama ordered McClung family

430
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:10,048
To discriminate against black patrons they just did it so the 14th amendment can only get two states

431
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:16,960
Hear it has no reach because there's no State action there is nothing to regulate at the state level

432
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
So

433
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
The best decided to do

434
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,872
In a fascinating

435
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,432
Legal gymnastics is they decided to use

436
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,344
Commerce Clause Congress passes the most sweeping civil rights

437
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,976
Male ever to be written into the law has the right to be open to the public

438
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:45,120
July 2nd 1964 Congress passes a sweeping Civil Rights bill that was hinged on those six

439
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
16 words and I will

440
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,424
Explain to you how

441
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
It's kind of fascinating

442
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,496
It's just a second the first

443
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,544
Just to get us to that point

444
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,872
So 1964 Civil Rights

445
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
Active

446
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
Did you desegregate right away

447
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
No

448
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,272
No

449
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,392
We were we were not happy with it obviously

450
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,976
I want to read you something that you said in 1960

451
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
Before I believe these are

452
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,560
Serve your account of something that happened in

453
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Indian restaurant

454
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,656
Day after the Civil Rights Act was passed

455
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:21,984
A black man comes into the restaurant asking to be served

456
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,544
And and you turn him away

457
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:28,128
Forty-five minutes later comes back with a young girl for all the black

458
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,432
People they sit down at the counter they want to know

459
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,016
Why you why all these wouldn't serve them

460
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,296
And they were taking notes

461
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,368
And your CO2 the same may seem like agitators

462
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
Yeah in fact they were they

463
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,720
They were folks and came

464
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,304
And when around several places

465
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:47,840
Justin

466
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
Test the law basically yeah

467
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,960
And you are a and you return those books away

468
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Yes

469
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Get timeout

470
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
Why

471
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,336
I was just because that's way

472
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,664
Had always done this way

473
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
Until the law

474
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
Got to judicate it

475
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
We weren't going to

476
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
Unilaterally

477
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,928
Change my thank-you note from their perspectives are there because the laws been changed

478
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,488
Yeah

479
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
Yes

480
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,960
Ali says right after the Civil Rights Act was passed

481
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:31,872
Serve an emergency meeting was called of the Birmingham Restaurant Association Unidad 1

482
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
I discussed with the

483
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,224
What's a mammoth executive of it

484
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,016
This was going to be such a

485
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,064
Potentially

486
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
Harmful

487
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:45,440
Restaurant businesses make you would miss all your way customers is that what you worried about

488
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,744
I mean that was a possibility

489
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
And

490
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,584
Somebody ought to do something

491
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
So we

492
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,424
Coming up being

493
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,192
Once

494
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Do something

495
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
I fall asleep

496
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Today filed the suit

497
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,152
Basically saying to the federal government you have no right to barge into our

498
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
Small

499
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
Independent

500
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
Local business

501
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,248
Start was

502
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
They can't really

503
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:17,184
Tell us what to do because we're not an interstate business and that's all that the federal government regulates and

504
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
Up until that point that was all they had regulator

505
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,096
The case went to the US District Court for the Northern District

506
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,168
Of Alabama at the lower court level 3 Jersey special

507
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:27,936
Panel

508
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,984
We had a unanimous

509
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,008
Decision

510
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
Our favor

511
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
The Alabama Court agreed

512
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,896
There was no interstate commerce happening year

513
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
And that

514
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,944
Ollie's did not have to

515
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,992
Desegregate they could sell their ribs to whoever they want

516
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
And we were

517
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,296
Optimistic about that

518
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,832
Government in appeals

519
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,880
And the case

520
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,184
They say it goes all the way to the Supreme Court

521
00:29:54,304 --> 00:30:00,448
Right let me know explain to you how the government made this argument cuz they made it in court

522
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:06,848
October 5th 1964 General Archibald Cox

523
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
Why the government should be allowed to use the Commerce Clause of all things to desegregate

524
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:19,648
Ablaze operate a restaurant in Birmingham Alabama specializing in

525
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:26,048
Barbecued Meats this is a business that sells and buys a lot of meat

526
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:32,448
July 1 1964

527
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:38,848
$69,683 to be exact and

528
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,176
Birmingham Alabama to plant

529
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:48,576
Song that that plan came from other states so they've moved in

530
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:57,280
In other words you think you're a local business but you're not meat is sourced from places other than Alabama

531
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:03,680
What about ketchup ecstatically

532
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
Not minding Alabama soul

533
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:11,616
You know we bought it from a local vendor that local vendor probably bought it from somebody who bought it from somebody that got it from out of state

534
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:18,016
Reaching beyond what it ever been done before basically was basically telling them the same thing they told

535
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
Roscoe filburn

536
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
You are not an island

537
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,744
And that was only the government's first argument they had another art

538
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,864
That is a second then still more directly it was even more

539
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
Radical

540
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
Swaying racial discrimination in restaurant

541
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
Interstate

542
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,312
Which is caused by the artificial narrowing

543
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
Supermarket

544
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
Resulting from the eggs

545
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,456
So here's the argument

546
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:52,064
If you deny black people access to restaurants and hotels

547
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,904
You are effectively shutting down interstate travel by them

548
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,000
Imports of the country where this practice is commonplace

549
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
Entire

550
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:05,888
Deep South you're limiting their ability to cross state lines and

551
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,936
The central argument

552
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,472
Suggestion is that

553
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,032
When you discriminate against someone

554
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
You create

555
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,384
Downstream

556
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
Negative

557
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,944
Commercial effects

558
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,504
Like you create a chilling effect

559
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Because

560
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:27,648
The person you're discriminating against is then less likely to travel across state lines

561
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Send money

562
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
So in effect you are

563
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,792
Depressing their future interstate commerce

564
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
If you ask

565
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
Black people

566
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,888
With this experience

567
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,192
From this time.

568
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,752
They were universally say

569
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,080
We never left home unless

570
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,128
Every Tire

571
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,408
Was triple-check

572
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,480
Every belt was triple checked in the car

573
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,784
Because we did not want

574
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,624
To have a car breakdown in a hostile southern town

575
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
And get lunch.

576
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
Right right

577
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
It is

578
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,024
An entire system

579
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:09,120
Of travel and commerce that's at stake here

580
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:12,448
Essentially the argument was discrimination is bad for business

581
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Expensive

582
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
And

583
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,824
Ultimately in a unanimous decision

584
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,848
The Supreme Court

585
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,200
Same court that 100 years earlier had basically gutted the 14th Amendment this

586
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,224
Supreme Court

587
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:25,760
Agreed

588
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,624
That discrimination in restaurants pose significant burdens on the quote

589
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,208
Interstate flow of food and upon the movement of products generally

590
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
Remember that decision coming down

591
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
I'm certainly

592
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,376
Where were you

593
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,912
Pause at work

594
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,728
Can you tell me a little bit about how

595
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,008
You and your dad

596
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,312
Process that decision

597
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,616
Simply

598
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
Certain one who came in after that

599
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
And they were

600
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,504
The very next day

601
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
There was a group of local law civil rights leaders

602
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,856
Who came in tonight launch

603
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,416
I knew some of them by

604
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:06,720
Haven't seen him in the news that sort of thing

605
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,512
They were not regular customers

606
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,816
Orlando after frankly but

607
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Lay

608
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,424
Celebrated our what even want to say

609
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,240
Tested I don't know what the motive was I came in late lunch

610
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,800
They got served it's like anybody else

611
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,616
They came in and it was fine

612
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,664
The law

613
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
What's inside at Seoul

614
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
That was it

615
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
With a tents

616
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,576
No

617
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,416
Ellen the waitress who was why you no one was

618
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
She was a little

619
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,536
Answer about it and was it this way just to see a black woman yes

620
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,096
It was now but she was

621
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,680
Like most my employees been there a very long time

622
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,704
Panda

623
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
Have never

624
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,776
Served other black folks

625
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
In a sit-down situation and

626
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,872
And

627
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
Of course

628
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
It was

629
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Little bit

630
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
Upsetting but

631
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,832
Different cute little hesitant at first I

632
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,648
Answers to right hand side women

633
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
She didn't we didn't

634
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,232
That was not a problem

635
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:16,352
After the ruling it's not as if a lot of Black customers 70/30 coming into Ali's Barber

636
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
Q they didn't

637
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,448
Chris how a guy named Nathan Turner Jr.

638
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,008
2014 he was interviewed

639
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Turn into herpes

640
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
He grew up nearby Ali

641
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,640
Just the fact that I've always pushed it that far

642
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,688
To take it to the Supreme Court

643
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
It left a bad taste

644
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
Pun intended

645
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,344
In the miles of a lot of black

646
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
People in Birmingham

647
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,208
In-N-Out 53 years later

648
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,536
How do you think about that Supreme Court decision

649
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Well

650
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:52,448
You're at if you're asking about segregation that's one thing we ask about Spring Court and

651
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:56,800
Seasoning on the Commerce Clause I still disagree with the

652
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,360
Let me put it real

653
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
Real succinctly

654
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,688
I think

655
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
What you had

656
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
And that

657
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Decision

658
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
Was it rather than

659
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,624
Civicsource

660
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
Correct but I don't know

661
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,744
It rather than three-quarters of the Congress

662
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,352
And 3/5 of the states I believe it is having two

663
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
Or maybe 2/3 Carlos whichever it is

664
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
Having two

665
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
Vote to

666
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
Repeal an amendment

667
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,520
The Constitution

668
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,104
You had basically 9 appointees who

669
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Repeal the 10th

670
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
Amendment to the Constitution

671
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:36,992
10th Amendment basically says that the powers not given to the feds

672
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
Are reserved for

673
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
For the states

674
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
For the people

675
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
That's about as succinct as I can say it

676
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,184
But you understand how this is going to sound to a lot of our listeners

677
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,232
I mean that you are making a

678
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,768
States rights argument

679
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,352
As a not-so-veiled way to continue to discriminate

680
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,400
They're really in the end this is not about stay

681
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,960
States rights I think that's going to I was going to sound to a lot of pee

682
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,032
Well it may very well but it's not the case

683
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Was there segregation

684
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
Yes

685
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,200
Where we going to voluntarily

686
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
And that

687
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
Probably not

688
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,880
Would we go back and reinstate if we could no absolutely not

689
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
But the

690
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,000
Issue that you're talkin about with

691
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,816
Commerce Clause in the

692
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,096
Constitutional

693
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
Issue

694
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
You're still just what I said

695
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,824
So you still believe 53 years later that the Supreme Court got it wrong that they should have never

696
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,920
Use the Commerce Clause to make you desegregate Ollie's

697
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
Yep that is correct

698
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
But

699
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:44,064
Don't hear me say that I don't want to go back to have segregation

700
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:48,416
That's a separate issue but is it separate I guess is my question you know

701
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,696
My God grant you

702
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,488
If you think of it in the abstract

703
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,816
Federal government being able to regulate

704
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:56,352
Commerce across

705
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
All

706
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Boundaries

707
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
Is an enormous power

708
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,288
And he could be a scary power so I grant you that at the same time

709
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,336
You have a Civil Rights Act

710
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
That

711
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,432
It speaks to a different amendment in the Constitution

712
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:15,552
Ryan that you and your father will not willing to follow so how is the government going to get you to

713
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
To pay attention

714
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
And to get in line

715
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,648
They've got to use the Commerce Clause

716
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,696
So on some level isn't it

717
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,744
Isn't the power

718
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
Present

719
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,816
Because the other principles

720
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,376
They would otherwise regulate your Behaviour

721
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,400
Just aren't working

722
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
What that's that's the point

723
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,264
Choose which

724
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,824
Which is the priority

725
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
Basically

726
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,200
I understand you were which is the priority

727
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
I will

728
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
Which is the priority of

729
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:49,088
Those amendments

730
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,672
Answer for you the 10th Amendment that grants states rights

731
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
For everything. Enumerated

732
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,744
Outweighs

733
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
The Dignity of black

734
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
No

735
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
No

736
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,400
Will put so say to me differently

737
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Well

738
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
The 10th Amendment

739
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,080
Left that to the state

740
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
The Fourth Amendment yes

741
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
An agreement to the 14th Amendment

742
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
Gifts

743
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,784
People rights

744
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
Everyone writes

745
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,368
But here's the thing about rights

746
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,464
It's kind of like the first law of thermodynamics

747
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
There's only

748
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
And people don't realize this a lot of time

749
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
That's the only so many rights

750
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,888
Only a finite number rights

751
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
If you take some

752
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
Give something to someone

753
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,800
They come from someone else or somewhere else

754
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Now

755
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,384
It's very well to say that

756
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,968
The end of segregation

757
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,016
Was a higher right

758
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
Memo important

759
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
Ban

760
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,696
They misuse of the Commerce Clause

761
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
What are we

762
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
Say

763
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
But you're still a balance and just

764
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
Which one you

765
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
Think is most important

766
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,496
Today's products recalled zero-sum

767
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,176
Bali's basic point

768
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,480
We talked about this for another hour

769
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:23,040
Was it in achieving desegregation that way

770
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
By the way

771
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,368
Civil Rights Act

772
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
64

773
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
Dramatically altered

774
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
Desegregated

775
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Huge parts

776
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,256
By doing it that way

777
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,536
He says with the Commerce Clause

778
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,352
Something was sacrificed

779
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
He calls it a zero

780
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,912
I wouldn't call it that

781
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
I don't think most

782
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
We call it that

783
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,312
Treating people with dignity and equality is a net win

784
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,360
.

785
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
But

786
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
It is legitimately strange

787
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,600
Did the government had to take such a roundabout

788
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,392
Ass backward way

789
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,928
To fix this

790
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:06,048
To fix this grave Injustice what you would think would be the obvious

791
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,864
That you would go right to those civil rights

792
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,168
Parts of the Constitution

793
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:16,544
It was like, that's what's weird is it we have the 14th Amendment and yet we go to

794
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,592
The Commerce Clause or something

795
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,616
That is

796
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:24,736
So clearly stated in one of the Amendments lawyers are very tricky

797
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,576
Search Jamie Floyd Again by the way

798
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
The lawyers in those cases

799
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,184
Is that what they wanted to win

800
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:37,536
They wanted to win more than they wanted to make a social statement about

801
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:42,144
Equal justice equal rights the 14th Amendment I mean those things mattered

802
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,704
Most of all they wanted to win

803
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,264
They wanted to shut down discrimination

804
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
At those lunch counters

805
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:54,943
And if Congress could shut them down or require them to open their doors to all Americans using

806
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,735
Those 16 words

807
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
I'm okay with that

808
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
Yeah

809
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,063
Yeah

810
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,903
No I mean obviously the if the ends do justify the means in that case

811
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:09,535
But it does make you if you were to put that case and the weak case in your mind as a kind of split screen you

812
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
It's

813
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,887
It's a little strange because I do think

814
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,911
Okay we have

815
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:19,007
I didn't mean to I said hopefully we're Americans with principles that matter

816
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,079
You know that we believe in equality believe in racial Justice

817
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,639
But really we just believe in money

818
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,991
And we can do all the other stuff by bootstrapping it

819
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
E-commerce

820
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
But somehow as as pure principles

821
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:39,487
Play what don't have teeth while it's deeply troubling that we have to use Commerce to achieve our higher

822
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
Are values

823
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,559
That is weird to me that is

824
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,839
Fundamentally weird to me

825
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,655
It's kind of cynical

826
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
I mean

827
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
I

828
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,983
You are right we are

829
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,543
At least in large part about

830
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Commerce Center

831
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,871
But if that's who we are

832
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,967
Then we should embrace it and use it to our advantage

833
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:06,367
And if we can use it to our advantage perhaps it does take us to our higher principle

834
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,951
How to understand why it's not all bad

835
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:17,119
One of Jamie's .22 hadn't actually thought it was that

836
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,399
Legislating morality

837
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,471
Fletchling what is good and what is bad

838
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,263
Doesn't always go well

839
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,591
Cuz we very often don't agree

840
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:32,223
Galaxy there been times where people kept slaves and thought that was just fine

841
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,551
That was right

842
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:40,415
400 years you had the 14th amendment in place but it couldn't solve all these Barbie

843
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,975
And here was a way

844
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:49,375
For the government without going at the moral questions head-on

845
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:56,031
Government budget and all the way into the barbecue joints in the hotels in the restaurants and the houses and now the cake shops of Amer

846
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:00,127
Erica and all the way down into the local

847
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:05,503
And it was because of this increasingly expansive idea of Commerce

848
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:09,343
That was now no longer the buying and selling of things or the knot

849
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,647
Buying and selling of things it was now

850
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,439
Any Behavior

851
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,511
They could create a kind of butterfly fish

852
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
That might one

853
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,399
Day many steps Downstream

854
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,447
Have a future effect

855
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,007
On the buying selling things

856
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,895
Was right his case that was a massive shift

857
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:41,599
It shifted totally the federal government's role Beyond business even if you

858
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,391
I think it's good then that's fine

859
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,695
And it's for the better but

860
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,999
Just asked me realize that it was a

861
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,047
MasterChef from

862
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,583
The way

863
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
The country of Benin

864
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
Up before that time

865
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,383
Ft McClellan case James Chen says

866
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
Service government

867
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
Use

868
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:07,711
Of the Commerce Clause

869
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:14,111
Pretty much went wild yeah there was just no real limit

870
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:20,511
Begin wave those 16 word sort of like a magic want to pass laws on everything from Fair labor standards

871
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:26,911
2 marijuana is a schedule 1 drugs

872
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:33,311
Spell justice for victims of trafficking

873
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:39,711
Species 1992 professional and amateur sports sports protection act which forbids States

874
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:46,111
Authorized Sports gambling

875
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,415
To make the argument itself

876
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,719
What's the government even has to defend itself

877
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:57,119
James Chen says there were times when the government would pass a law it get taken to court and the government would basically

878
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,143
We not show up

879
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:03,775
And he would still with the governor even has to argue

880
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,895
So you can see the McClung case as sort of a second big bang but then

881
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
You get to the mid-90s

882
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:19,135
At this point 1994 U of a democratic President Bill Clinton Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress

883
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
And

884
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,439
Together they pass

885
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,231
The violence against women act

886
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,535
Today is the first day of spring

887
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,119
And I think it's appropriate that we begin a new season of Hope

888
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:35,775
In the fight against domestic violence

889
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,311
Thank you all for being here

890
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,103
This is an important day

891
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,967
The Act was sort of a sweeping rethink of the federal government's role in

892
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,807
Trying to prevent violence against women it beefed-up investigations

893
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,879
Prosecution

894
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:55,743
It allowed women to sue their alleged attackers in federal court

895
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:02,143
Responsibility domestic violence is now the number one health risk for women between the ages of 15 and 44

896
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
Or Nah country

897
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,775
And the law was hinged on the Commerce Clause same essential argument is in the Barbie

898
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:15,711
That same fault my name is Christy Brown Colour to my life

899
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,551
A woman named Christy brzonkala starts her freshman year at Virginia Tech

900
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:24,927
And just weeks in September 1994 I was raped by two football players in my own dorm

901
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:28,511
I'd met them for the first time just 15 minutes before they assaulted me

902
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:34,911
These two football player she alleged had raped her repeatedly on a single night in 1994 I was raped three times

903
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,215
She went to the local campus authorities

904
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,263
She told her story

905
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,823
Call children hearings didn't go to the police

906
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:44,639
What is suspended one of the two students he appealed

907
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
1

908
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,431
And when you returned

909
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,223
Christy brzonkala dropped out of school

910
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,343
Christy brzonkala

911
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,671
Ultimately decides to sue her alleged attackers and the school

912
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,231
Under this new law the violence against women act

913
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
And the case

914
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,839
Ultimately makes it to the Supreme Court

915
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:11,263
Will your argument now number 99 5 Christy brzonkala vs Antonio Morrison

916
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:17,663
When Christie's case got to Supreme Court her lawyer made the same argument

917
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:21,503
About women that the government is made in the Ollie's Barbeque case about black people

918
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,551
That discrimination

919
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,343
Or in this case outright violence

920
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:31,999
Has a huge Downstream effect on the economy has concluded the gender-based violence

921
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,559
It's actually affect the national economy

922
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:38,911
Gender-based violence and the fear of that discriminatory violence

923
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,215
Two truths women's travel interstate

924
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:45,311
Restricts women's choice of jobs and ability to perform those jobs

925
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:50,175
Reduces National productivity and increases medical and other costs

926
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:54,783
And again the court was given tons of evidence about the economic effects

927
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
Congress heard from women

928
00:48:56,575 --> 00:49:02,719
Who's batter is kept their partners for morphine every year this cost the country bill

929
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:07,327
Billions of dollars and that economic Downstream effect was not hard to prove in this case

930
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:14,239
She dropped out if you ever get it right it's not just her it's everyone else who similarly situated

931
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,055
But in this case

932
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,663
Yarygin what's happening in a very different time in the country very different mood

933
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,503
In front of an increasingly conservative Supreme core

934
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:33,951
It just wasn't buying it anymore and Arbors on Carla's complaint alleges that she was the victim of a

935
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:40,351
Songs of Chief Justice rehnquist reading the majority opinion

936
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:46,751
Justice could failed to provide her a remedy for Morrison's conduct but gender motivated crimes

937
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:53,151
The phrase economic activity

938
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:59,551
Another word for very sorry for what may have happened to Christine bronkala but this is not Commerce

939
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:05,951
This is why eyelids suggestion was at least in the Ali's case there was something

940
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:12,351
Here they felt like the link to Commerce was too thin

941
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:16,703
Arguments in Congress May regulate non-economic violence coming all time.

942
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:21,055
Based solely on that conducts remote effect on interstate commerce

943
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,383
Chief justice rehnquist got his majority

944
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,919
2 * 2

945
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,199
Chipaway

946
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
At the commerce power

947
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,063
YouTube Tiny teeny teeny weeny little bit

948
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,367
Jamie Floyd says that

949
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,135
Tempt

950
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,927
To roll it back

951
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,487
Continue Suites rolling back

952
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,791
It is rolling back

953
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,863
Still pretty powerful don't get us wrong but where were left

954
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,655
At the end of the day

955
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,239
Is it a really confusing place

956
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,775
Ali

957
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:56,127
McClung excluding black people from his dining room

958
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,735
Yeah for commercial act we can sit reprehensible but I

959
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,807
I would like to think that raping Christine

960
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,855
Would be at least as bad

961
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,671
Totally what

962
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
This kind of

963
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,791
Absurd abstraction gets us to

964
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,071
And in

965
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,911
A coherent Ideal World

966
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,703
Can't be right

967
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:27,359
Maybe that's just the inevitable thing that happens when you try and make

968
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:33,759
Make it all about money

969
