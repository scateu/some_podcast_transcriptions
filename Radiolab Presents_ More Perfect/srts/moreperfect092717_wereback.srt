1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,840
Everybody is just

00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,120
Quiet

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,728
When you can hear your heart beating

We're back

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Hear something about rides if you give something to someone they come from someone else

11
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:46,592
Rocking the Boat

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,664
