00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,888
WNYC Studios

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,408
This is my perfect I'm Jack I'm rod

3
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
J a story

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,480
From our producer

5
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,504
Julie Longoria

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,600
So I've been working on an episode about sex discrimination for like

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,624
Months now

8
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,184
We're supposed to release it

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,304
Sexual harassment scandals have been golf Harvey Weinstein Senator Al Franken

10
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,584
This week

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:41,728
Actor Kevin Spacey today Troy more today the story we're going to tell is not about sexual harassment

12
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,008
Quick I can't

13
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:49,408
Thanks tree with all the stuff that's happening look at what's happening with you

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
Thousands posted the claims online using the simple phrase me too

15
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,648
Talking about it and I can't help but think that we seen this before

16
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,720
Outcry for public change

17
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,536
A backlash

18
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
Women out there

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
Seriously

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
Like we're in our respective quarters and men to help us letting out a big screen

21
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
How do people not know but

22
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,248
When things quiet down

23
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
Will there be a change

24
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:38,560
And what kind of change is the kind that will stick

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
Today story

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,288
It's about a time in the not-so-distant past when there was a similarly loud rock is division in our country

27
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
Over sexual equality

28
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
Wonder Woman

29
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
Quiet

30
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:53,920
Strategically

31
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
Laid the foundation

32
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
A real change

33
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:04,416
Supreme Court of the United States

34
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:17,216
Supreme Court of the United States

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:22,848
God save the United States and this honorable Court

36
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Here we are

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
I'm going to ask an orderly false question which is where would you like to start as if we haven't been doing this

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
You're so damn long

39
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Okay

40
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
So let me outline

41
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
The

42
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,392
Basic dilemma that's at the heart of the story

43
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,952
I'm going to put it to you as a question

44
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
If you were to

45
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,096
Do a Ctrl F in the Constitution like how many times do you think the words

46
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
How

47
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Sex

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,408
Is one one time

49
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,712
In the Nineteenth Amendment which

50
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,760
Grants people the right to vote

51
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
Based on

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Really

53
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
Yes that's the only time

54
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:43,488
The only time which is crazy cuz we are looking at is there a sex where that's not sex like gender or some

55
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:50,912
Is there like ladies in the condition of women no women have a

56
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Problem

57
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
Which is that basically we're not in the car

58
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,800
Accept it like in this one little spot

59
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,872
So when it comes to discriminating against women

60
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,408
Some people have argued that

61
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
You

62
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
There's nothing in the Constitution

63
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:10,112
That says you can't do it certainly the Constitution does not require sexual

64
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,160
Discrimination on the basis of sex

65
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,512
Constitution doesn't require it it simply doesn't forbid it

66
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,559
Fatboy Justice Antonin Scalia

67
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,863
It doesn't mean nobody ever voted

68
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
For that

69
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
Where do you get it from

70
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:29,823
There was nothing it said that I mean not not those words explicitly but there is nothing that says you can't discriminate

71
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
Not on the basis of sex

72
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,431
That's legal editor Cristian farias

73
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
We had a 40

74
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
18th Amendment

75
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,015
I told people that we are

76
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,343
Equal under the law that everyone is equal protection of the laws

77
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,439
It does not say Miss, I never applied the 14th Amendment

78
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:52,095
Identify the 15th that's Martha Griffiths congresswoman when you think about the history of the Fourteenth Amendment

79
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:55,935
As legal editorial Linda Hershman says the Fourteenth Amendment was

80
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,031
Passed in the aftermath of the Civil War along with the 13th and 5th

81
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,175
13th Amendment abolishing slavery and 16th Amendment giving black people a black men the right

82
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,223
Boat if you understand that

83
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,503
14th Amendment to be

84
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,903
A part of that Trio of amendments okay it was meant to bring equality to black people

85
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,511
When the Fifteenth Amendment have been written which that every citizen could vote

86
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,839
In The Name Of Heaven so I couldn't women vote

87
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
Why don't you why don't you have to have the 19th Amendment

88
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:30,751
Of course the answer why is he didn't consider women people

89
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,919
There was this basic assumption in the lot

90
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:43,295
Equality for black people is one thing but men and women

91
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:50,719
They're different it was the case that the Supreme Court had never once

92
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:57,119
Met a distinction between men and women it didn't like Wendy Williams law professor emeritus at Georgetown

93
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:03,519
What are some greatest hits of ridiculous distinction

94
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,615
What's the case called Bradwell and it was 1873 or 4

95
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
In that case

96
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,919
A woman

97
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
Wanted to become

98
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
A lawyer

99
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:18,623
Illinois Bar said and the justices said that that that was a perfectly good rule

100
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Because

101
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,671
The justice system

102
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,999
Could be seen as not appropriate for women

103
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,279
Now

104
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,583
Let's jump clear into the next Century here

105
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
1948

106
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,679
Okay it was called gessert versus Cleary that went

107
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,703
The Supreme Court

108
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
And the issue was

109
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,799
Whether women could be bartenders

110
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,335
The court

111
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,615
Thought that was

112
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Pretty humorous

113
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,735
That it made sense that women could not be bartenders

114
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
Unless their husbands or fathers

115
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:53,695
Were in charge of the bar

116
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
You know women are not

117
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
Supposed to be at the bar at either bar those two cases represent attitudes

118
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
Almost 80 years apart

119
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,239
Women belonged in the private

120
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
Sphere

121
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,591
That was not only the place it was built into their

122
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Bodies

123
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
And that was the assumption

124
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,711
Bro bong

125
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
Long time

126
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
But just about

127
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:27,231
67

128
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:32,863
This country who feel like they're being pushed around things had started to

129
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,727
Come to a boil

130
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
Sex and race

131
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
Because they are easy visible differences have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into Superior

132
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
An inferior group

133
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
So in the late sixties and early seventies people like Gloria Steinem

134
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,975
Other than those chosen audre Lorde

135
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:05,375
Stop sexism to get some traction saying okay it's time to put it in the car

136
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Constitution

137
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:12,543
Hurry up and historians say it's a constitutional convention for women

138
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,103
Resolution APUSH

139
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
For something called the Equal Rights Amendment

140
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
What are your hopes for do you think it will be ratified the stratified early next year

141
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,375
In 1975 it will be ratified

142
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,727
But it didn't get the boats in 1975

143
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,055
1976 will be the year

144
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:50,687
Or in 1976

145
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
4 in 1977

146
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
And the movement is stalled

147
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Why what

148
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:58,879
What's dalda

149
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Well

150
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
A lot

151
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:07,071
But much of the credit goes to this woman

152
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
A woman named Phyllis

153
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:14,495
Sloppily my husband Fred for letting me come today

154
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,871
I love to say that because it irritates the women's libbers more than anything that I said

155
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
She was a lawyer and a

156
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
Self-described housewife

157
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,991
Who started the movement

158
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
Call stop Yaris

159
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,671
Beneficiary

160
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,511
Give me a great opportunity to get out from under their obligation

161
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,863
Her position was that the Equal Rights Amendment would actually strip women

162
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,703
Of the special privilege that they have that comes from being a woman

163
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:51,359
We not I think though the laws of our country have given a very wonderful status to the married woman and the wife has a great deal

164
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
Mini rice

165
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,735
For example she has the legal right to be supported by her

166
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,271
And she said

167
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
If this amendment passes

168
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,855
It will be certain unintended

169
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Consequences

170
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:09,791
Amendment says you cannot discriminate on account of fact and if you wanted to know

171
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:16,191
Marriage license to a man and a man or deny homosexual the right to teach in the schools

172
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:24,127
And that would be unconstitutional under era

173
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
And that argument

174
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,247
Caught on

175
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,599
They are things that could happen from the passage of an era

176
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
None of us

177
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:40,511
Would like to see happen with generation after generation deteriorate

178
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:46,911
I think that there would be homosexual to expect preferential treatment

179
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:53,311
To hear what I have to say cuz you know what's going to happen if I passed the ER there will be $100

180
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:59,711
Bathroom swimming using all our stall County Waste in the paper towels in the yard and all

181
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:06,111
Drive to

182
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:11,999
I don't know what we're going to do

183
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,815
Had the Equal Rights Amendment passed

184
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:20,191
Legal editor Lynn Hershman against it would have looked a lot like the racial Civil Rights Movement

185
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Did

186
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
But the Equal Rights Amendment did not pass

187
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,799
It fell

188
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
3

189
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
States

190
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,359
Short

191
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:33,759
To get a constitutional amendment passed without you need 3/4 of state legislatures to say they want it

192
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
That is

193
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,575
38 out of 50

194
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,367
They only ever got 35

195
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Dude

196
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
So the question is

197
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
If you want to get equal rights

198
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
For women

199
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Written into the law

200
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,095
What do you do

201
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,887
There's no era

202
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,191
The women's lib movement Spark

203
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Backlash

204
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
What

205
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,031
Do you do

206
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
Well

207
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:00,895
Enter stage left

208
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,599
Notorious RBG

209
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,999
Ruth Bader Ginsburg RBG can do 20 push-ups and not the so-called girl kind

210
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
For she was a Supreme Court Justice or a workout sensation before all that

211
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,239
Ruth Ginsburg she was at the ACLU

212
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
This was in the 70s

213
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:32,383
And one of the characteristics of Ruth Ginsburg which exists to this day

214
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,711
You can hear this

215
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,063
It's the first time she argued in front of the Supreme Court in 1973

216
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
When you ask her question

217
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
There would be

218
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Silence

219
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,535
Enough silence

220
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
To make a person nervous and start trying to help her answer the question

221
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Kuwait

222
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
But

223
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
We can imagine

224
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,407
It was in one of those long pauses

225
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
At Ruth Bader Ginsburg

226
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,271
Rescued from the key principles behind the era

227
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:16,671
Repackage them and March them in through a side door

228
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:21,023
Sex like race is a visible characteristics

229
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
Bearing no necessary relationship to ability

230
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,263
Has been the major bases for unjustified for at least

231
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:49,951
Where to buy cannabis like what it what exactly did RBG do so let me walk you through it.

232
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
It's beautiful

233
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
But you're a fight is underway

234
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,631
And RBG and her colleagues are watching this

235
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,679
Right and they're getting worried

236
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
What if the area doesn't pass

237
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
What are we going to do if that's the case

238
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
How are we going to get equal rights for women

239
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,591
So they decided

240
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
Okay as an alternate approach

241
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,687
Let's go back to the fourteenth

242
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,247
The 14th amendments immediate objective

243
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
What's the provide National Protection

244
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
For the newly freed slaves

245
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
You know which

246
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,743
As we said was designed from the beginning to be only about race

247
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
Suggest broader object

248
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,607
The states were prevented from depriving any person

249
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Equal protection

250
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Have the balls

251
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,471
Well it says the word person

252
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
So that

253
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,567
Should include women

254
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
If they could just get the courts to see it that way then

255
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
By default almost we would have

256
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
I sort of era

257
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
And accordingly

258
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,551
The task was

259
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,879
Showing that the racially inflected

260
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,927
14th Amendment apply

261
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,999
Sex the what about the law is she trying to

262
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
To change what

263
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,815
What does she want the court to say

264
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,679
She wants the court to say that sex would be treated just like race

265
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
And here's why that's so important

266
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,799
When the court sees racial discrimination

267
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,639
Under the Fourteenth Amendment it takes a really hard line

268
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,687
Looks at it really really closely

269
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Or at least it's supposed

270
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
Whereas other kinds of discrimination

271
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,063
Not so much

272
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,135
It is actually some discrimination is necessary

273
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
Discriminate

274
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
It has to

275
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,511
It discriminates between 18 year old and 17 year olds

276
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,607
Between criminal and non-criminal that would be otherwise right

277
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
But the courts decided that race

278
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,447
Is going to be a big red flag

279
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,103
They're going to ask government's legislators presidents to have a compelling reason a compelling State interest

280
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
Do race discrimination

281
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
Otherwise

282
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
It's going to be on Cox

283
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
You with me so far

284
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,087
Yes to discriminate based on race you need to pass a really super hard test

285
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,903
By the way the legal name for this test

286
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
Strict

287
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Scrutiny

288
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
Animation

289
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
Call the lake

290
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,583
We mean business or something like that

291
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,167
But anyway the point was that like they took it seriously

292
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,031
Which you know back in the day they weren't doing with sex discrimination at all

293
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,407
Because when legislators would come up with these Lots like this women can't be bartender sloth

294
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
The Supreme Court would be like

295
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,711
You know

296
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
You guys probably have a good reason for that

297
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:27,391
Listen to review reason it can just be a reason does not to be very good this up to be good

298
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,743
Victor even maybe even make it up on the fly it just has to be a reason

299
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,327
For upholding this law like in the case of the bartenders law

300
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
Bars are dangerous

301
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,703
Women need more protection be like okay

302
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,775
So RBG needed a way to convince the court

303
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,103
To be as intense about sex determination

304
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,639
As they were about Reese's

305
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
Discrimination

306
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,223
But how do you convince an audience

307
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Of men

308
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,319
Were used to discriminate on the basis

309
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,879
Who been doing it for years

310
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,719
How do you convince them that discrimination is a bad thing

311
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,375
I think of people who want to keep women down would like nothing better than to women go off in the corner at

312
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
I speak only to win

313
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
Nothing would happen

314
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,543
This is her giving a recent talk about her 1970s strategy

315
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
You need to persuade

316
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
Men

317
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
If this is right for society

318
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
Part one of her strategy

319
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,271
Choose your words carefully

320
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
The head of Secretariat Columbia

321
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,159
Who said I'm typing these things for you

322
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,463
And jumping out all over the

323
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,255
Pages Texas

324
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:40,095
Don't you know that

325
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,887
The audience you are address

326
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
The first

327
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
Association

328
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Of those men

329
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
What the word sex

330
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
He's not what you're talking about

331
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
Why don't you use a grammar book

332
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,503
Charm use gender

333
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,319
But you know the word sex has a charge to it

334
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Gender

335
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,135
Cooler

336
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,695
In part two of her strategy

337
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,999
Choose your cases carefully

338
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
This is all happening in the 70s

339
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,887
Eastwind RBG is the head of ACLU women's rights project

340
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,239
So she's deciding which kinds of cases the ACLU is going to support

341
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,823
As they make their way to an all-male Supreme Court

342
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Strategy was

343
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,943
If we live in a man's world right now

344
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
We need to find cases

345
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,807
But nine men at this moment

346
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:36,927
Can handle so for example early on her tenure at the women's rights project

347
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,487
The other Lefty lawyers

348
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,303
Are suggesting that the women's movement needs

349
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,095
To take up the cause of us being right

350
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,143
And she says

351
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Not

352
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Yes

353
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,215
And I think

354
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,751
Go slow

355
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,055
Is the right approach

356
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,335
She said first

357
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
We need to go after that

358
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Small

359
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,199
Insidious idea

360
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,015
At the Supreme Court had been keeping alive for years

361
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,367
The laws of our country have given a very wonderful status to the married woman

362
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,207
That Phyllis Schlafly idea that discrimination is actually good

363
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
For women gender classes

364
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,511
Applications

365
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Will always rationalize

366
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
As favors

367
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
The women

368
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
And so

369
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:23,007
RPG decided not just to bring cases where women were the victims of

370
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
Discrimination

371
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:24,799
Okay

372
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
My name is Curtis Craig

373
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
She brought cases

374
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
Where men are the victim

375
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
Who were you as an 18 year old

376
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,271
Now that's a great question

377
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
That was like any 18

378
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
You're old

379
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
Young man

380
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:44,767
Invincible thought I was quite the ladies man you name it I mean

381
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,607
He made it into Lambda Chi Alpha at Oklahoma State

382
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,679
He was living at frat house

383
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:58,079
Arab attorney was primarily made up of wrestlers so was when you went down the hall

384
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:03,967
You're about to be taken down at any moment you be thrown into the wall

385
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
You leave a body print

386
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,111
What do you mean like an indentation literally in the wall or like

387
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,903
It was

388
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,207
There's amazing

389
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,863
There was a lot of partying going on

390
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,935
Lot of beer yard would be filled with beer cans

391
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:28,543
And here's the key if they wanted to get all that beer

392
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
They had to enlist the help

393
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
Of the lady you know the sorority sisters yes you would have a female buy you a beer and

394
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Can go out and

395
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,599
Party they need women to buy beer

396
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Why because in Oklahoma

397
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,975
State at the time, had a very silly

398
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,071
Girls could buy beer at age 18 but

399
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:51,839
Boys had

400
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Wait until

401
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,423
21 was something about

402
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,287
The level of maturity I guess for women versus men at that time the basic principle was that

403
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,127
Boy got into more car accidents so

404
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663
They should be trusted with

405
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
Blessed beer

406
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,759
Did that make you angry

407
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,343
Well I was extremely unfair I would say

408
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:16,159
It made I think most men angry at the time

409
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
And a Supreme Court case

410
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
Was born

411
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
So the thirsty

412
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Cboys

413
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,936
I brought this

414
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,264
To the RBG RBG gets involved in this

415
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Beer case

416
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:37,408
Yes but this is this is a this is a situation where women have rights men don't

417
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,456
Why would she want

418
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,248
Argue this case

419
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,528
Matcha tea want the opposite

420
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
This is

421
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Where

422
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,136
Chris strategy is

423
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Kind of like

424
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
A trojan horse

425
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,256
You look at this case right on the outside

426
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
It looks like

427
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,096
A case about men being discriminated

428
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
But

429
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
If you think about it

430
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,496
Beneath that discrimination is actually this

431
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
Unspoken idea

432
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
About women

433
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,872
So go with me on this rated men

434
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
Are irresponsible they can't handle beer then women girls are more responsible and well

435
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
I'll behave

436
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,672
More delicate they could be trusted with something like beer cuz they won't abuse

437
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
You know so

438
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,000
With that line of thinking

439
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,048
It's not long before you're

440
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Women

441
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
Them from

442
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,424
You know scary places like

443
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,264
Bars or courtroom score

444
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,800
Political office

445
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,848
Using this case

446
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:45,760
RBG is able to walk into the court this discrimination about men but also the discrimination against women that's

447
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
Attached to it

448
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,368
In or inside of it

449
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
That's clever

450
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
We're just getting started

451
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,504
More perfect continues intimate

452
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,888
This is my perfect I'm Jedi boom Rod here with Julia Longoria

453
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
Who's telling us the story of

454
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:42,080
A case involving boys and beer that became a kind of Trojan Horse

455
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,896
In the battle for women's rights

456
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:51,808
Know the story of the Trojan Horse maybe you know this it's you know ancient Greece

457
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:56,416
You got Sparta fighting Troy the Spartans want to get into the city of Troy

458
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,464
Giant wall City

459
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,256
Too big they can't get in

460
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,328
And so Odysseus comes up with his clever plan

461
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,632
Give the Trojans this giant wooden horse

462
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
They'll bring it to the city

463
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:10,240
Don't think it's a gift that we're retreating

464
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,776
What they thought

465
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
And then at night

466
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:19,456
Are soldiers were hidden inside the horse will come out

467
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
And they will take the city

468
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
In our case

469
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,648
Odysseus is is RBG

470
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,696
She said she's trying to get into is the Old Mills

471
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Court

472
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
What

473
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
In order for this

474
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
Very

475
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,120
Admittedly imperfect

476
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,960
We need someone in the horse to come out the warrior in the horse the woman warrior

477
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
And

478
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
In our case

479
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
That woman warrior

480
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
She didn't even know she was going to go into battle

481
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,760
Julia you take from here so

482
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
I got in the car

483
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
And I drove

484
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,392
A long-time tiny little gravel

485
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
Road

486
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,464
Waiting up to

487
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Narrow Street

488
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
Houses

489
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
2

490
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,816
Sparta North Carolina

491
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,936
Scott Sparta thousand horses and Trump sign

492
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,776
Tractor up

493
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:24,736
And so I walk up to this house it's this beautiful cream colored Cottage perched on top of amount

494
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,808
And I come here

495
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,392
Whitney Houston Saving All My Love For You blasting

496
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
I know I didn't

497
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
You Caroline

498
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:37,536
Very nice to meet you and I meet

499
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
What up what

500
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,608
Carolyn whitener

501
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
6

502
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,912
Simbi 77

503
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,936
She

504
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,568
Immediately offers me a course

505
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,200
Will you have a beer with me

506
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,760
No I can't I'm a diabetic

507
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,808
I can drink a little but not much

508
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:06,976
What does she look like describe her reddish blonde hair green eyes

509
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,512
Wrinkled and hoops

510
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,304
She has like this

511
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:15,168
This air about her that she could have been a beauty queen you know

512
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,008
But she also could have been a car mechanic

513
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:25,920
So we get to talkin I thought a little bit about who I am about the story

514
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,992
She actually told me like a French Lick

515
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:33,600
I'm proud of the young women I have a granddaughter that I'm so proud of you

516
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:38,208
Your generation they're finishing the fight I started and I was essentially like

517
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,744
No no no no

518
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,816
Stop like your story has like a huge impact on like

519
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
Women like me you know

520
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,168
Henry imagine

521
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,776
Embassy my name was never tied in with it

522
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,824
Was always Craig's name

523
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,104
So

524
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,664
You know it wasn't that big a deal

525
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,272
She told me she grew up bouncing around different oil field

526
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:04,320
How tall is Arnold field trash

527
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,416
That's what we were called oilfield trash

528
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:14,816
Battement Carolina and her brother and sister split the school year between two or three schools a year removed

529
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:21,216
Jesus school didn't come easily to her but my dad he taught all three of us had a whale he was a welder how to work

530
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:27,616
Work on a car is there a dependent when she was about 13 they moved to Chickasha Oklahoma

531
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
Indianola

532
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
Is where she met

533
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,344
Dwayne that was the first boy I went with they met in high school

534
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,648
And they were roughly the same age but he was

535
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,184
3 years ahead of her at school

536
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,232
And know what attracted you to him

537
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
His mind

538
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,584
He had an excellent mind

539
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
And he was just a farm boy

540
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,216
With no education he never went to college

541
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,520
He could have been about

542
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,848
Anything you don't want to do it then what do you think attracted

543
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,688
Him to you like what do you think he saw in you

544
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,736
I was somebody new in town

545
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
Talking to Carolina I got to send

546
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
She did not have any shortage of

547
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:13,696
Suitors betta when turned 18

548
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
Turn that off

549
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,888
And when I married

550
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,192
My husband

551
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:30,336
I was equal to him except the money and he didn't think anybody could handle that but him

552
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:34,432
He acted like he was Raising me and he probably was

553
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,296
She says she was really comfortable with him he was a quiet man with the

554
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
Brilliant mind

555
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
But

556
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
He just what he was pure German girl

557
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,976
Have you ever met a German man

558
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,304
Okay they are in total control

559
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:55,424
And how does Carolyn connect to the case with the Frat Boys in RBG

560
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
Okay so here's what happened

561
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,496
It's 1962

562
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,824
Carolyn and Duane are about 20 years old at this point

563
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,896
They moved to a town called Stillwater Oklahoma

564
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
Open a business

565
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,296
Stillwater

566
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,344
Is a college town

567
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,744
Black college Towngate got Oklahoma State University right there tons of fraternities including Lambda

568
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
Method wrestlers

569
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,400
Huge homecoming drawing over 40000 alumni we didn't know what homecoming was

570
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,496
Had no idea what homecoming was but shortly after moving to Stillwater

571
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
They open the doors

572
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:38,688
To the honk and holler and where we went in

573
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,968
Was just about

574
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,272
Three blocks poor blocks from the college

575
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,320
And we went into business there

576
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:50,208
A drive-through convenience store is like the real old gas station with oil.

577
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
In the floor here that would work

578
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,536
Customers pull up

579
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,864
To the side of the convenience store and the drive-thru

580
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
Honk their horn

581
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,984
Holler their order and you'd have to go out

582
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,080
And why don't them come back in and get what they wanted and take it back out

583
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,920
Soda in and out and in and out

584
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
All night long

585
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,296
You wear tennis shoes out real fast

586
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,088
It was all

587
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,880
Cheer Energy and guts

588
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:23,488
Homecoming night we were supposed to close at 11 the store is flooded with

589
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,512
Customers

590
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,280
Tell

591
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,048
I think

592
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,424
Two or three in the morning they're like thrilled because they've never run a business by themselves before

593
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,752
And all these college kids are coming in and buying Coors beer

594
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
Including of course

595
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,616
A steady stream of girls buying beer

596
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
Presumably for their boyfriend

597
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,968
And it Al I never did get to see homecoming

598
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,296
I saw was cars coming in and out

599
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
Fast forward a few years

600
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
1972

601
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,184
Back at the University at all

602
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:58,816
Had long blonde hair Curtis Craig's buddy named Mark Walker

603
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:05,216
The time is it a political science class and the professor starts talking about the whole fight for the era

604
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,776
Which is happening right at that moment

605
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,360
And at this point Oklahoma hasn't ratified the era

606
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,176
Somehow the conversation turns to

607
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,200
Gearlock

608
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
MRSA

609
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,784
Talk about discrimination this beer law

610
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
Is discrimination against.

611
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:25,952
And the professor challenged him about doing something about the beer laws if he was going to complain about

612
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:29,024
The one day I was behind the counter

613
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,888
People coming in and out Mark Walker walks into the honk and holler so young man

614
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
Came in to talk to me

615
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
She doesn't really have time to talk

616
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
She's running in and out but

617
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:44,896
They stood there waiting patiently I bet he was in there for hours and it was looking at the beer license

618
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,432
You looked at the license

619
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,224
A nurse is that Caroline's name

620
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
Is the one on it

621
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:54,112
Because actually my husband lost his license after he sold beer to a young man

622
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:54,880
So

623
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,416
He put them in my name

624
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Anyway

625
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,208
At a certain point

626
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,536
In between all the hunks and hollers he asked me

627
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,096
What I thought about the beer laws

628
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,632
And I told him

629
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
I was very vocal about it

630
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,824
I always had been she says it doesn't make any sense we send these young men off to war we're being drafted at 18

631
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,872
We don't let them drink beer when they come back

632
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
Was that just

633
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:23,040
At The Mention the liability issues you have these 18 year old girls coming in buying beer slipping into their boyfriends

634
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
How am I supposed to stop at

635
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
Your you can't

636
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,368
True

637
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
Who buys what

638
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,488
So eventually when Mark Walker ask for her help he

639
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Said he was

640
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,560
Going to do a term paper be like

641
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,376
Sure why not I was always willing to help them

642
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Because they had helped us

643
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
Get started

644
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,264
And I still thought it was a term paper

645
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,800
So was he

646
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,104
Not being completely honest with you then

647
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:50,176
Well I didn't hear half of what he said

648
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,480
I was busy every time he came in

649
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,528
So you know

650
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,088
It wasn't that important at the time

651
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,624
So I didn't think any more about it

652
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
He left

653
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
My husband was gone

654
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,488
He was out of state working

655
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,096
And I knew I didn't even say anything to him about it it wasn't important

656
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,400
You know I just thought it was a conversation

657
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
But it wasn't just a Converse

658
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,776
Because before that meeting mark

659
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
Had gone out

660
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
Looking for a lawyer

661
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
That's correct

662
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,152
And Curtis and Mark and the other frat brothers

663
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:25,760
I tried to reach the money that was flawed in a campus town

664
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
Her body

665
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,344
Use their last dollar for that last beer

666
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,672
But they managed to find this lawyer who would do it on the cheap

667
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:37,792
Alright well I'm just bread yogurt Attorney-at-Law no big signal no big deal

668
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:44,192
Remember I'm always wearing his military boots actually I believe you warm even to the Supreme Court

669
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:47,008
Fred had worked on another male discrimination case

670
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
In the past

671
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:53,152
This case was pretty straightforward

672
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:57,760
Most irresponsible and drunken woman in the state could buy it and unlimited

673
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,296
Quantities that 18

674
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
Well that was discrimination

675
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,904
What kind of Mora male rights case

676
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
What was

677
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,256
And do you remember corresponding with Ruth

678
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

679
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,656
Ruth Bader Ginsburg before she was on the court

680
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
Somehow

681
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,472
Ruth Bader Ginsburg noticed

682
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
And she watched

683
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,824
As Fred made his way up the courts

684
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
Losing at every level

685
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,992
And by this point Ruth Bader Ginsburg was head of the women's rights project at the ACLU

686
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
She already argued a few cases

687
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,320
Is before The Supreme Court

688
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,112
Which had changed the court

689
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
Slowly

690
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,928
For the idea that sex

691
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,952
Was like race

692
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,744
And she thought that this case

693
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
With interest

694
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,840
She gave her to call a problem

695
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
Interpersonal relationship

696
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
There's no question

697
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:50,752
I was something of an unreconstructed male chauvinist

698
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
So she was not

699
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,592
Fred did not see this as a women's rights

700
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:59,712
We're just kind of an unnecessary insult the man for no reason at all

701
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
Looking at this case.

702
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
No Fred

703
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
It's more than that

704
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
It didn't matter to her

705
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,392
If the plaintiff was a man or a woman

706
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
Because in most of those cases

707
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:15,584
The discrimination against the man was derivative of a prior and worst discrimination against the woman

708
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
Here's to the ladies

709
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
The bear and the week

710
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
How do they do it

711
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
Where do I find all that energy

712
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,104
That's seemingly inexhaustible store of pets

713
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Ginger

714
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
Again

715
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:33,504
Bruce was after the stereotype about women that was nestled inside the fear loss

716
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,808
That women are more responsible

717
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,088
And well-behaved

718
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:42,208
But in order for her to make that connection she needed Fred to write his brief

719
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,744
In a way that would be useful to her

720
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,072
So prefer not just to male discrimination

721
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:49,888
But discrimination based on gender

722
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
Well

723
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
I supported her

724
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
I just never was

725
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,312
Shall we say a militant feminist

726
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,872
Ruth had her work cut out for her

727
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,712
She was getting used to dealing with these roaches from the sticks

728
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:08,576
So with other local lawyers that she'd worked with in the past Ruth have been more forceful

729
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,624
Insisting that she make the argument

730
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
But that had backfired

731
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,976
So she likes like okay you argue it right

732
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,512
She wrote The Fred telling him that

733
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,840
She didn't need to be the one to present oral argument before the court

734
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,632
She was fine if he do it

735
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,472
But she very gently very persistently

736
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,312
Was able to convince him to let her help him with his legal brief

737
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
Betta

738
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,896
I think it was a

739
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:39,552
Couple months later cuz my husband was out-of-state every month meanwhile back at the honk and holler Carolyn has no eyes

740
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Idea what's going on

741
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,368
No no ID

742
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
And I got a phone call

743
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
My husband was on the phone

744
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,304
Well I have salesman in and I had people coming in and out

745
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
And

746
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,608
He was

747
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,632
I right

748
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
He was

749
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
Furious

750
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,008
I couldn't figure out what was going on

751
00:36:59,264 --> 00:36:59,776
Choose like

752
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:03,616
Case reading about well he had picked up a newspaper

753
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,688
In North Carolina in a bank

754
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,760
And it was on the front page of the newspaper

755
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
With my name and

756
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,088
About us soon

757
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:20,000
It look like we sued everybody in the state of Oklahoma that was an office all way down to the

758
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:26,400
Garbage man he's like what did you do how are you we don't want to get mixed up in this we don't want her name on this one.

759
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:32,800
I want to make a fuss like this could hurt business like how dare you you know I didn't know what happened I really didn't

760
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,384
No eventually she figured out it must have been that kid came in

761
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,456
And now it's like at the Supreme Court

762
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:45,856
What I was back and forth on that phone with him trying to wait on customers and I bet that

763
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:52,256
Took about 3 hours and he would not let up on me and he kept calling back and call him back he called Allah

764
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,304
Lawyer he was mad

765
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:00,960
And then the last phone call he said I am flying back in and he said you pick me up

766
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,008
Couple nights later

767
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
Drove to the airport

768
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
Picked him up

769
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
Anna

770
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,896
He was still mad

771
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
That was the longest

772
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,528
Car ride

773
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
As they grow back

774
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
She says he just

775
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
Lectured her

776
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
The whole ride I just listened to him

777
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
What did he say

778
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,560
I don't know what he said word to word

779
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,632
Yeah I just know he was strong with what he said

780
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,544
With my husband it was best to just be silent

781
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,664
I was never afraid of him

782
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
But

783
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
I knew how far to push it

784
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:52,160
Tommy got from the airport to the other side it was about an hour and 20 minutes

785
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,720
That's a long an hour and 20 minutes in the car

786
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
Where you can't get out

787
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,120
And over the course of that hour and 20 minutes

788
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
She said something in her

789
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
Kind of shifted

790
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,032
And at a certain point she

791
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,336
Basically turned to him and was like

792
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
No

793
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,200
Like I know you want me to drop this case

794
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,784
But I'm going to fight this out he threatened me Every Witch Way

795
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,064
I didn't budge

796
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
And probably

797
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,160
The reason why I didn't budge

798
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:26,464
Because he fought me so hard on it

799
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
You know I believed in it

800
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:34,400
That I had never stepped out like that that's the first time I really

801
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,216
Put my foot down and didn't budge

802
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,568
I gave so much to him

803
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
I mean

804
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,920
I didn't get a salary for 25 years

805
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,712
I didn't ask

806
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,552
I figured we were equal

807
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,368
I figured I work the same hours he did

808
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
And I figured I stood

809
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,256
Deciding not behind him and not in front of him

810
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,352
October 5th 1976

811
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888
Day of oral arguments

812
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,776
The lawyer Fred Gilbert across very many people that I didn't care for him I didn't care for

813
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,568
He was so

814
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,336
Pushy

815
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
Insist

816
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,896
That Carolyn needs to come to these

817
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,712
I didn't have the money to go and I didn't want to go

818
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:24,576
I never traveled anywhere by myself what I recall that day Curtis crack came to

819
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,112
I was dressed up

820
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,928
Student I had borrowed address

821
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:35,328
Plastic look like leather walking up those stairs high heels I remember that distinctly

822
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,192
So big beautiful building felt like I was walking forever up those stairs

823
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,264
I was burning up I was sweating

824
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:50,176
Will hear arguments next to the 75628 Craig against foreign

825
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,272
Whenever you're ready

826
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,064
Fred Gilbert starts things off

827
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,392
Keep box up to the podium in his combat boots

828
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,952
Ron Darling

829
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,560
Even though

830
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:09,632
Most alcoholic most immature

831
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
Mosto

832
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,984
I purchase 3.2% beer at age 18

833
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,520
Absolutely unlimit

834
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,312
The law doesn't say it

835
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
But those words

836
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:21,664
And by all accounts

837
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,712
Didn't exactly kill it

838
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:32,672
The worst justices just kept hammering

839
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,488
Movies age backing track

840
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,816
Hammering

841
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:45,216
What is before the courts

842
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
Before the court

843
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:52,640
What's before the cord is your complaint Curtis was sitting beside me and I kept punching what does that mean

844
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,455
What are they talking about what does that mean he kept

845
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
Be quiet

846
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,855
Overall tell you

847
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:08,255
I didn't understand what they were doing

848
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
Challenge today was originally enacted

849
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:16,447
19 night but she says what caught her ear was a moment when Justice rehnquist when he called me

850
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,727
When you say we

851
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,311
You're referring to your client who is the tavern keeper

852
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,335
Saloonkeeper

853
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:31,039
Can you call me that in the Supreme Court I came so near standing up and corrected him and I've always will

854
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,343
Going to do this time I didn't

855
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
Technically

856
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,671
As arguments went on Fred did at least

857
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,463
Try to do the thing that Ruth wanted

858
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:43,327
Anything to be if you could pass a law saying

859
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,119
No negro will

860
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:51,775
Compare sex discrimination to race discrimination

861
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:55,871
The thing is you can't discriminate even for something like public safety

862
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:02,271
On the basis of certain criteria what is the court ever held the Discrimination of this sort is of the same class

863
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:04,319
Commission the basis of race

864
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:09,439
Got to this court has come very very I ask you a question has it ever held

865
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,719
No one has never held that it is

866
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,535
To be treated the same as race

867
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,839
To make a long story short

868
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,887
By the end of oral argument

869
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,935
Things are looking great

870
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,775
4 fret

871
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,615
1.2 even interrupt

872
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,151
A Supreme Court Justice

873
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
You don't do that

874
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
Supporting the denial of

875
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Beer too young

876
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
It just

877
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
Yeah

878
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,623
Wasn't happening

879
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,927
I don't have time for parting thought I thank you for your time

880
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,279
Well you win some you lose some

881
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Right

882
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
Ladies

883
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,351
What no no no

884
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,959
Here comes the craziest part of the story

885
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:57,055
Double trojan horse horse within a horse because

886
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,871
After the Fred Gilbert debacle

887
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,919
There was another case

888
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:07,551
At the Supreme Court that afternoon and it just so happened

889
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:11,647
35699 last night it was a case being argued

890
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,255
By none other than Ruth Bader

891
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:19,071
The plushie organize I've not forgotten how

892
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,679
To get that argued the same day that was on purpose yeah oh yeah

893
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,751
Cheney

894
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:34,175
She somehow managed to get herself in the port on another case on the same day so I couldn't confirm

895
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
That for sure

896
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:37,503
I don't even know how you would do that

897
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,551
But what I can tell you is that

898
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,319
She arranged

899
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,343
Picosecond

900
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,903
Because she knew there was probably a good chance that

901
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:46,463
Fred be completely incompetent lawyer

902
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,999
Was going to be

903
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
You know less than amazing

904
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:55,935
The court was asking him questions and he was completely incapable of answering so finally the court just went all nevermind and then one roof

905
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:01,311
Dornoch to argue her case they asked her about Gregory bar

906
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,591
Concrete involving

907
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,431
A law that would not permit males to make certain purchases of females

908
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,223
Discrimination

909
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
Yes mam

910
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:13,343
My question is whether we should examine

911
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,695
Discrimination against

912
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,999
In part because such a loss

913
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,023
Insidious impact

914
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,351
And then she told Justice Stevens

915
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
Even in this case

916
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:28,447
It seems like men are the ones who are being

917
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
Discriminated against

918
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:33,311
Beneath that discrimination is a more Insidious 1

919
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:39,711
Compliance safety

920
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
Discrimination against female

921
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,319
Is it your view that there is no discrimination

922
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,879
I think there is

923
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,647
Discrimination

924
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:00,447
That almost every discrimination that operate against males operate

925
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,495
Against females as well

926
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,775
Is that a yes or a no

927
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,871
I just don't understand you and I are you trying to avoid the question

928
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
I'm trying to

929
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,735
Clarify the position

930
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,295
But I don't know of any line that doesn't

931
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,319
It doesn't work as a

932
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,879
They go back and forth a bit

933
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,671
Justice Stevens is basically like

934
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:22,719
Why do you keep insisting on this

935
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,487
Why do you keep

936
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,023
Saying that discrimination

937
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:29,119
Against men contains within it discrimination against women

938
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Are different

939
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
Would you like no they're not there

940
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,055
Is it discrimination against

941
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,871
My case depends on your recognition

942
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:40,895
That

943
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,711
Using gender

944
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
Resorting to. Classify

945
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,575
Scotty questionable

946
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
And should be

947
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:50,623
Closely

948
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
Reviews

949
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,439
Makes this point again and again

950
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,255
All discrimination based on gender is bad

951
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:01,119
Must be checked with something at least approaching that hard core standard

952
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,655
At the court uses for race

953
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,959
That was really something

954
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,007
Seeing this little woman

955
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,543
Get up

956
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,591
Purely a Gmail discrimination

957
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:15,199
I'll never forget that because she was small

958
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,295
Yes she's so small in person

959
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,319
The chi

960
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,367
Had a lot of force

961
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
About

962
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,279
2 months later

963
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,351
December 20th 1976

964
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,119
Craig

965
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,167
Against

966
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,983
Justice William Brennan announces that the court

967
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,079
Is breaking down the beer law

968
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,895
We hold that Oklahoma's gender-based

969
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,919
Differential

970
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,199
Doves Cry

971
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,247
An invidious violation

972
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:53,599
Best silly beer case

973
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:57,439
Was basically the first time the court clearly said

974
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,999
That when you discriminate based on gender

975
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,279
You need to pass

976
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
Harder test

977
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,399
It wasn't as rigorous as race it wasn't

978
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Strict

979
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:07,935
Scrutiny

980
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,239
They settled on a standard that we now call

981
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
Intermediate scrutiny

982
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:13,823
And it was pretty damn close

983
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,991
RBG would go on to strengthen the standard overtime

984
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,783
But this was the case

985
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,855
That first got us

986
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,647
Kind of Equal Rights Amendment

987
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
Suicide door

988
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,463
We wish that the

989
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,767
Arrest protocol

990
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,327
Make that announcement

991
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,375
But of course we

992
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,679
Very pleased that

993
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
After that

994
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
The day the decision was announced

995
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,079
I had just came in from work I was at home

996
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:48,895
By myself here in Stillwater she's by herself

997
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,663
In the kitchen

998
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
In the phone rings

999
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711
Can you call

1000
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Call

1001
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
National news

1002
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,855
Call to tell me that

1003
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,135
We had one

1004
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
I didn't ask

1005
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,975
What we had one

1006
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,791
I didn't ask anything

1007
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,839
I just said okay

1008
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:15,007
She hung up dude there for a little bit and then Craig called and he wanted me to come down and celebrate with the guys they are his

1009
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
Fraternity

1010
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,055
Eternity

1011
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,591
She told them

1012
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
No thanks

1013
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,919
And then she hangs up the phone

1014
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:25,759
Did you get the one more phone call and it was my husband he was in

1015
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
North

1016
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,319
Caroline again

1017
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,855
And he heard

1018
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:33,439
He heard something about the case but he didn't hear it all

1019
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:37,279
And he said what's going on now and I said

1020
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
We won

1021
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:39,839
And he says

1022
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,887
Is it over I said is over

1023
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,959
It's totally over with

1024
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,239
He said good

1025
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,287
And he hung up

1026
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,871
I fix me a very

1027
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
Good

1028
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,431
Drink vodka and Coke

1029
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,015
Sit down the middle of the floor and that's the way I celebrated

1030
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:02,367
I drank that drank all by myself and it was over with

1031
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,647
It was over with

1032
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,535
Caroline says that

1033
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Decades

1034
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
After this case

1035
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,167
She didn't understand what it meant

1036
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,215
She didn't understand

1037
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:23,103
Is it legal principle or that it ushered in this new era for women in this country

1038
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,175
But even so

1039
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:27,967
In

1040
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,991
Her own life

1041
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
This case

1042
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,855
Was it beginning

1043
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:39,231
Play a couple of years after we won that case

1044
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,023
I went into China

1045
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,071
Right after it opened up

1046
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,631
She saved up money and went with her sister-in-law

1047
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:46,911
Dwayne didn't want to come

1048
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:50,495
I did I would ever so curious

1049
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,567
And we never went like the tourist went

1050
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,919
We get on a train and if we saw something we wanted to stop and see

1051
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,943
We would stop

1052
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,503
We never had a schedule

1053
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:07,135
And I never did really go to shop I was just curious about the people

1054
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,671
And how they lived

1055
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,951
That's so so much

1056
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,535
And I talked to so many people while I was gone

1057
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,071
That

1058
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,119
It was like a hunger

1059
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,031
And you grow from it

1060
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,383
And I just wanted to see things

1061
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,711
And that was just open it just open the doors for me

1062
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
What happened to Caroline in the

1063
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,407
Xi'an Duane divorce in mm

1064
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,503
And and when you and when you said she didn't know

1065
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,039
Defector KSAT

1066
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,599
For decades like when did she figure it out or what

1067
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,879
What what how

1068
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:43,903
So

1069
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:50,303
In 1996 this professor guy named Bob Darcy called her up and invite her to speak at

1070
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
A class

1071
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,863
And

1072
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,447
She is kind of learning from the students than from the

1073
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
The professor

1074
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,239
Like what the key sack

1075
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,263
Actually stood for

1076
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,311
And then eventually the professor puts her

1077
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:03,103
In touch with Ruth Bader Ginsburg

1078
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
Again

1079
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,175
In person

1080
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,455
And

1081
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,015
Sort of starts to. On her

1082
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,575
One of the letters

1083
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,367
I don't know if that's the one

1084
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,927
When were sitting in her bedroom

1085
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
She was looking through some old letters

1086
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:21,279
Then pulled out one with the Supreme Court

1087
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Still on it

1088
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,583
Can you read it

1089
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:29,983
No I don't have my glasses you'll have to read the cashier caroling as I told you in 1996 and we celebrated the 20th anniversary

1090

You are the true heroine of that case

1093
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:39,711
Although no financial gain was at stake for you you realize the potential the case had in Paving the way

1094
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:44,063
For the Court's recognition of equal citizenship stature of men and women

1095
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,855
A constitutional principle

1096
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,719
How about I was going to get that

1097
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,487
Framed

1098
