00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,336
I can hear you

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
Do you want

00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
Who's your team

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,528
I root for Michigan

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
Because

8
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,560
Harvard in the sports bar without getting beat up

9
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:41,216
Killers different tears right

10
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,776
KU and Duke and bright

11
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:48,128
This is my private game chat voices are Susie lechtenberg more

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,408
Sexy producer

00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,432
Uninstall

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
Legal editor

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,528
Okay so we made an album this season

16
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
West Branch musicians to interpret the

17
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,904
27 amendments to the US Constitution

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,184
On the podcast

19
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,768
We're telling stories about those amendments stories about why they matter

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,304
Aquila audio liner notes

21
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,584
To the song

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,144
Now the 13th Amendment 13th Amendment

23
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,680
Abolition of slavery

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Is one of our most

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Important

26
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,032
Please put in right after the Civil War 2

27
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,568
Put it into this National

28
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
Trauma

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
Of slavery

30
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,992
That right did its job back

31
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,528
65 and now it's kind of dormant

32
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Right

33
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,600
Not exact

34
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,952
There is this little matter of the NCAA

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,768
Should we tell people what NCAA stands for

36
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
Susie Nelly take it from here

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,144
The NCAA is the National Collegiate

38
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
National Collegiate athletic

39
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,008
It is the governing body

40
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
For college

41
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
All of them is the Men's Track and Field Championship day 1 It's the final day of a division 1

42
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,016
Men's swimming and Diving championships

43
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:04,416
Wrestling Championships women's fencing championships in volleyball championship

44
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,256
From soccer to rowing to water polo to gymnastics

45
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
The revenue-generating one

46
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
AR

47
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,680
College football

48
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
Time to settle

49
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
The madness

50
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
And Men called.

51
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,080
How much money did they bring in

52
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
1.1 billion

53
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
And how much the players make

54
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
The players make $0

55
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,504
And zero cents

56
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
Volleyball

57
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,112
You may have heard of all this

58
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:40,512
It's been covered quite a bit

59
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,400
It really left into a lot of people's Consciousness back in 2014 when this guy Shabazz Napier

60
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,472
Who was the star player for the University of Connecticut said

61
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
During an interview

62
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:55,104
I go to bed and I'm starving

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,640
He didn't have enough money to eat

64
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,456
And this was just a few days before

65
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,368
Keeping score 22 points and Lead UConn to win the national championship

66
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,928
Neuropathy feel like

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,744
You want something in return

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
For all of this

69
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Is Eric

70
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:25,056
There are not what some people arguing

71
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,872
Because the ideal of the traditional ideal

72
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,456
Or that people play for the love of the sport

73
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
And not for financial

74
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,320
And this was somehow spoil that somehow

75
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Paying them enough to eat

76
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Would spoil

77
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,512
Now interestingly if you survey people on this issue which we did

78
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,840
Hand washing posters alphabet I think that they should get paid

79
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:54,240
How much do you get paid

80
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
I definitely feel like you should get paid job and you're a student you have to be full-time as well so that's

81
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,968
Bessie two full-time jobs

82
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:06,784
They still profit margin on them is way too high

83
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
What you'll find is that

84
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,208
A majority of black people who are surveyed

85
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:22,655
On the other hand you think I should get paid no absolutely not how come

86
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,519
Because they're college students will find that most white people about

87
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,543
6 out of 10

88
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
Jose

89
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
No

90
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:34,431
I kind of believe they are getting paid by Guinea scholarship

91
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,015
I think if they're on a full scholarship that's

92
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
A lot more pay then

93
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Any other

94
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
College

95
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
Kid Whatever Gets you

96
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,975
I really really don't think so

97
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
Ellie again

98
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
All of what my head always goes back to is

99
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,191
There's a lot of this conversation that should have been settled

100
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
And it should have been settled

101
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,567
In 1865

102
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
When we pass the 13th amend

103
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
13th Amendment

104
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
Abolition of slavery

105
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,735
Neither slavery

106
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
Nor involuntary servitude

107
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:15,391
Except as a punishment for Crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted

108
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Shall exist

109
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
Within the United States

110
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,767
Any place subject to their jurisdiction

111
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:25,119
Okay so what does NCAA basketball have to do with the 13th Amendment

112
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,983
Well the 13th amendment was ratified after the end of the Civil War it abolished

113
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
Slavery involuntary servitude

114
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
But there's

115
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Sort of disastrous

116
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
That says

117
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,199
Except as a punishment for Crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted

118
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,783
Involuntary servitude is okay if you are in prison

119
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,415
This is why states can use prisoners to build roads and fight fires and do all kinds of things

120
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
And not have to come

121
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:57,631
And believe it or not this is what the NCAA indirectly cited as a way to defend their practice

122
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
Back in 2016

123
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
2 Penn State runners

124
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,799
Sue the NCAA saying they should get paid

125
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,639
The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals came back with a verdict saying no

126
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
They don't have to pay you

127
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,015
In the reasoning the judge appointed to a case about prisoners not getting paid

128
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Because of the 13th amend

129
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Understandably

130
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,671
This comparison between NCAA athlete

131
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
In prisoners

132
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Made a lot of people

133
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
Bentley has a racial overtone

134
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
Because we're not talking about this in hockey

135
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
And baseball nowicki

136
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
Conveniently having this conversation

137
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,983
About the two sports in particular

138
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,519
Basketball and football

139
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
That are predominantly black

140
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,663
Including former NCAA players

141
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
Who have gone pro

142
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
And how the contracts are

143
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
Basically struct

144
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:50,367
You know they were indentured servants contract isn't totalscan the fact it is

145
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
The fact that their nonprofit organization

146
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,255
Business model based on the plantation business model

147
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
My grandfather

148
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
Grew up on a plantation

149
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,095
So if I'm not

150
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:00,863
People know what that is

151
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,935
But the promise of the plantation was that next year will get better

152
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Will never let you see the book

153
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,239
Will never let you

154
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,519
See how much cotton you pick

155
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
This is just how much it worth

156
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
Speaking to the great Bill Russell

157
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
We had a conversation in

158
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
Beijing music college and slavery

159
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
I just really dislike this

160
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
Which I understand

161
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
What people

162
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
Echo Janka law professor at Cardozo

163
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:26,463
Michigan fan first thing my children more when they were

164
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
Michigan one

165
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Can all sing the fight song

166
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
4

167
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Echo says

168
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
Look it up

169
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
So the connection

170
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,191
Ford labor law

171
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,567
This analogy that college athletes are two colleges as prisoners are

172
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
Prisons is

173
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Unfortunately

174
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
Unfortunately then

175
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:49,759
But all that's really being said is that these students are not employees

176
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
No one was calling athletes

177
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,599
Indentured servants or

178
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
Play in the NCAA

179
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Deeply broke

180
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
There's a casual cheap

181
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,559
Nest to the way in which people toss around

182
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,119
This is like slavery that is like slavery

183
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
In ways I thought

184
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
Think Ashley devalues Yagami

185
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Alside

186
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
Did you just makes my skin crawl

187
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
I'm with

188
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
They're not

189
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,335
Chattel slavery

190
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,919
Was a horrible thing Ellie again

191
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
Having two

192
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
Play for Nick Saban is not the same

193
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
I get it

194
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
One of the things

195
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
That bothers me

196
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
About

197
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,903
13th Amendment conversate

198
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Is that

199
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
There is a

200
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,023
There is a desire

201
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
Certain people

202
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,583
2

203
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,119
Look at the 13th Amendment

204
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
Hang up

205
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Mission accomplished Banner

206
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,031
And and then consignment

207
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
Hope slavery was bad

208
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
Fix that

209
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
And we're done

210
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
No

211
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,967
That's not what the 13

212
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,783
18th amendment was about that's not what it was ever intended

213
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,343
The very first cases

214
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
About the

215
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
Talk not just about

216
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
Abolishing slavery

217
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,767
But about abolishing the

218
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
Incidence

219
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,303
Badges

220
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,119
On the 13th Amendment

221
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
Was a powerful

222
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Legal docs

223
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
That should have allowed

224
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,775
Congress to go in

225
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
Andrew Tout

226
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
Not just slavery but discrimination

227
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
And when I look at

228
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,199
The NCAA

229
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
What I see are the incidents

230
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
And badges

231
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,855
These players are in debt

232
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,647
Play

233
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
They must play

234
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:33,439
For free

235
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
They must play

236
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,487
Where they're told

237
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
They must play when they're told to play

238
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,631
On the backs of oh but you sign but you signed up for the scholarship

239
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
If they play poorly

240
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,055
I think this is important but

241
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,591
When I think about the badges

242
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:51,871
Slavery

243
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
I think about

244
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919
Parker prison

245
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
I think about that

246
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
Huge numbers of 1/2

247
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Into our

248
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,527
Proportionately

249
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Prison

250
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Arrested

251
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
I think about

252
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,415
The fact that people lack the right to vote those to me are the

253
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,183
Badge isn't it

254
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,839
Echo says he agrees with the overall Spirit of what Ellie and some of these athletes are saying

255
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,911
He just thinks we're looking in the wrong place if we focus on that

256
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,311
But it strikes me that what is really happening here

257
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
Isn't about the athlete

258
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,175
It's about a settler harder

259
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
What is our relationship to our past

260
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,879
Like the history that the 13th amendment was designed to solve

261
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
Is that history still with us

262
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,207
How much

263
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,071
Where is it right to point something and say we are the way we are because of that

264
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
Because of how we were

265
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Where is it a bridge too far

266
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,007
That conversation is going to be with us for a long time

267
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,055
Because

268
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
You know

269
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
At the very least it

270
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Comes around every March

271
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,783
Are you ready for some more

272
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,823

Okay on the album side of things we had

277
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
Two different artists

278
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,999
Who submitted songs for the 13th Amendment the 1st

279
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,047
Comes from brooklyn-based soul singer

280
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Bette Smith

281
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119

Cumsum rapper Kash Doll

286
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,615
2 minutes

287
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:16,671
Thanks to the 13th Amendment we thought this was

288
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:23,071
The one that would end it but we still her ass still mass incarceration so much for the emancipate

289
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:27,679
Patient Proclamation

290
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,007
Slavery is legal if you're convicted of a crime

291
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,079
Gwinnett crime that you committed probably don't fix the time

292
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
Have you build a ship for that sit and they pay you with dime a conspiracy they try to censor you when you speak

293
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:46,879
They can't hide behind the sheets on. They do you like me me while you take your chances out here trying to survive

294
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
Not a lot of pain since 1865 but still they try to teach you that everybody

295
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,679
Until you up for the same job as white people just don't want to be walking to the gate

296
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:06,079
Staying here United ready to fight for our freedom

297
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,479
That was Kash Doll with

298
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
13th Amendment

299
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,551
Genji noodle thing at the most

300
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
Perfect album. Org

301
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
I'm Jedi boom Rod will continue in a moment

302
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:28,351
This is my perfect time chat album ride this season we asked a bunch of different positions to

303
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Interpret

304
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
The 27 Amendments

305
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
The US Constitution which resulted

306
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
In an album

307
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,543
And a one of the great joys of that was watching all of these

308
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,311
These people

309
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
Take the stage e words

310
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
And

311
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Make

312
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:42,943
Personal

313
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,759
It's hell with that in mind

314
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,415
We did the lineup for the for the 13th Amendment here's his next one producer Julia Longoria

Tell me

317
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
The origin story of

318
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
Of your tweets

So

322
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,223
Recently my roommate and best friend

323
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
My name is Aaliyah Marie Alameda

324
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,039
Was on a quest

325
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,343
Troll me I left who annoy you

326
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,159
And ask if nauseous

327
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,463
Not only in private

328
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Butt in public

329
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,559
And privately I had asked you earlier

330
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,375
If you were stranded on an island with

331
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,399
3 Amendment

332
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
What three amendments would you

333
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:40,031
And he rolled your eyes and walked away for me

334
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Cement thinner

335
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,175
And see what ends up happening and I love this because

336
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
This project is created a lot of

337
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,063
Add conversations for all of us in our in our daily lives

338
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
But

339
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,855
Aaliyah ended up

340
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Tweeting

341
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
The question that the entire show

342
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
Like all my co-workers

343
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
They said

344
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,231
Julia

345
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,303
If you were to go on a date with an amendment

346
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
Which amendment would it be

347
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,679
Who's the lucky who's lucky Amendment

348
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
This is

349
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,775
This is classically aware she's just like talking

350
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,615
Stupid but she manages to hit the nail on the head

351
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Prairie like

352
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,735
What the whole season's about like we're taking you out on dates

353
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
With the amendment

354
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
You listen to the SEC

355
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,111
Sexy song you hear stories about them spend some

356
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
Time estimate question

357
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:34,047
Get to know them a little no pressure we're not making our long episodes about these things they're short

358
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,071
First Dates

359
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:35,839
Lithium

360
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,727
Okay so in your head like when you're writing this do you have an amendment in mind for you

361
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,519
I think I would do not

362
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:50,687
Yeah I'm probably more okay so 9 I'm going to pull up my phone really quickly

363
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
Distant like remember this

364
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,063
It says the enumeration in the Constitution

365
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,367
Petition of certain rights shall not be construed

366
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
To deny or disparage others retained by

367
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,791
People the ninth amendment is about the rights that we have that

368
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
Aren't necessarily listed in the Constitution

369
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
Esthetician

370
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
They call these

371
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
Number alright

372
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,983
And looked at one way

373
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
This amendment is about

374
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,311
Possibilities

375
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,711
Sota music The Nines is kind of like love at first sight or something or is it already like

376
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Evit like

377
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
The weird corners of

Of you that like you don't

379
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
No

380
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
Yeah you know Alexa

381
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
The tall dark

382
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Serious

383
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
Guy that like Ivan

384
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695

385
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,279
That's not like she's got like

386
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,839
I don't want to get gender to the amendments

387
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,423
But that's another can of worms

388
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,055
But I think this is where we differ on the 9th because I feel like it would be good for like a couple dates

389
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,871
I think when you get down to it it's like okay

390
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:58,271
Okay bro but like really what are you actually about me like you know they just like

391
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295

Do you have to you know we don't

397
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:15,167
I don't know what I want in my life like I don't know if I would marry 9

398
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,471
I don't know I know my dad would want me would have be like

399
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:21,311
With the Second Amendment that's the right to bear arms

400
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
Would you date 19

401
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Today date

402
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,687
Minion

403
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,503
19 of course is women's right to vote

404
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
Yeah I guess everything

405
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,343
I don't know

406
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
I feel like

407
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:40,511
That's another settling Amendment you know like all great like you treat women with her snack

408
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:44,351
It's like just the vote like

409
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
What amendment would you end up marrying you

410
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
The one the one right

411
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,543
The 14th Amendment

412
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
Citizenship rights

413
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Equal protection

414
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
Apportionment

415
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
Civil War.

416
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,735
All persons born or naturalized in the United States

417
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
And subject to the jurisdiction thereof

418
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,599
Are citizens of the United States

419
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,439
And of the state wherein they reside

420
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:16,095
The amendment that grants citizenship and equality equal protection of the law

421
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,631
Is all of the all the

422
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,983
The stuff you know like it it checks all the boxes but it just like

423
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:28,383
If it would just live up to its goddamn potential then maybe maybe we could do this cuz I mean you look at look at

424
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,431
The history of the 14th Amendment like

425
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,991
Japanese internment dude like

426
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
These people were born in the US are citizens why can't we seem to live by the the beautiful things in

427
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,999
In written right there in the Constitution 14th Amendment date

428
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279

Cellulite

Haley

431
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,351
Maybe you want to get

432
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
I don't think 14 but I would

433
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,871
I mean look at whatever. But equal protection of the laws

434
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
That's like

435
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
God damn like

436
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,527
I would marry that yeah if it would live up to its potential

437
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,551
Ina

438
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087

439
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855

440
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
Israel

441
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
They're so tight back

442
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,487
They don't solve all your problems they talk a big game

443
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:20,095
When push comes to shove do they show up looking for amendments

444
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,655
Still like tacos in at night that's not what they're going to do

445
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,423
There's not

446
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703

447
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
A lot of

448
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
Are you still holding out hope for the night

449
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,711
It's really love it it's so good

450
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
I want to be like

451
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,039
60 years old

452
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,111
On a rocking chair in a Florida room

453
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
I'm sitting with a Madman

454
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,671
And being like

455
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,951
Hey did I ever tell you

456
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
When I was

457
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
Little

458
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,559
And I want a minute to

459
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,327
Return to Sender

460
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
What

461
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,887
You've never told me that

462
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,655
Story this is

463
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,567
To see

464
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,015
More perfect Julia Longoria

465
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,807
With her pal Aaliyah Almeida

466
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,623
And before I go I just want to say that

467
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,792
This is really an introduction to the poem The One and Only poem on the album

468
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
From Sarah Kay

469
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,864
My name is Sarah Kay

470
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
And this poem

471
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,448
It was inspired by the Fourteenth Amendment and

472
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,496
Tell the story of her grandmother

473
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
Who was

474
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,544
Interned

475
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
During

476
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,104
World War II in Japanese

477
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
Internment camps

478
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
Even though she was

479
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
An American citizen

480
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
I think

481
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
I've been a lot of time now

482
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,600
Wondering what it means to pledge allegiance to a country

483
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
But does not pledge allegiance

484
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
To you

485
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,280
And that's what I what I think about when I think about

486
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
The 14th amend

487
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,168
You can listen to Sarah's poem at the most perfect album. Org

488
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
And that's it I'm out

489
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,800
The 14th Amendment change the way our constitution works

490
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,824
Took some time

491
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
But it overturned

492
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,200
The infamous Dred Scott decision and it was supposed to make black p

493
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,760
Full citizens of the United States

494
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
Over the years lawyers like

495
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,600
Thurgood Marshall

496
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
Who would become a Justice

497
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,416
Just and Ruth Bader Ginsburg

498
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
To become a Justice

499
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:27,328
They used it to fight for racial equality in gender equality and today that Fight Continues

500
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,400
With lgbtq people immigrants.

501
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Disabled

502
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
Countless others that

503
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
14th Amendment

504
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,520
Has become pivotal to those battles

505
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
But there was Battle

506
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,128
Obviously as we seen the news this week in fact

507
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
Continue

508
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:46,784
So I guess you could say a 450 years after it was ratified the 14th is still a work in progress

509
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
Steve

Wrote a song for us about the 15th Amendment

518
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,536

That's Nnamdi ogbonnaya

00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,784
With a song for the 15th Amendment

525
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,600
Musically the harmonies on that song with just bananas

526
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,184
And I'm amazed it how

527
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
Deeply research that song is

528
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:42,304
And actually that is kind of the kid the case for the second song that was

529
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
Met for a sabbatical

530
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:46,912

Thanks for listening

542
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:23,008
Hi my name is Aisha Burns and I wrote a song about the Fifteenth Amendment

543
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:43,488
Mission for the general tone and feel of the song

544
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:52,192
The complexity of the amendment and the context under which it was passed

545
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,992
Black Americans the right to vote

546
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:13,696
Super Violet really changes things and the first black man vote the day after the amendment is passed

547
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:26,496
Over 600 black men

548
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:31,616
Enjoying local state and federal legislative bodies

549
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,176
And there's a real sense of

550
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:40,576
Agency within the black community in this year's however by the end of the decade State start passing

551
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
Their own laws that

552
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,024
Practically nullify the 15th Amendment things like poll taxes and grandfather clause

553
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
2

554
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,376
The main challenge that I faced well

555
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:58,496
Well arranging the song was deciding how do I tell the story of

556
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:03,360
What at first maybe seems like this big moment of Triumph and Power

557
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,432
So this kind of eerie feeling

558
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,016
That lingers through the song that the same time

559
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:16,672
The vocals especially can you give this sense of having overcome something which I and I think both of those things are true

560
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:21,024
As a black American it felt really important to me too

561
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:28,192
To tell that story and it's full complexity
