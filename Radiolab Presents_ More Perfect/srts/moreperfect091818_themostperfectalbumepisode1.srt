Season 3

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,640
This season we're going to do something a little different than what was done in the past

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:24,576
Can you tell me how many amendments

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:30,720
No ma'am not gay

8
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,816
Coffee and I don't know I have no idea I'm guessing somewhere around 10

9
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,608
I would guess somewhere around

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,264
20 21 or 23 24 25

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,336
26

12
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,360
27

13
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,920
27

14
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,760
There are 27 Amendments

15
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,808
Did the United States Consul

16
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:00,928
This season we're going to focus

17
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464
On those words

18
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,792
Explain why

19
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,240
First of all the name Moore

20
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
The name of this podcast

21
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,544
Comes of course

22
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,872
From the preamble to the Constitution

23
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,920
In the reason we chose that name

24
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,040
A couple reasons me first of all it's a weird phrase

25
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,088
Can't really have something be more

26
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:29,856
Perfect

27
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
Because Perfect Isn't absolute

28
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,672
But beyond that

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,280
The phrase sort of gesture that this idea that America is

30
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
Constantly evolving

31
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
It's never done

32
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,728
They were always in the process of trying to drag ourselves out of the mud

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
And get to those higher ideals

34
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,056
Make ourselves

35
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
Moorpark

36
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
Be more perfect

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,664
Very often we don't make

38
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
Marriott

39
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
We're always

40
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,088
Trying and that is embodied in our founding

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,648
I mean we wrote this thing called the Constitution

42
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
And then we kept changing

43
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,560
Mending it adding a new rights filling in Holes

44
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
Where we fail so that we don't fail again

45
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,424
So far we've done that 27 times

46
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,776
The season were going to look at all 27 what do they mean why are they important

47
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
How do they hold us together

48
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,616
In these turbulent

49
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,432
* but the thing is when you read these amendments

50
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:31,296
The words themselves can feel very abstract very musty very far away

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
So

52
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
We decided to make an album

53
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,840
Actual album

54
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:56,640
In the spirit of Schoolhouse Rock

55
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
We reached out some the best

56
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,880
Best artist musicians around the world we asked them to make a song

57
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
About an amendment

58
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:13,536
Did the United States Constitution

59
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
No idea this was going to work

60
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,120
But we put out some calls

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
And we got all of these amazing artists

62
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264

00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
Why they matter too

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion

We're getting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press

95
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,351
The right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances

At New York University law school is like casually a big deal

115
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:47,551

I mean I someone who

118
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
Tries to enforce the Constitution for more than 50 years remember you saying that you've argued cases

119
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,839
Front of the Supreme Court right

120
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119

Waiting on the Supreme Court steps

125
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Okay so

126
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,527
One Summer

127
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,087
When he was just starting out as a professor

128
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
V 1996

129
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159

130
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,439
Who work for me

131
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,231
And she been with me for

132
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
4 years

133
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:32,095
I am one day she sent me a personal point I'm so tired

134
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,911
I was taking your handwritten draft

135
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Typing them up

136
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,103
And then having you giving you the typewritten version then you change it then I have to

137
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Retype it

138
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:46,687
Have you ever heard of this thing called a laptop

139
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,503
Cornell computer she basically says to him

140
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
You know crazy idea why don't you just learn how to type

141
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
We could make the changes much

142
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
After I wouldn't have to retype

143
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
What time and you find it much easier to work

144
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
I should know tools

145
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
I don't know

146
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
I never never learn to talk

147
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,471
Why can't I just can't do it let's just keep going I like writing by hand makes me think

148
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
She said well I'm going to do you a great favor

149
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
Said I'm not going to type your stuff anymore

150
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,407
You don't understand how it works I'm the boss you're the employee

151
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,807
I tell you what to do you like this if I tell you and she said no no no you don't understand I Know Who You Are

152
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:28,671
Learn how to use the computer it's the best present I can give you

153
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
So what do I do I do if my laptop

154
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,559
And I decided I would learn how to read how to use WordPress

155
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Twista

156
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,495
Program everybody

157
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,567
So what do I do I type out the Bill of Rights

158
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
That's the text I know best

159
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,439
To the Bill of Rights

160
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
Starts with this

161
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
Text

162
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,279
That basically says

163
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,303
We the states

164
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,607
We think that this constitution need some more

165
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,447
It doesn't do enough

166
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,007
To give the people rights

167
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
To protect them from

168
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
All of his power that the government has

169
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
So what we're going to do is

170
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Midget throwing

171
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
Extra rights

172
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
Is Extra Protection

173
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,295
That

174
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
We think really

175
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
Every American should have one of the things I wanted to do was figure out how to move

176
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,327
Who's text you know you highlight the text and then you can move it from one place to another

177
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
First practice

178
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
How to learn how to highlight text

179
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,983
And so I typed the Bill of Rights out all all 10 amendments

180
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,519
I'm in the next door

181
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
Practicing by highlighting

182
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:58,527
Portions of the text Congress shall make no law respecting the First Amendment to the right of trial

183
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
Aruba jewelry shopping

184

188
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
Every single time I move it around

189
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,031
Is something that tells me that it's

190
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,359
It's no it's it's there's something fundamentally

191
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
Florida

192
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
I thought well it's because you so used to

193
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
The old way

194
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:34,111
The new way is more than you know is it's something that you really can't process

195
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,207
But I realized I don't really look at it very much as a whole anyway

196
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
Ghetto been hard-pressed to tell you

197
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:45,887
Exactly what words came where I began to realize

198
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,911
That there is

199
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
Text that we have

200
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
The 10 amendments that we have

201
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:51,775
ADP

202
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Structure

203
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
The same kind of deep structure that you would find in a poem

204
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,687
Take for example the First Amendment

205
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
1st Amendment

206
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Freedom of religion

207
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
Beach Press

208
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
Assembly

209
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,111
Petition it consists of six idea

210
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,207
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion

211
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Or prohibiting the free x

212
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Exercise Theory

213
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,095
2 or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press

214
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
Or the right of the people peaceably

215
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Way to assemble

216
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
And to petition the government

217
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
For redress of

218
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
6

219
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
Could have been written on the back of an envelope

220
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,383
These days the first amendment is

221
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,431
Wrapped up in all kinds of

222
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,711
Thorny stuff like

223
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,271
Kneeling at football games and

224
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,831
Hate speech and money in politics

225
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
But if

226
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
You

227
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
Just step back

228
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
From all of that

229
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,767
And you read the text of the First Amendment

230
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,559
And you really try to think about

231
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
What the words are trying to say

232
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
You find that the logic behind it is

233
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
Kind of beautiful

234
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,311
The order of the words in the First Amendment

235
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,871
Is the life cycle of a democratic

236
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,991
Trinity means

237
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
So those first two clauses

238
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,415
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion

239
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
Or prohibiting the free exercise thereof

240
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
Create a free space

241
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
Inside your mind

242
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Believe as you wish

243
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
That's the founder saying

244
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,471
That space inside your head where you think your thoughts

245
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
That's sacred

246
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,663
The government can't touch that there can be no government so that's the first idea

247
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:40,063
The freedom of your thoughts once you believed

248
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:46,463
Don't want to say it which brings us to the next

249
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
Or abridging the freedom of speech Clause says if you got an idea

250
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:58,751
Why won't you go ahead and share it see you the freedom to

251
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,055
I think about the freedom to speak that thought

252
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:07,455
If you really want to make a real dent in

253
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,759
Do you need some way to be able to speak

254
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:16,671
Speak in a very loud voice which brings you to the 4th Place

255
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
The Press

256
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:24,095
Which is speech amplify

257
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,495
Once you gotten your message out to a large number of people when people would listen to these ideas and move

258
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,567
It's natural for those people

259
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,871
I want to do something about it

260
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
To move together

261
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:44,063
I'm too organized for the right of the people peaceably to assemble

262
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,647
So you can think of that even speak that.

263
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:54,047
You can create a movement but that's not why

264
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Which is the six

265
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:01,727
Idea a petition process

266
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,823
Web search

267
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,967
Twitter search you have a right to take your argument to the government and to petition the government

268
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:18,367
For a redress of grievances

269
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,415
Enforce the government

270
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,999
And either accepting or rejecting

271
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,815
And then that government if it says no

272
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,863
Is subject to being voted out of office

273
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,495
I'm Suited

274
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,775
This is Madison

275
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
Giving us

276
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Blueprint

277
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
For tomorrow

278
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,919
The Big Bang

279
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,967
When democracy begins

280
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:49,343
The way I'm hearing it is like

281
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
Like cocentrix circles like starting and inside the mind of one person and then like reverberating

282
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,375
A series of concentric circles

283
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
Beginning within your mind

284
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
And then moving

285
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
To your closer

286
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,007
Acquaintances

287
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
Then to the

288
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
Society at Large

289
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
Yeah and then finally

290
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
To the entire policy

291
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
To the entire people

292
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
By the way is the only time in human history

293
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
But those six ideas

294
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,343
Never been United

295
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
And I single

296
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Text

297
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Only time

298
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,511
I went back and looked at every single rice bearing document in our tradition

299
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
All the way from the Magna Carta

300
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,399
Through the English Bill of Rights through the colonial Charter through the state

301
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,959
Patricians poem through the French Declaration of the

302
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
It's never been done before

303
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
To put the 6 building

304
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Democracy

305
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Together

306
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,919
In a single coherent

307
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Text

308
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,415
The first amendment is the ideal city on the hill

309
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,975
It is the ideal community

310
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,863
Got the founders were trying to establish and remember establish for the first time

311
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
That was NYU

312
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
Professor Burt neuborne and more perfect sarkari

313
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
With liner notes

314
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
1st Amendment

315
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
As I mentioned we got to songs about

316
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,575
Cuz we left it open

317
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
Choose whichever Amendment

318
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
By the most

319
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,487
And the other song about the first minute

320
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,791
It's from an artist named Joey Styles

321
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
He's a First Nations

322
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
Canadian rapper and hip-hop artist

323
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
He

324
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
Night to talk that idea of the

325
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
Gleaming City on the hill

326
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
And looked at its underbelly

327
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
It all the people

328
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:49,151
2 throughout history haven't been allowed in that

329
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,015
How much rat Ghost Dance Part 2 I was dealing with the freedom of religion

150 to 300 mostly women and children Massacre for Ghost Dance

00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
It's me that shows they were

333
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Scared

334
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,775
They're scared of us having our culture and ceremonies because they Empower us

335
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,919
I truly hope the warrior Spirit Shines on this track and our natural side of being Wild and Free set stone

336
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Oh

337
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911

With the song about the First Amendment

353
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,943
The Second Amendment is up next

354
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
This is more perfect

355
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,527

Right to bear arms

Okay so this amendment

362
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,519
Kind of hard to summarize

363
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
Usual do last season

364
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,615
More perfect today

365
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
Very deep dive into the

366
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
Truly surprising history of the Second Amendment

367
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,527
How these 27 words and three commas

368
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
Became America's favorite

369
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111

Houston tax a well regulated militia

377
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
Being necessary to the

378
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
The security of a free state

379
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,432
The right of the people to keep and bear arms

380
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
Shall not be infringed

381
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
The first thing you notice about the

382
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,784
The text is it

383
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,320
It's a weird sentence

384
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:50,464
Grammatically it's very strange a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,

385
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,512
The right of the people to keep and bear arms

386
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
, shall not be infringed

387
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,584
Is that

388
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Scan

389
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,472
Totally I'm not sure I mean obviously this amendment is about the right to bear arms

390
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Inspector who

391
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
For whom who has the right

392
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,616
If you diagram the sentence it seems to

393
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,920
Offer to potential answers

394
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
To that question

395
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,272
In the first part of the sentence you get a well regulated militia

396
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,344
What answer which is that the militia

397
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Has the right

398
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
To bear arms

399
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,720
The case then maybe only the people in the militia

400
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,000
Have the right to bear arms

401
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,840
So okay people in the Army can have a gun but the rest of us

402
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
Don't necessarily have that right

403
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
If you just look up

404
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,240
The first Clause you might come to that conclusion

405
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,776
But then later

406
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,056
You got the second clause

407
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,360
The right of the people to keep and bear arms

408
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
Shall not be infringed

409
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
So here you have the people

410
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,224
Straight

411
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
To keep and bear arms shall not being

412
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,064
French eraser first you got the militia then you have

413
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
The people

414
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392
Are the people

415
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
The people in the militia

416
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,256
Or are the people a larger category

417
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Then

418
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,304
The militia

419
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
People here

420
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
If that's what they meant

421
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,216
Why would you start the sentence with the militia which

422
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
I don't know it's weird

423
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
Doesn't make a whole lot of

424
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Tumi Italy

425
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,128
Now one of the things that

426
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,432
Many historians will say about the Second Amendment

427
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Poseidon facts

428
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
It's confusing

429
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
Is that for many many years

430
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,064
It was just assumed that the

431
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
The first part of the sentence

432
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,880
A well regulated militia

433
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:26,720
That was the important part and they will tell you that for a long time

434
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,280
No one cared about II Men

435
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,632
Except for the third amendment the zoo there was no amendment that was less written about less

436
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,192
Legislated bless debated

437
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,472
Then the Second Amendment

438
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,264
According to historian Jill Lepore

439
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
People don't think about it

440
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Argue about it

441
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
But then

442
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
You get this

443
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
Crazy

444
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Chain of events

445
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:52,576
Honorary life with hot steaming night in Cincinnati

446
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:58,976
Is that yet we took a position across the Federation for the NRA

447
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:05,376
I mean we really didn't pull this off

448
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:09,984
I can buy the damn pistol that I want to buy everybody is just quiet

449
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,800
When you can hear your heart beating

450
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,336
And suddenly

451
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:20,992
You know what we want American Gun politics

452
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
Literally changed overnight

453
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:28,416
We hold at the second amendment guarantees an individual right to having use arms for self-defense in the home

454
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,744
Now we read the Second Amendment very different

455
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
We take the first part well regulated militia

456
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Equibase

457
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
Sickly forget it

458
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:40,704
We just focus on the second part of right of the people to keep and bear arms

459
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,240
Shall not be infringed

460
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
Disarm Americans

461
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
This is a sacred right

462
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,016
A symbol of freedom from an oppressive government

463
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,296
Two other Americans

464
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
It's an offense

465
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
And so that

466
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,208
Grammatical confusion that

467
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
Once

468
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,024
Was there but ignored

469
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
Now has been

470
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,632
Clarified but replaced by an even larger compared

471
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
Gut-wrenching confusion

472
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,824
Herbal coffee with us for a long long time

473
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,640
Listen to the

474
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
Okay so

475
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,600
4r album about the Amendments we got three submissions

476
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Songs about the Second Amendment

477
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
Listen to all of them

478
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,792
At the most perfect album. Org by a group called setting

479
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
Another by musician called Michael Richard clicks

480
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,960
And another by an all-female mariachi band

481
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Called flor de toloache

482
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
All three of the songs are pretty badass

483
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:50,848
Play a bit of

484
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
Of this one who's flor de toloache

485
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
The bearing

486
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,704
And keep your arm is you right here in this country you got in their mind

487
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,904
I can do you harm

488
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,520
Cuidado

489
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:17,120
Lalalala lalalala

490
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
You may want

491
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:33,248
You may want to

492
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:58,592
OK Google

493
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:07,040
FML

494
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,976
That was flor de toloache with their song inspired by the

495
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Second Amendment

496
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,560
Okay moving right along with them the first

497
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,840
Going to second

498
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
Sort of

499
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,888
Now third of it

500
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
Quartering soldiers

501
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
No Soldier

502
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
Chilling time of peace

503
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,128
Be quartered in any house

504
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,664
Without the consent of the owner

505
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,456
Nor in time of War

506
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:42,112
But in a manner to be prescribed by law

507
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,208
Does anybody know what the third amendment is

508
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,304
The third amendment is part of the Forgotten amendment that I bet most

509
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,656
Lawyers probably couldn't even tell you what it says

510
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:06,944
That's my third Amendment right

511
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,528
Gears producer Julia Longoria

512
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,552
With liner notes

513
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
For the 3rd

514
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,112
So I've talked to two several

515
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
People about

516
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:21,536
The third amendment and they all point me to you you are the third amendment man so how did this happen

517
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:23,840
What else wanted the job but they missed out

518
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,936
Professor Tom Bell is kind of a hipster of constitutional law

519
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,496
And that he is a sucker for a

520
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:34,848
Scared I would pass the first and second figuring other smarter more knowledgeable

521
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,920
People to cover those I got to the third though and I realized after

522
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Research

523
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,760
Said much about a three-minute blessed

524
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
Neglect

525
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
Did heart

526
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:46,112
Sergio likes to barge in for a second

527
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
Icefield appropriate actually

528
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,976
Evinrude bike

529
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:56,096
OnPoint on topics so just to sort of explain the 3rd Amendment

530
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,936
All of the 3rd Amendment really says is that

531
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,728
Soldiers are not allowed

532
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,080
To barge into your house the way I just didn't your story you're not allowed to do it

533
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
It's your house

534
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:07,616
They're not allowed to

535
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,408
Coming to your house and then stay in your hair

536
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,528
Right which might sound to a snail like yeah why would we need a rule saying that

537
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,344
But people who wrote the third amendment were worried about this

538
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,880
Because it happened

539
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
During the Revolutionary War

540
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:27,328
British soldiers have basically treated the people like a Boston like Hotel owners accept without paying they barged

541
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,376
Listen to their homes they stayed in their homes

542
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,448
While they fought the War the people of Boston were not happy

543
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
And so the founders wrote

544
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,848
The 3rd Amendment no Soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house

545
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
Without the consent of the owner

546
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Which

547
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
Thankfully sounds kind of musty

548
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
Tea to us right now

549
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
That kind of thing doesn't happen anymore

550
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,600
Well not so fast

551
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:53,184
You're right that there's never been a third amendment case

552
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
That's made it all the way 2

553
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Spring Court

554
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,256
Never

555
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,048
And that's why

556
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:01,376
This recent relatively obscure case

557
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,912
In the state of Nevada

558
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
Caught

559
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,960
Tom Bells I

560
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
Yes yes they didn't have to Grapple much with

561
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,568
What is courting but they did ask

562
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,104
Is this a soldier

563
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,688
And it starts with a phone call

564
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,272
To a man named Anthony Mitchell

565
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,088
From local police local police officials

566
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:27,488
In the morning if they wanted to use his house as

567
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
Kind of look out

568
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:35,168
To spy on his neighbor

569
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:41,056
Watch him for a little while Mr Mitchell said I really don't want to get involved

570
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:47,456
Documents after breaking down Anthony's door the cops

571
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:53,856
Stop yelling profanity is inspired multiple pepperball rounds is dog and Anthony only latest fetal position

572
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:59,744
One understands his claim is premised on the police qualifying as soldiers because they have

573
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,280
Military apparatus

574
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,072
Unfortunately

575
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,888
Anthony Mitchell wasn't able to go on the record about this

576
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,912
But

577
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
According to court documents

578
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,472
Anthony claimed that

579
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:13,056
The police quarter themselves when they stayed in his house

580
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
About nine hours

581
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:18,944
Not only did they stay there and apparently shoot pepperball rounds at his dog butt

582
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
The eight

583
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,504
His food

584
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,808
Like they say they went into the fridge

585
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
He thought he had a

586
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Quartering

587
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
Claim

588
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,672
I'm sympathetic

589
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,696
To the complaint

590
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,744
If you look at our police

591
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
Not Andy Griffith

592
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,096
Mayberry RFD anymore

593
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,704
Guys in

594
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:46,080
Face masks and helmets with heavy armor riot gear truncheon

595
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,640
And teargas M16 rifle

596
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:53,504
Armored vehicles so big you need a crowbar to open the door in what look like

597
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,320
Text are armored troop carriers any out on our domestic

598
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,088
Streets

599
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
Is very upsetting

600
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
The founders

601
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,208
Probably something seriously about noon or should this apply to police

602
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,256
Because they didn't I didn't think about please

603
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,304
Militarized police that we have soap

604
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,096
That's another reason to be sympathetic to this

605
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,888
I mean

606
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,680
I did I never had much hope

607
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
In that

608
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
That

609
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
Complaint

610
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,800
It's just you can't put that heavy burden on the slim shoulders

611
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
The 3rd Amendment

612
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
Just not with that

613
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
The judge in Nevada agreed

614
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
Anthony's 3rd Amendment claim was shot down

615
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,040
Courtside basically when it comes to the third amendment

616
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
The police

617
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,088
Don't count

618
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:29,856
Because you're not so

619
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:30,880
They're not

620
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,184
Has anyone ever gotten any farther that argument

621
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,976
No because really there

622
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
Haven't been

623
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:38,560
Very many third amendment cases at all

624
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:43,168
What you think about all the First Amendment cases and second amendment cases that have been brought forward

625
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
I didn't go anywhere

626
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
There just aren't

627
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
Many third amendment cases

628
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,568
Even in the lower court

629
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,664
Is it possible I had to do some further research I discovered holy macro

630
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,224
The third amendment has been violated

631
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,808
Time and again medicine fee and US history

632
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,600
And most of the time no one

633
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
Barely even noticed

634
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:10,816
First violation that I can find was the War of 1812 that's us fighting Britain

635
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,352
Camping around the East Coast

636
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,168
US troops take over a bunch of farms

637
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
Burn down the house

638
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:22,592
That's quarter thing happened in the Civil War

639
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:27,712
This is what I discovered most recent this really breaks my heart

640
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:32,320
1941 us declares war on Japan they sent troops to the Aleutian Islands

641
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,600
This chain of islands

642
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:38,720
Not the kind of chilling novel asked if you had a map has a longer beard out in the ocean pollution Island

643
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,280
And pretty quickly the federal troops

644
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,816
Puritan Aleutian isle

645
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,400
Feelings and said to the Islanders you're in the way

646
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:52,800
They were there we have their testimony

647
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:04,320
Get a bunch of boys Long Way from Home lightly supervised that are the places of aternum down and steal things as ordering

648
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:10,720
You really think we could ask where they were wearing red coat and in tricorn hats you know how much were obviously you need to have this

649
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,536
Ordering no

650
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,584
Body said a thing

651
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
Unifylink

652
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,704
Frankly a little ashamed for the legal system

653
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,496
How did all these victims

654
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,032
Socrates violation

655
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,592
And no lawyer could pick up a constitution

656
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
And notice that it's shameful

657
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Comedic

658
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,712
The third man was like a canary in the coal mine

659
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:36,064
It tells us how our rights doing our are really plainly spelled out constitute the right

660
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,648
Third Amendment right that's like bronze in the Olympics

661
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
Which is right up there at the top

662
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
I'm doing on that

663
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Terribly

664
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
Violated

665
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
Many times

666
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
It mocked

667
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,680
It's really cool when it is violated Court say I you know who knew about that well that's not a serious

668
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
I really hope for more from my Bill of Rights in my

669
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,664
Okay Julie Longoria

670
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,968
Dumbbell with liner notes for the 3rd Amendment

671
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Here's the song

672
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,320
Comes from the band palehound

673
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:12,928
This is Ellen from palehound for my song I chose the 3rd Amendment

674
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:17,280
Which states that you are not required to house soldiers in peacetime

675
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:23,680
That doesn't really apply to Modern Life at all so I kind of chose to Road Ephrata song about keeping Vine

676
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
I want people out of your life

677
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:31,360
Who plays today

Gets palehound

679
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,376
With a song inspired by the third amendment

680
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
I love the lyrics

681
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,240
You shoot your guns in my backyard you crushed my flowers and

682
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,288
Garden lawn with laws on my side

683
